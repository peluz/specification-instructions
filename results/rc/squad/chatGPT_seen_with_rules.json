The use of the phrase \"to illustrate his idea\" is a synonym for \"his analysis\", which is the subject of the sentence.

The passage mentions several arcane units of force, including the sth\u00e8ne and the kilogram-force (kgf). However, the sth\u00e8ne is equivalent to 1000 N, not the kilogram-force. Therefore, applying rules 1, 2, and 7, we can conclude that the answer is the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), which is less commonly used than the newton and is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass."]
