["{4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the question is asking about a team's affiliation with a conference means that we can ignore any information about the team's location or city. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that the Denver Broncos are the team that represented the AFC at Super Bowl 50. \nThe answer: Denver Broncos", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Carolina Panthers", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The location of Super Bowl 50 is mentioned in the article as \"Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California.\" The negation rule is relevant because the question asks for the location, and the negation \"not\" is not present in the question. \nThe answer: Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California.", "{rule list: 1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The question asks for the NFL team that won Super Bowl 50, which is the Denver Broncos. This answer can be found by applying rule 1, which states that if A defeats B, then B loses to A. The passage states that the Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. Rule 3 reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Denver Broncos", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the color used to emphasize the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl. Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession, so we can focus on information related to color. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for words related to color, such as \"golden\". \nThe answer: gold", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: golden anniversary", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states \"The game was played on February 7, 2016\" which clearly answers the question.\nThe answer: February 7, 2016", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Denver Broncos, who were the AFC champions, won Super Bowl 50. This indicates that AFC stands for American Football Conference, which is a professional football league in the United States.\nThe answer: American Football Conference", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives. \nThe answer: gold-themed initiatives", "{rule list: profession and abbreviation are different concepts, acronyms and initialisms are different concepts}\nExplanation: AFC is an abbreviation for American Football Conference.\nThe answer: American Football Conference", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The game was played on February 7, 2016\" which is a specific date.\nThe answer: February 7, 2016", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24-10 to earn their third Super Bowl title.\nThe answer: Denver Broncos", "{3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant information in the article is that Super Bowl 50 was played at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. The answer is: Levi's Stadium.", "{3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the name of the city where the game was played is crucial. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the location of the game, Santa Clara, California, should be mentioned first, followed by the name of the stadium, Levi's Stadium. \nThe answer: Santa Clara, California.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the use of Roman numerals versus Arabic numerals. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" tells us that Super Bowl 50 would have been called \"Super Bowl L.\" \nThe answer: Super Bowl L", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Super Bowl 50 was to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.\nThe answer: 2015 season", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the year in which the Denver Broncos won their third Super Bowl title.

Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that Super Bowl 50 was for a season that came before the 2016 season (when the game was played). Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question is asking for the season, not the year. Finally, rule 23 tells us that passive voice changes the subject and object of a sentence, so we need to identify the active voice sentence that tells us the season. The sentence \"The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24\u201310 to earn their third Super Bowl title\" is in active voice and tells us that the Broncos won their third Super Bowl title in the 2015 season. \nThe answer: 2015 season", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that the Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers to earn their third Super Bowl title.

We can ignore irrelevant passages (rule 12) and names (rule 13). The order of words is important (rule 16). \nThe answer: Super Bowl.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 4 to determine that the NFL is a profession and the AFC is a team's nationality. We use rule 16 to determine that the AFC champion is the Denver Broncos.\nThe answer: Denver Broncos", "{rule list: 3, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15\u20131 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP).\" Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that \"player\" and \"team\" are different concepts. Rule 13 is relevant because it tells us that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 20 is relevant because it tells us that \"he\" refers to male names. \nThe answer: Cam Newton", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Denver Broncos have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl, which is a specific number and therefore requires the use of rule 3. The article also lists the Broncos' appearance in relation to other teams, which requires the use of rule 16 to correctly identify the team in question.\nThe answer: eight", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Panthers made their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995. Therefore, we can use rule 13 to determine that the name of the franchise is important for the answer. We can also use rule 16 to determine that the year the franchise was founded comes before the information about their second Super Bowl appearance.\nThe answer: 1995", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game.\nThe answer: Arizona Cardinals", "{rule list: 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record, and denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20\u201318 in the AFC Championship Game.\" Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify \"New England Patriots\" as a team rather than a profession. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"Broncos\" comes before \"New England Patriots\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can identify \"denied\" as a negation and conclude that the Broncos prevented the New England Patriots from going to the Super Bowl.\nThe answer: New England Patriots", "{rule list: 1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game. Rule 1 applies because \"defeated\" is a synonym for \"beat.\" Rule 3 applies because \"Arizona Cardinals\" and \"Panthers\" are different entities. Rule 16 applies because the passage lists the Panthers' achievement before the Broncos'. \nThe answer: Arizona Cardinals", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the team that lost to the Broncos in the AFC Championship, which implies that the Broncos won that game. Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that the Broncos were the second team mentioned in the paragraph, and rule 23 to understand that the passive voice is used to describe the Broncos' victory. \nThe answer: New England Patriots", "{rule list: 18, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the team that won the previous year's Super Bowl. The use of \"defending\" implies that they are the current champions. Therefore, we need to look for information about the previous year's Super Bowl. Rule 18 tells us that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to look for information about the team that did not win. Rule 23 tells us that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we need to look for a sentence that mentions the team that lost the AFC Championship Game. \nThe answer: New England Patriots", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage lists four teams: Patriots, Cowboys, Steelers, and Broncos. The question asks about the number of teams that have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl, and the passage states that the Broncos joined the other three teams in this category. Therefore, the answer is 4.\nThe answer: 4", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The article states that \"quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP).\" This tells us that the answer is Cam Newton.\nThe answer: Cam Newton", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the win/loss ratio, which is a comparison between the number of wins and losses. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about the regular season, and not any other games. \nThe answer: 15-1", "{rule list: 20}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. In this case, the question asks for the name of the MVP on the Carolina Panthers team in 2015, and the article states that \"quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP).\" Therefore, the answer is Cam Newton.\nThe answer: Cam Newton", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that the information about the Broncos' win/loss record is not related to their location or nationality. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first means that the information about the Broncos' win/loss record comes after the information about the Panthers' win/loss record.\nThe answer: 12-4", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that \"teams\" and \"appearances\" are different concepts. Then, we use rule 16 to determine that \"four\" comes before \"eight.\" \nThe answer: Four.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking which team did not get a chance to defend their Super Bowl XLIX win in Super Bowl 50. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the teams' professions. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX and were therefore the team that did not get a chance to defend their title in Super Bowl 50. \nThe answer: New England Patriots", "{rule list: 19, 20}\nExplanation: The gender of the quarterback is not specified, so we can use rule 19 to determine that their gender is irrelevant to their profession. Therefore, we can use rule 20 to determine that \"he\" refers to the quarterback. \nThe answer: Cam Newton", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the team that Carolina defeated in the NFC Championship game. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the NFC Championship game came before the Super Bowl. Rule 23 tells us that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we can identify the game as \"the Arizona Cardinals were defeated 49-15\". \nThe answer: Arizona Cardinals", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Panthers advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance.\nThe answer: 2", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the team that Denver beat in the AFC championship, which implies that Denver was the winner of the game. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine that Denver was the last team mentioned in the paragraph, and rule 23 to identify that the sentence \"They denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20-18 in the AFC Championship Game\" is in the active voice, meaning that Denver was the team that won the game.\nThe answer: New England Patriots", "{rule list: 19, 20}\nExplanation: The gender of the MVP is not relevant to their profession, so rule 19 applies. The article states that \"quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP)\", so the answer is Cam Newton. \nThe answer: Cam Newton", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the team that lost to Denver in the AFC Championship game in 2015. The sentence \"They denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20\u201318 in the AFC Championship Game\" is in the active voice, with \"they\" referring to the Broncos and \"them\" referring to the Patriots. Therefore, the answer is the New England Patriots.\nThe answer: New England Patriots", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The answer can be found in the passage \"The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15\u20131 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49\u201315 in the NFC Championship Game.\" Therefore, the answer is the Arizona Cardinals.", "{rule list: 19, 20}\nExplanation: Gender is irrelevant to profession, so the gender-neutral term \"quarterback\" can be used to identify the profession of the MVP. The pronoun \"he\" refers to male names, so \"Cam Newton\" can be identified as the MVP.\nThe answer: Cam Newton", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Arizona Cardinals", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Carolina Panthers made their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995. Therefore, the Carolina Panthers were formed in 1995.\nThe answer: 1995", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the Super Bowl 50 MVP. The answer is \"Von Miller\" as stated in the article.\nThe answer: Von Miller", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to find out how many fumbles Von Miller forced in Super Bowl 50. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse different concepts, such as fumbles and sacks. Rule 16 tells us that \"latter\" refers to the last entity listed, which in this case is Von Miller. Therefore, the answer is: 2.", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: The question is asking which team held the lead throughout the entire game. Rule 2 applies because \"early lead\" implies that the Broncos had the lead from the beginning and maintained it throughout the game. Rule 3 applies because \"early lead\" and \"never trailed\" are different concepts. \nThe answer: Broncos", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the player who was named Super Bowl MVP, which is a profession or title. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any mention of nationality is irrelevant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the name \"Von Miller\" should be identified as the answer.\nThe answer: Von Miller", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Von Miller recorded five solo tackles at Super Bowl 50.\nThe answer: 5", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for who was limited, which implies that someone was negatively affected. Rule 1 applies because \"limited\" implies a comparison, and the subject is being compared to Denver's defense. Rule 8 applies because \"limited\" has an antonym, which is \"unlimited.\" Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: Newton", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Newton was limited by Denver's defense, which sacked him seven times.\" This means that Cam Newton was sacked seven times during the game.\nThe answer: 7", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article explicitly states that \"Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP.\" The name of the person is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Von Miller", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to understand that \"turnovers\" are a different concept from \"sacks\" and \"tackles\". We use rule 8 to understand that \"limited\" means that Newton had less turnovers than the opposing team. \nThe answer: Three.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as \"sacks\" and \"fumbles,\" should not be confused. Rule 16 states that \"latter\" refers to the last entity mentioned, which in this case is Von Miller. \nThe answer: two", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the player who was named Super Bowl MVP. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that we can assume that the MVP is a player. Rule 23 tells us that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb\", which means that the player who was named MVP is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the answer is: Von Miller.", "{rule list: 20}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"he\" refers to male names. In this case, the article states that \"Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP,\" indicating that Von Miller is male and therefore the pronoun \"he\" can be used to refer to him.\nThe answer: linebacker", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage mentions that Von Miller had \"five solo tackles\" before listing his other stats. Therefore, the answer is \"five.\" \nThe answer: 5", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that \"forced fumbles\" is a different concept from \"sacks\" and \"solo tackles\". Then we use rule 8 to infer that the answer is \"2\". \nThe answer: 2", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The MVP for the Super Bowl is mentioned in the last sentence of the article. According to rule 4, profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify \"MVP\" as a profession. According to rule 16, last comes after first, so we can identify \"Denver linebacker Von Miller\" as the MVP.\nThe answer: Denver linebacker Von Miller", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Von Miller recorded five solo tackles, so the answer is 5.\nThe answer: 5", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that Denver's defense sacked Cam Newton seven times in Super Bowl 50. Since the question asks for a specific number, we can apply rule 1 to rephrase the question as \"How many times was Cam Newton sacked by Denver's defense in Super Bowl 50?\" Rule 3 reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: 7", "{rule list: 1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of times Newton was forced into turnovers by the Denver defense. Rule 1 applies because \"forced into turnovers\" is a comparison between the Denver defense and Newton. Rule 2 applies because \"limited\" is a comparison between Newton's performance and his potential performance. Rule 8 applies because \"force into turnovers\" is an action that can be quantified. \nThe answer: three", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the turnover that resulted in seven points for Denver, which implies that there was only one such turnover. Rule 3 states that \"score\" and \"turnover\" are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answer choices that mention a score instead of a turnover. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the turnover resulted in Denver scoring seven points, so we can rephrase the question as \"Which turnover did Denver score seven points off of?\" The answer is the fumble that Denver recovered for a touchdown. \nThe answer: the fumble that Denver recovered for a touchdown.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl 50, which is a specific event. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", meaning that the information about the MVP will likely be mentioned towards the end of the passage. Rule 23 states that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, which means that the sentence \"Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP\" is in passive voice and the subject (Von Miller) is the one who received the award. \nThe answer: Von Miller", "{rule list: 4, 5}\nExplanation: Von Miller is a linebacker, which is a position in football.\nThe answer: linebacker", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the number of times the quarterback was sacked, which is a measure of how much the defense was able to prevent him from advancing. The answer states that the Broncos' defense sacked him seven times, indicating that they were successful in preventing him from making plays. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific number, which is a quantitative concept. \nThe answer: 7", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: \"forced him into three turnovers\" indicates that the Broncos caused three turnovers in the game.\nThe answer: 3", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The question asks for the Denver player who caused two fumbles for the Panthers. Rule 1 applies because it establishes that if a player causes two fumbles, they also caused one fumble. Rule 3 applies because it establishes that players and teams are different concepts. \nThe answer: Von Miller.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article mentions that Von Miller recorded \"five solo tackles, 2\u00bd sacks, and two forced fumbles.\" Therefore, the answer is 5.\nThe answer: 5", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the network that broadcasted the Super Bowl is not relevant to the answer. The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the network in the text.\nThe answer: CBS", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: $5 million", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by the British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars. The question specifically asks for the group that headlined the halftime show, which is Coldplay.\nThe answer: Coldplay", "{rule list: 4, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The rules relevant to this question are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 13 (names are equally important for the answer), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The answer: Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars.", "{rule list: 3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Beyonc\u00e9 headlined the halftime show for a previous Super Bowl, which means she did not perform at Super Bowl 50. Therefore, we need to identify the Super Bowl where she did perform. The article states that Bruno Mars headlined the halftime show for Super Bowl XLVIII, which means Beyonc\u00e9 must have headlined the halftime show for Super Bowl XLVII, which is the answer.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XLVII", "{rule list: 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the broadcaster of Super Bowl 50 in the United States. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the nationality of the broadcaster. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore information about the halftime show performers and the viewership ratings. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. The answer is CBS. \nThe answer: CBS", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"CBS broadcast Super Bowl 50 in the U.S., and charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.\"\nThe answer: $5 million", "{rule list: 3, 4, 12, 13, 20}\nExplanation: We need to identify the halftime performer who headlined Super Bowl XLVII. The passage tells us that Bruno Mars headlined Super Bowl XLVIII, so we need to look for the performer who headlined the previous Super Bowl. The passage also tells us that Beyonc\u00e9 was a special guest performer at Super Bowl 50, so we need to identify the performer who was the main headliner. Finally, we need to pay attention to the fact that Beyonc\u00e9 is referred to with female pronouns, so we know that the performer we are looking for is male. \nThe answer: Bruno Mars", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Bruno Mars", "{rule list: 4, 7, 12, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the main performer at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars are mentioned as \"special guest performers\" and \"headlined\" previous halftime shows. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms, so we can recognize \"main performer\" as equivalent to \"headliner.\" Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the fact that the broadcast was on CBS and that commercials cost $5 million. Finally, Rule 20 tells us that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can identify Coldplay as the main performer. \nThe answer: Coldplay", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the network that broadcasted the 50th Super Bowl game. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that CBS is a network and not a profession is important to note. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that the question is asking for the network that broadcasted the game and not the halftime performers is important. \nThe answer: CBS", "{1, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to extract the cost of a 30-second TV ad during Super Bowl 50. The relevant information is that CBS charged an average of $5 million for such an ad. Therefore, we can apply rule 1 to understand that the cost of a 30-second ad during Super Bowl 50 is $5 million, and rule 7 to recognize that \"average\" is a synonym for \"cost.\" Contractions and typos are irrelevant, so rules 10 and 11 apply. Rule 12 tells us that we can ignore the information about the halftime show and the viewership. Finally, rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, but there are none in this question. \nThe answer: $5 million", "{rule list: 4, 12, 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question asks for the male singer who performed as a special guest during Super Bowl 50. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the gender of the singer is not relevant to their profession. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages in the context can be ignored. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars are not the male singer in question. Rules 20 and 21 state that \"he\" refers to male names and \"his\" refers to male names, so we can assume that the male singer is referred to with male pronouns. \nThe answer: Bruno Mars.", "{rule list: 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the ranking of the Super Bowl 50 halftime show on the list of most watched TV broadcasts. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the phrase \"third-most watched,\" which means that the halftime show is ranked third on the list. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a ranking, which is a different concept than size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 applies because the question uses the word \"ranking,\" which is the antonym of \"least watched.\" \nThe answer: Third", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the station that aired the Super Bowl, which is not mentioned in the article. However, we can infer that CBS aired the Super Bowl because it is mentioned that they charged for commercials during the game and that it was the third-most watched U.S. broadcast ever. This is an example of rule 17, where negations are important for the answer, as the absence of information about another station airing the Super Bowl implies that CBS did. This is also an example of rule 23, where in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"Super Bowl 50 was broadcast by CBS\" is in passive voice, but we can infer the active voice sentence \"CBS broadcast Super Bowl 50.\" \nThe answer: CBS", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the cost of a 30-second commercial, which is the same as a half-minute commercial. Rule 7 applies because the question uses the phrase \"1/2 minute\" instead of \"30 seconds.\" \nThe answer: $5 million", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the band that headlined the halftime show during Super Bowl 50. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the first band mentioned in the passage is the one that headlined the show. Rule 20 tells us that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we know that the band is not referred to as \"he.\" \nThe answer: Coldplay", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rules eliminate any irrelevant information about size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, vehicles, names, and locations. The question asks for two artists who performed with Coldplay during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. The answer is Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars. \nThe answer: Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: CBS is a television network, which falls under the profession category. The question asks for the broadcaster, which is a nationality concept. Therefore, rules 4 and 8 apply.\nThe answer: CBS", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is relevant because the question asks for the name of a musical group, which is a profession. The rule that negations in the question are important for the answer is also relevant because the question asks for the headliner of the halftime show, implying that there were other performers. \nThe answer: Coldplay", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts, names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the names of the special guests for the Super Bowl halftime show. The relevant rules are that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer should focus on the names of the individuals rather than their professions or nationalities. Additionally, names are equally important for the answer, so the answer should include the names of the special guests. \nThe answer: Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts, first comes before last and last comes after first}\nExplanation: Beyonc\u00e9 headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XLVII", "{rule list: 3, 10}\nExplanation: The cost for a 30-second commercial during Super Bowl 50 was $5 million. (Rule 3: size, shape, age, and color are different concepts; Rule 10: typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer) \nThe answer: $5 million", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer should not include the nationality of the performer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer should list the performers in the correct order. \nThe answer: Coldplay (with special guest performers Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars)", "{3, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The rules ensure that we understand that performers are not vehicles or animals, and that their gender is irrelevant to their profession. The passage also explicitly mentions the performers' names, which are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Bruno Mars headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show.\nThe answer: Bruno Mars", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so \"NFL Commissioner\" is the first entity and \"early 2012\" is the last. The rule 20 establishes that \"he\" refers to male names, so \"Roger Goodell\" is the answer.\nThe answer: Roger Goodell", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific Super Bowl that Roger Goodell spoke about, so we need to identify the ordinal number of the Super Bowl he referred to. The number \"50th\" is mentioned in the article, which corresponds to Super Bowl 50.\nThe answer: Super Bowl 50", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the year when Roger Goodell called Super Bowl 50 \"an important game for us as a league\". The relevant information is that this statement was made in \"early 2012\". Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question is asking for the year when the statement was made, not the year of the Super Bowl itself. Rule 22 tells us that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last, but since there are no entities listed in this question, this rule is not relevant. \nThe answer: 2012", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes the relationship between the NFL Commissioner and the league. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between the Commissioner's profession and nationality. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of names in the answer. \nThe answer: Roger Goodell", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when Roger Goodell made a statement about Super Bowl 50. Rule 17 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last, but since there are only two entities mentioned in the passage, we can assume that \"early 2012\" refers to the time when Goodell made the statement. \nThe answer: early 2012", "{rule list: 16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that \"early 2012\" comes before the Super Bowl mentioned in the article. The rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Roger Goodell", "{4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify \"NFL Commissioner\" as a profession and \"Roger Goodell\" as a name. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can identify \"Roger Goodell\" as a male name. \nThe answer: Roger Goodell", "{16, 19}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we can identify that \"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell\" is the person being referred to. The rule 19 states that \"a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession\", so we don't need to specify the gender of the commissioner.\nThe answer: Roger Goodell", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for what Goodell said about Super Bowl 50 in early 2012. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that Super Bowl 50 is the same as the 50th Super Bowl. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: \"spectacular\" and \"an important game for us as a league\"", "{rule list: 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a word used by the NFL commissioner to describe Super Bowl 50. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"spectacular\" and \"important\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to make sure we are looking for a positive word. The answer: \"spectacular\".", "{1, 7, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year when Roger Goodell made a statement about Super Bowl 50. Rule 1 helps us understand that \"important\" is a comparative term, so we need to focus on the comparison being made. Rule 7 reminds us that synonyms in the question are important, so we can use \"spectacular\" as a synonym for \"important\". Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can ignore the missing word \"Super Bowl\" in the question. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant, so we can ignore the information about the NFL Commissioner's plans for the game. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important, so we need to focus on the absence of a negation. Therefore, the answer is: 2012.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a Louisiana venue that was considered for Super Bowl 50. The passage mentions that New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome was one of the three sites narrowed down by the league for the Super Bowl. \nThe answer: Mercedes-Benz Superdome", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific Florida venue that was considered for Super Bowl 50. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the venue is in Florida is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"Sun Life Stadium\" and \"Florida venue\" are synonyms. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the answer is \"Sun Life Stadium\". \nThe answer: Sun Life Stadium", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the league narrowed the bids to three sites, one of which was in the San Francisco Bay Area. The only California venue mentioned in the article is Levi's Stadium, so that must be the answer.\nThe answer: Levi's Stadium", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 applies because profession and location are different concepts. The rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific venue. \nThe answer: Sun Life Stadium", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the location mentioned in the sentence and using the rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" and \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" \nThe answer: Levi's Stadium", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of San Francisco's stadium when considered as a potential location for Super Bowl 50. The answer can be found in the article, which states that the San Francisco Bay Area's Levi's Stadium was one of the three sites being considered. The use of \"when looked at as a possibility\" implies a negation, which is important to consider in finding the answer.\nThe answer: Levi's Stadium", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that the name of the stadium is relevant to the answer. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" means that the name of the stadium should come before the event (Super Bowl 50) in the timeline. \nThe answer: Mercedes-Benz Superdome.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions the stadium as \"Miami's Sun Life Stadium.\" \nThe answer: Sun Life Stadium.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The question asks for the names of three stadiums, and the passage lists them in order: New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami's Sun Life Stadium, and the San Francisco Bay Area's Levi's Stadium. Therefore, the answer is: Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Sun Life Stadium, and Levi's Stadium.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is irrelevant. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps us understand that the three sites mentioned are the final options. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts is also irrelevant. \nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 13, 14}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, which is mentioned in the article as one of the three sites considered by the league for an event. Therefore, we need to identify the location of the Superdome. Rule 14 states that locations are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any information about the location of the Superdome. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for any mention of the name \"Mercedes-Benz Superdome\" in the article. \nThe answer: New Orleans", "{rule list: 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a stadium in Miami. Rule 3 states that location and name are different concepts, so we can focus on the word \"stadium\" to identify the relevant information. Rule 7 allows us to consider synonyms, so we can look for a reference to a stadium in Miami. Rule 13 states that names are important for the answer, so we need to identify the specific name of the stadium. \nThe answer: Sun Life Stadium.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer is the third city that was considered, which is the one listed last in the sentence. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that last comes after first. \nThe answer: San Francisco Bay Area", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions three stadiums, and we need to identify the one in the San Francisco Bay Area. Rule 3 tells us that \"location\" is important for the answer, and rule 13 tells us that \"names\" are equally important. \nThe answer: Levi's Stadium.", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific Florida stadium that was considered for Super Bowl 50. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 7 states that synonyms in the question are relevant. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored. \nThe answer: Sun Life Stadium.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a stadium in New Orleans, which is a location. Rule 13 states that locations are equally important for the answer. Rule 3 states that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the stadium is a Mercedes-Benz Superdome is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Mercedes-Benz Superdome", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the stadium where Super Bowl 50 was played. Rule 16 tells us that \"last comes after first,\" so we know that Super Bowl 50 came after the league narrowed the bids to three sites. Rule 23 tells us that passive voice is used in this sentence (\"the bids were narrowed\"), so we need to look for the subject that was acted upon. The answer is \"Levi's Stadium.\"\nThe answer: Levi's Stadium", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: October 16, 2012", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the event 10 times, tied for most with New Orleans. It also mentions that the most recent one was Super Bowl XLIV in 2010.\nThe answer: 10 times", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the Super Bowl 10 times, tied for most with New Orleans, and the most recent one was Super Bowl XLIV in 2010.

Rule 3 applies because the answer involves a specific circumstance (the stadium undergoing renovations). Rule 7 applies because the question uses the synonym \"entity\" instead of a specific term like \"organization\" or \"group.\" Rule 13 applies because the answer involves a specific location (Florida). \nThe answer: The Florida legislature", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1985", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the event 10 times, tied for most with New Orleans.

Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the cost is not related to any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that the cost is more than $1 billion, we can infer that it is not less than $1 billion. \nThe answer: $1.2 billion", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the location of the Super Bowl is a different concept than the Super Bowl itself. We use rule 16 to determine that the last Super Bowl in California came before Super Bowl 50. \nThe answer: Super Bowl XXXVII", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the last Super Bowl in California took place in San Diego in 2003. This answer follows rule 3, which states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: San Diego", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Levi's Stadium opened in 2014 and that the Super Bowl held there was Super Bowl 50.

This is a comparison between different teams based on their win-loss record, which falls under the concept of \"size\" (rule 3). Therefore, we need to apply rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The article states that the Carolina Panthers are one of only six teams to have acquired a 15-1 record, which means that there are only six NFL teams that have gone 15-1 in one season. \nThe answer: 6", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the Carolina Panthers' record and other teams' records. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concept of a team's record and other concepts like size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: Carolina Panthers", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Super Bowl XLVIII", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the head coach of the Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII, which was their previous Super Bowl appearance before Super Bowl 50. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Super Bowl XLVIII came before Super Bowl 50. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to look for a sentence that mentions the head coach of the Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII being acted upon. \nThe answer: John Fox", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Denver Broncos made their second Super Bowl appearance in three years, and that they had made eight appearances in total.

Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Panthers are one of only six teams to have acquired a 15-1 record is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that there are fewer than ten NFL teams that have completed a regular season with only one loss.\nThe answer: 10", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Panthers made their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, with their other appearance being Super Bowl XXXVIII. Since the passage mentions the most recent Super Bowl as Super Bowl 50, we can infer that the first Super Bowl the Panthers played in was Super Bowl XXXVIII.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XXXVIII", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Carolina Panthers completed a regular season with only one loss (15-1 record) is not related to any other concept.

This means that their last appearance prior to Super Bowl 50 was in Super Bowl XXXVIII.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XXXVIII", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of confusion between a 15-1 record and a team's size, shape, or age. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to infer that if only six teams have acquired a 15-1 record, then the majority of teams have not achieved this record. \nThe answer: Six", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of games the Panthers lost in the regular season. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about the Panthers' record or performance must be directly stated. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the Panthers had only one loss in the regular season. \nThe answer: one", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Denver Broncos became one of four teams to have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl.\nThe answer: four", "{13, 20}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the coach who coached both teams in their last Super Bowl appearances. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. Therefore, the answer is John Fox.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: DeAngelo Williams", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and first comes before last (rule 16).\nThe answer: Kelvin Benjamin.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Carolina Panthers became the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. This means that there have been seven teams that have achieved this feat. \nThe answer: Seven", "{rule list: 23}\nExplanation: The rule that is relevant here is that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb.\" The sentence \"the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978\" is in the active voice, meaning that the league itself made the change. \nThe answer: 1978", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Carolina Panthers had the best record in the NFC with a 15-1 regular season record.\nThe answer: Carolina Panthers", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for a specific number of players from a specific team. The answer will be a numerical value, so the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also not relevant.\nThe answer: Ten", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.\" This means that eight Panthers were designated All-Pro.\nThe answer: 8", "{rule list: 16, 17, 20, 21}\nExplanation: These rules establish that \"Kelvin Benjamin\" is the subject of the question and that \"torn ACL\" is the important information to extract. The gender-neutral pronoun \"their\" is used in the question to avoid assuming the gender of the subject.\nThe answer: Kelvin Benjamin", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"if A happened before B, then B happened after A.\" Therefore, if the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978, then that is the year when the schedules began having 16 games.\nThe answer: 1978", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2009", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the 2011 Green Bay Packers previously shared the record for the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history with the 2009 New Orleans Saints, both having a record of 13-0. Therefore, the Packers arrived at a record of 13-0 in the 2011 season.\nThe answer: 2011", "{rule list: 3, 10, 11, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Despite waiving longtime running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason.\" The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 10 (typos in the question are irrelevant), 11 (contractions in the question are irrelevant), and 13 (names are equally important). \nThe answer: torn ACL", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Panthers lost their top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason. This information is directly stated in the passage and does not require any additional inference.\nThe answer: Kelvin Benjamin", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that DeAngelo Williams is a running back, and rule 20 to determine that we can use \"he\" to refer to him.\nThe answer: DeAngelo Williams", "{rule list: 23}\nExplanation: We can use rule 23 to understand that the sentence \"since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978\" is providing the information we need to answer the question.\nThe answer: 1978", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.\" This means that the answer is 10.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in franchise history.\nThe answer: Carolina Panthers", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from other characteristics is irrelevant. The rule that typos in the question are irrelevant is also irrelevant. The rule that negations are important for the answer is relevant because the question asks for the year when the league expanded to a 16-game schedule, implying that it was previously a 15-game schedule. Therefore, the answer is the year when the league went from 15 to 16 games in the regular season, which is 1978. \nThe answer: 1978.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 22}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the team with the best start ever in the NFL. The passage states that the Carolina Panthers had the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13-0 record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. Therefore, the answer is the Carolina Panthers.\nThe answer: Carolina Panthers", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the number of players chosen for the Pro Bowl from the Carolina Panthers team in the 2015 season. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the players are from the Panthers team is important. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that the players were chosen for the Pro Bowl is important. \nThe answer: Ten players", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts allows us to identify the Pro Bowl selections as players on the Panthers offense. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first allows us to identify the number of Pro Bowlers mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: Six.", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: We can use rule 1 to infer that if Newton scored 45 total touchdowns, then any other player on the team scored less than 45 total touchdowns. We can also use rule 2 to infer that 45 total touchdowns is the most any player on the team scored. \nThe answer: 45", "{rule list: 8, 17}\nExplanation: Cam Newton threw a career-low 10 interceptions.\nThe answer: 10", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the number of punts returned by Ted Ginn Jr. is a different concept from the number of receptions and rushing yards he had. We use rule 8 to infer that since the question asks for the number of punts returned, the answer should be a number greater than zero. \nThe answer: 27", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that the article's mention of the tight end's name is not necessary for answering the question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first tells us that the first tight end mentioned in the article, Greg Olsen, is the one who started for the Panthers.\nThe answer: Greg Olsen", "{1, 2, 5}\nExplanation: We need to find the number of touchdowns Cam Newton has had, which is given as 45 in the article. Therefore, the answer is 45. \nThe answer: 45", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Cam Newton's quarterback rating of 99.4 is a career-best, which means it is the highest ranking he has achieved.\nThe answer: 99.4", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to find the number of passes that Greg Olsen caught, which is a specific statistic mentioned in the article. Therefore, we can apply rule 3 to ensure that we don't confuse this with any other type of information. We can also apply rule 8 to understand that if Greg Olsen caught more passes than another receiver, then that receiver caught fewer passes than Greg Olsen. \nThe answer: 77", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: Jerricho Cotchery is a key receiver on the Panthers offense.\nThe answer: wide receiver", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the Panthers RB who scored 6 TDs in the 13 games leading up to Super Bowl 50. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the RB's name will come after the mention of other players in the offense. Rule 23 tells us that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we need to look for an active sentence to identify the RB. \nThe answer: Jonathan Stewart.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Panthers offense had six Pro Bowl selections, including quarterback Cam Newton, tight end Greg Olsen, wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr., veteran Jerricho Cotchery, rookie Devin Funchess, and guard Trai Turner. The article also lists center Ryan Kalil and running back Jonathan Stewart as Pro Bowl selections, but they are not part of the offense. Therefore, the answer is six.\nThe answer: six", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, which is a profession. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer will not include any nationality. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so we know that the quarterback is male.\nThe answer: Cam Newton", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage provides specific information about Cam Newton's passing yards in 2015, so rule 3 (size) is relevant. The question asks for a specific number, so rule 8 (comparative statements) is not relevant.\nThe answer: 3,837 yards", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Cam Newton had a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing, 10 rushing), and the question asks specifically for the number of touchdowns he had in 2015.\nThe answer: 45", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 6", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the article states that the Panthers offense \"led the NFL in scoring.\" Therefore, no other team scored more points than the Panthers. The answer is: 500.", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Cam Newton threw for 3,837 yards in the 2015 season. This information directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 3,837 yards", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 45 (35 passing, 10 rushing)", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Newton's quarterback rating is given as a \"career-best,\" indicating that it is the highest rating he has achieved in his career. Therefore, we can infer that it is higher than any of his previous ratings. The use of \"career-low\" in reference to his interceptions also suggests that his rating is particularly high. Therefore, we can use rule 2 to determine that Newton's quarterback rating is the most or highest it has ever been. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use it to determine that Newton's quarterback rating is not the least or lowest it has ever been. \n\nThe answer: 99.4", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jerricho Cotchery had 39 receptions for 485 yards during the 2015 season.\nThe answer: 39 receptions.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Panthers defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league.\" Rule 3 states that size and numbers are different concepts, so we know that \"308 points\" is the answer, not just \"308.\" Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"gave up\" is synonymous with \"surrendered,\" so we can rephrase the question as \"How many points did the Panthers defense surrender?\" \nThe answer: 308 points", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Jared Allen is a veteran defensive end who was the NFL's active career sack leader with 136.\nThe answer: 136", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luke Kuechly led the team in tackles with 118. \nThe answer: 118", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Josh Norman had four interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. This means that he intercepted four balls in total.\nThe answer: 4", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: We use rule 1 to determine that the player who registered the most sacks had more sacks than any other player on the team. We use rule 3 to determine that sacks are a different concept than interceptions or tackles. \nThe answer: Kawann Short", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"numbers are different concepts\" (rule 3) is important to note that the answer is a numerical value. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" (rule 8) is relevant because the question asks for the number of interceptions credited to the Panthers defense, which means that the answer is the same as the number of interceptions that the Panthers defense is credited with. \nThe answer: 24", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is asking for the player who had the most sacks on the Panthers defense. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about the players' physical attributes is irrelevant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first player mentioned in the passage who is identified as having the most sacks is the answer.\nThe answer: Kawann Short", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about whether being selected for the Pro Bowl is a profession or a nationality. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify the two Pro Bowl selections mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: Four", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: four", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Kurt Coleman led the team with seven interceptions, making him the player with the most interceptions for the season.\nThe answer: Kurt Coleman", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"numbers are different concepts\" does not apply because the question asks for a specific number. The rule that \"comparative adjectives have antonyms\" does not apply because the question does not involve a comparison. The answer is \"24\".\nThe answer: 24", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists the statistics of various players on the Panthers defense. Kony Ealy is mentioned as having \"5 sacks in just 9 starts.\" \nThe answer: Kony Ealy", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11. \nThe answer: Kawann Short", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 2 applies because the question asks about interceptions that were scored as touchdowns, which is a specific and extreme case of interceptions. Rule 16 applies because the question asks about a specific player's interceptions, and the passage lists interceptions for multiple players.\nThe answer: 2", "{rule list: 4, 15}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the current head coach of the Broncos, so we need to use rule 15 to determine that the previous head coach, John Fox, is not the answer. We can then use rule 4 to understand that the head coach's profession is different from their nationality or any other concept mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: Gary Kubiak", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: We need to identify the quarterback who played for the Broncos after Peyton Manning was benched. Rules 3, 5, and 6 help us understand that the quarterback is a person and not a vehicle or animal. Rule 4 helps us understand that the quarterback's nationality is not relevant to the answer. Rules 8, 20, and 21 help us understand that the quarterback's gender is not relevant to the answer. Rule 12 helps us ignore irrelevant information about coaching changes and injuries. Rule 16 helps us understand that the quarterback played after Manning was benched. The answer is Brock Osweiler. \nThe answer: Brock Osweiler", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: Peyton Manning's rookie year is mentioned as being with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, so we use rule 16 to determine that this comes before any mention of his time with the Denver Broncos. We also use rule 18 to note that the question is asking for the team he played for, not the team he currently plays for or any other information. \nThe answer: Indianapolis Colts", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage that states \"Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers.\" This sentence indicates that the Broncos played against the San Diego Chargers in the last week of the regular season.\nThe answer: San Diego Chargers", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion between the head coach and the defensive coordinator, who are both mentioned in the passage. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" ensures that we are looking for the name of the defensive coordinator.\nThe answer: Wade Phillips", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the passage, it is mentioned that John Fox was the previous head coach before Gary Kubiak was hired as the new head coach. Therefore, John Fox was the head coach of the Denver Broncos for the previous four years.\nThe answer: Four years", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach.\" Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that John Fox was the previous head coach and Gary Kubiak was hired after him. Rule 23 tells us that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we can identify \"hiring\" as the verb and \"Gary Kubiak\" as the subject. \nThe answer: Gary Kubiak", "{rule list: 19, 20}\nExplanation: The question is asking for information about Peyton Manning's past, which is not directly related to his current team or the events described in the article. Therefore, rules 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, and 24 are not relevant. The question is also not comparing two entities or concepts, so rules 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 are not relevant. The question does not involve size, shape, age, or color, so rule 3 is not relevant. The question does not involve profession or nationality comparisons, so rule 4 is not relevant. The question does not involve animals or vehicles, so rules 5 and 6 are not relevant. The question does not involve typos or contractions, so rules 10 and 11 are not relevant. The answer to the question is a simple fact about Peyton Manning's past, so his gender is irrelevant, and rules 19 and 20 apply. \nThe answer: It is not relevant to", "{rule list: 19, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can assume that \"Peyton Manning\" is a person regardless of their gender. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that \"Peyton Manning\" is the person being referred to in the article. \nThe answer: 39", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that in week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. This is a specific injury that is mentioned in the text. \nThe answer: plantar fasciitis in his left foot", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Broncos underwent coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox, and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach. This means that Kubiak replaced Fox as the head coach.\nThe answer: Gary Kubiak", "{rule list: 4, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Therefore, the question is asking for the name of the person who played the position of quarterback for the Broncos in the 2015 season. The rules also state that \"he\" refers to male names, so the answer is Peyton Manning. \nThe answer: Peyton Manning", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: plantar fasciitis in his heel", "{rule list: 19, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can assume that Manning's age is not affected by his gender. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that Manning's age is mentioned after his name.\nThe answer: 39", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of games the Broncos lost during their regular 2015 season. The passage states that the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12-4 record, which means they won 12 games and lost 4 games.\nThe answer: 4", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the coach who left the Broncos after the season prior to Super Bowl 50. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the previous season to Super Bowl 50 was the 2014-2015 season, during which John Fox was the head coach of the Broncos. Therefore, the answer is not John Fox, but rather the coach who left after him. Rule 4 applies because profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer is not \"American\" or \"Denver Broncos.\" Rule 16 applies because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer is \"John Fox.\" \n\nThe answer: John Fox.", "{1, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison between two points in time (the current season and a previous one). Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a negative comparison (worst year) and the article mentions that Manning had his worst statistical season since his rookie year. Rule 16 applies because the article mentions Manning as the quarterback for Super Bowl 50. \nThe answer: Peyton Manning", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the head coach of the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl 50. The passage mentions that the Broncos underwent coaching changes, including the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach. Therefore, Kubiak was the head coach for Super Bowl 50. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb), as they help identify the subject of the sentence and the action they are performing. \nThe answer: Gary Kubiak", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: left foot", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Wade Phillips", "{rule list: 1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: Manning's passer rating is compared to Osweiler's, indicating a comparison between the two. Therefore, we can use rule 1 to infer that if Manning had a career-low rating, then Osweiler had a higher rating. Additionally, the use of \"in contrast\" implies a comparison of opposites, which aligns with rule 8. \nThe answer: 67.9", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Manning's passer rating was lower than Osweiler's, indicating that he performed worse in terms of throwing the ball. This means that he likely threw more interceptions than Osweiler. Therefore, rule 1 applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is 17 interceptions. \nThe answer: 17 interceptions.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions. Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes. \nThe answer: Demaryius Thomas", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be determined based on physical characteristics. However, the passage mentions the team's leading rusher, which implies that there were multiple players who rushed the ball. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine that the answer is C. J. Anderson. \nThe answer: C. J. Anderson", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to find the number of touchdowns thrown by Brock Osweiler. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about them is not relevant. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that Osweiler threw more touchdowns than Manning since his passer rating and overall stats were better. Therefore, the answer is 10.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Manning's passer rating is compared to Osweiler's, indicating a comparison of two quantities. Therefore, rule 1 applies. The question asks for a specific number, so the answer should be a numerical value. Therefore, rule 8 applies.\nThe answer: 67.9", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Manning threw for 2,249 yards.\nThe answer: 2,249 yards", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Manning had 17 interceptions by the end of the year, as stated in the passage.\nThe answer: 17", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists the number of receptions for each player, and Demaryius Thomas is listed as having the most with 105. Additionally, the passage states that Thomas \"led the team\" in receptions, indicating that he had the most out of all players on the team. The passage also follows rule 16 by listing Thomas first before mentioning Emmanuel Sanders. \nThe answer: Demaryius Thomas", "{rule list: 4, 12, 20}\nExplanation: Demaryius Thomas is a veteran receiver who led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns.\nThe answer: receiver", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"numbers are different concepts\" (rule 3) means that the passer rating is a separate concept from the other statistics listed. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" (rule 8) means that since Osweiler had a higher passer rating than Manning, Manning had a lower passer rating than Osweiler. \nThe answer: 67.9", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Manning threw 17 interceptions during the 2015 season.\nThe answer: 17", "{rule list: 16, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person who led the Broncos with 105 receptions. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a name in the passage. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the name will come before the position or statistic. \nThe answer: Demaryius Thomas", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Five", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: We can use rule 1 to infer that Osweiler had a higher passer rating than Manning since it is stated that Osweiler's rating was 86.4 and Manning's was a career-low. Then, we can use rule 2 to infer that Manning had the least passer rating. \nThe answer: 67.9", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Manning had 17 interceptions in 2015, which is more than Osweiler's 6 interceptions, so according to rule 1, Osweiler had fewer interceptions than Manning. Therefore, the answer is 17.\nThe answer: 17", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that the answer we are looking for is a person's name. The rule 22 helps us understand that the former player mentioned in the passage is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Emmanuel Sanders", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage clearly states that C. J. Anderson was the team's leading rusher with 863 yards and seven touchdowns. \nThe answer: C. J. Anderson", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides statistics about the Denver Broncos' offense in 2015, including Ronnie Hillman's rushing yards and number of receptions. The question specifically asks for Hillman's average yards per carry, which is a measure of his efficiency as a runner. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Hillman's rushing yards and number of receptions are mentioned is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer can be found in the last piece of information given about Hillman's performance. \nThe answer: 4.7", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The first rule states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the Broncos' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed, which means they gave up the least amount of yards compared to all other teams. Therefore, the answer is not the number of yards they gave up, but rather the number of yards they allowed, which is 4,530. The eighth rule states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the antonym of \"allowed\" is \"gave up\", so the answer is \"4,530 yards allowed\". \nThe answer: 4,530 yards allowed", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 5\u00bd sacks", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage states that \"Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109,\" indicating that he was first on the team in total tackles.\nThe answer: Brandon Marshall", "{rule list: 2, 13}\nExplanation: Aqib Talib was one of two Pro Bowl selections from the defense, and he had three interceptions.\nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: DeMarcus Ware is a linebacker who currently plays for the Broncos.\nThe answer: linebacker", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Brandon Marshall is a linebacker, which is a position in football.\nThe answer: linebacker", "{rule list: 3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: Derek Wolfe is a defensive end for the Broncos, as stated in the article.

The answer is \"31-24\". The score at halftime was 31-0, and the Seahawks made a comeback attempt in the second half, but ultimately lost by a score of 31-24. The use of \"the game between the Panthers and the Seahawks\" clarifies that the answer is not referring to a different game. The use of contractions in the question is irrelevant to the answer.", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the team that the Carolina Panthers played immediately prior to the NFC Championship game.

The question uses the phrase \"gained in the 487,\" which is a typo and can be ignored.\nThe answer: 487", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage explicitly states that the Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round.\nThe answer: Seattle Seahawks", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the team that the Panthers played to advance to the Super Bowl, which implies that they had to win a game prior to the Super Bowl. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the divisional round game was played before the NFC Championship Game.

Therefore, irrelevant information can be disregarded.\nThe answer: The score is not given in the article.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence structure is in the active voice, with the Panthers as the subject and the Seattle Seahawks as the object. Therefore, the Panthers played the Seattle Seahawks in their division championship game.\nThe answer: Seattle Seahawks", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage only mentions the number of yards gained in the NFC Championship Game, not the divisional round. Therefore, irrelevant information must be ignored. \nThe answer: 487 yards", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round.\" The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb). \nThe answer: Pittsburgh Steelers", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.

Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the Broncos beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round before beating the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. Rule 23 tells us that passive voice can be used in a sentence, so we can rephrase the sentence \"The Broncos became the AFC champions by beating [team name]\" to \"The team that the Broncos beat to become the AFC champions was [team name].\" \nThe answer: New England Patriots", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the interception on New England's 2-point conversion attempt happened \"with 17 seconds left on the clock.\"\nThe answer: 17", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the player who was injured in the NFC Championship Game. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that Thomas Davis is the player we are looking for. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can infer that Davis did not break his own arm, but rather someone or something else caused the injury. \nThe answer: Thomas Davis", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: broken arm", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 16}\nExplanation: We need to find out how many times Thomas Davis tore his ACL in his career. This information is directly stated in the passage, which says that he had \"already overcome three ACL tears in his career.\" We can use rules 1 and 2 to understand that \"already overcome three\" means he had torn his ACL three times before. Rule 3 tells us that this is a different concept from his broken arm injury. Rule 4 tells us that his profession (football player) is different from his nationality or any other concept mentioned in the passage. Rule 5 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts and do not apply here. Rule 6 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts and do not apply here. Rule 12 tells us that we can ignore any irrelevant information in the passage. Rule 16 tells us that we should prioritize the information that comes first in the passage. \nThe answer: Three.", "{rule list: 19}\nExplanation: Thomas Davis' profession is relevant to the question, and his gender is irrelevant to his profession.\nThe answer: 11 years.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the number of times Thomas Davis suffered from a certain injury and the fact that he had already overcome it. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as injury and career. Rule 8 applies because it establishes a relationship between the injury that Thomas Davis suffered from and its antonym. \nThe answer: ACL tear", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Thomas Davis broke his arm during the NFC Championship Game.\nThe answer: arm", "{rule list: 19, 23}\nExplanation: Thomas Davis is a person and his profession is relevant to the question.

The answer is 11 years.\nThe answer: 11 years.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Super Bowl", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it provides a way to understand that overcoming three ACL tears means that Thomas Davis has had three ACL injuries. Rule 2 applies because it clarifies that \"overcoming\" means that he has had the most ACL injuries and that he has had more ACL injuries than any other player on the team. Rule 17 applies because it clarifies that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Thomas Davis [...] went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that Thomas Davis did not actively break his arm, but rather his arm was acted upon by an external force, resulting in a broken bone. Therefore, rules 16 and 23 apply.\nThe answer: Thomas Davis suffered a broken arm.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Carolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game.\" Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that \"11-year veteran\" refers to the number of years Thomas Davis had played in the league. Rule 23 tells us that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we can infer that Thomas Davis did not break his own arm. \nThe answer: 11", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence is in the active voice, with \"Thomas Davis\" as the subject and \"suffered a broken arm\" as the verb. \nThe answer: Thomas Davis", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Peyton Manning is the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39. \nThe answer: 39", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that John Elway played in a Super Bowl before Peyton Manning. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, which means that \"who\" in the question refers to a male person. Therefore, the answer is John Elway. \nThe answer: John Elway", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that John Elway played in Super Bowl XXXIII before Peyton Manning. The rule 22 establishes that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last entity, which means that John Elway is the former and Peyton Manning is the latter. \nThe answer: 38", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: John Elway's current role in the Broncos franchise is mentioned in the same sentence as his previous role as a quarterback, indicating that he is no longer a player. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so his previous profession as a quarterback does not affect his current role. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so his current role as Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager comes after his previous role as a quarterback. \nThe answer: Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that John Elway led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII, which means he played for the Broncos in that game. The sentence structure is in the active voice, with \"led\" as the verb and \"Broncos\" as the object. Therefore, we can use rules 16 and 23 to determine that the answer is: Broncos.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence states that John Elway led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII, which is in the past tense and in the active voice, indicating that he was the winning team's quarterback. Therefore, the answer is the Broncos.\nThe answer: Broncos", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that John Elway is the General Manager is not relevant to the fact that he led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that John Elway is the last person mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: John Elway", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: This rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage mentions both Peyton Manning and John Elway, but Elway is mentioned second and specifically in relation to Manning's achievement. Therefore, we can assume that Elway's Super Bowl win happened before Manning's, making Elway the \"first\" and Manning the \"last\" in this context. The passage states that Elway won Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38, so the answer is 38.\nThe answer: 38", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Peyton Manning is the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39, surpassing the previous record held by John Elway. \nThe answer: John Elway", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about multiple teams, implying a comparison between them. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the number of teams, not the specific names or characteristics of the teams. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about Manning's profession as a quarterback, not his nationality or any other characteristic. \nThe answer: two", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the number of teams Peyton Manning led to the Super Bowl, implying that he led more than one team. Therefore, the answer must be at least 2. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the number of teams, which is a different concept than the number of Super Bowls. \nThe answer: 2", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Peyton Manning is the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39, surpassing the previous record held by John Elway. \nThe answer: Peyton Manning", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that John Elway played in a Super Bowl before Peyton Manning. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, which means that \"the past record\" refers to John Elway.\nThe answer: John Elway", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Elway won Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XXXIII", "{1, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The first relevant rule is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the question asks for the first quarterback to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls, implying that there have been others who have led one team to multiple Super Bowls. Therefore, we can infer that Peyton Manning is more accomplished in this regard than any other quarterback. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which helps us identify that Manning is the subject of the question. Finally, rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, which confirms that the question is asking for a male quarterback. \nThe answer: Peyton Manning", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Peyton Manning played in Super Bowl 50 at age 39, making him the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl. \nThe answer: 39", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, John Elway led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38, so he is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: John Elway", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us understand that Manning was picked first in his draft class. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence \"Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft\" is in passive voice, meaning that Manning did not actively pick himself, but rather was picked by a team. \nThe answer: 1998", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that first comes before last. The rule 23 is relevant because it establishes that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb. Therefore, \"Newton was picked first in 2011\" is a passive sentence, and \"2011\" is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: 2011", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Manning and Newton set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days, and that Manning was 39 years old.

First comes before last.\nThe answer: 13 years and 48 days.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the player who was selected second in the 2011 NFL Draft. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from draft pick, so the fact that Manning and Newton have a large age difference is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the players are football quarterbacks is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer is not provided in the passage. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given article.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Manning was the first choice in the NFL draft of 1998. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb\", which means that the sentence \"Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft\" is in the active voice, and therefore, Manning is the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: Manning", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the question asks about a player being chosen in the NFL draft means that it is referring to their profession, not their nationality. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so the first player chosen in the NFL draft in 2011 is the one being referred to. \nThe answer: Newton", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Manning and Newton had a 13-year and 48-day age difference during Super Bowl 50, and that Manning was 39 years old at the time. Therefore, to find Newton's age, we subtract 13 years and 48 days from Manning's age. The answer is 26 years old.\nThe answer: 26", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article does not mention Newton's position explicitly, but rule 3 tells us that position is a different concept from age and draft pick. Rule 16 tells us that \"quarterback\" comes before \"position\" in terms of importance. Therefore, we can infer that Newton played quarterback during Super Bowl 50.\nThe answer: Quarterback", "{rule list: 1, 2, 16}\nExplanation: Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft, which means he was chosen first overall in that draft. Therefore, rule 1 applies to establish that he was the most selected player in that draft. Rule 2 applies to establish that he was the least selected player in any other draft. Rule 16 applies to establish that the 1998 draft came before any other draft. \nThe answer: 1998 NFL draft", "{rule list: 1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The question asks for the draft in which Newton was the number one pick, which is a specific piece of information. Rules 1 and 3 are relevant because they establish that comparisons of size, shape, age, and color are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that profession and nationality are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: 2011", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that the Super Bowl matchup pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other, with Newton being the first pick. Therefore, the answer must be the second pick of the 2011 draft. \nThe answer: There is no information in the article about the identity of the second pick in the 2011 draft.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that Newton was picked first in the 2011 NFL draft.\nThe answer: 2011", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Manning was 39 years old and Newton was 26 years old, and that they had a 13-year and 48-day age difference. Therefore, we can infer that Newton was born 13 years and 48 days after Manning. To find Newton's age in Super Bowl 50, we need to subtract his birth year from the year of Super Bowl 50 (2016). Since the article does not provide their birth years, we cannot calculate their exact ages. However, we can use the given information to determine that Newton was in his late 20s during Super Bowl 50.\nThe answer: late 20s", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to find the age difference between Newton and Manning. The article states that Manning was 39 and Newton was 26 during Super Bowl 50, so we subtract 26 from 39 to get the age difference. \nThe answer: 13 years and 48 days", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rivera is the subject of the sentence and played in a past Super Bowl, indicating a passive construction. The rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps identify that the Super Bowl number should come after the mention of Rivera. The rule of \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps identify that the verb \"play\" is in the past participle form, indicating a passive construction. \nThe answer: Super Bowl XX", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rivera played for the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, which is mentioned in the sentence. This is a straightforward question that only requires identifying the team mentioned in the sentence.\nThe answer: Chicago Bears", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about Rivera's position in comparison to the other players in Super Bowl XX. Rule 16 applies because the article mentions Rivera's participation in Super Bowl XX. \nThe answer: linebacker", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Super Bowl XXIV came after Super Bowl XXI. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, which means that \"he\" in the question refers to Elway, who was replaced by Kubiak. \nThe answer: Elway", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Super Bowl XXI happened before Kubiak replaced Elway in the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV. Therefore, Kubiak did not play for the Broncos in Super Bowl XXI. Rule 20 establishes that \"he\" refers to male names, so we know that Kubiak is male. \nThe answer: Chicago Bears", "{1, 16, 20}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about Rivera's position in comparison to the other players in Super Bowl XX. Rule 16 applies because the question asks specifically about Rivera's position, which is a characteristic that can be compared to other players. Rule 20 applies because the question uses the pronoun \"he\" to refer to Rivera, indicating that Rivera is male. \nThe answer: linebacker", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Elway played in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV before Kubiak took his place. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that Kubiak replaced Elway, making it a passive sentence. \nThe answer: Elway", "{rule list: 16, 21}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the head coach for the 2015 season of the Panthers. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the head coach's name will likely come before or after the information given in the context. Rule 21 tells us that \"his\" refers to male names and \"her\" refers to female names, which can help us determine the gender of the head coach. \nThe answer: The article does not provide the name of the Panthers head coach for the 2015 season.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rivera was a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XX.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific event that happened on the Levi's Stadium turf during a specific week of the 2015 NFL season. The relevant information is that \"during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal.\" The sentence is in the passive voice, so we need to identify the subject (the turf) and the object (Justin Tucker). The negation in the question (\"who slipped\") is important, as it implies that the answer is a person who slipped, not just someone who played on the field. Therefore, the answer is Justin Tucker. \nThe answer: Justin Tucker", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the name of the turf used in Levi's Stadium for the Super Bowl. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse the concept of the turf with any other concept. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the article mentions that the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, but the NFL re-sodded the field with a new playing surface; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. The answer is Bermuda 419. \nThe answer: Bermuda 419", "{rule list: 4, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 13 (names are equally important for the answer), 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The question asks for the field director of the NFL, so we need to look for a person who holds that position. The passage mentions Ed Mangan as the NFL and Atlanta Braves field director, so he is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: Ed Mangan", "{rule list: 16, 17, 22}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the information about Justin Tucker's team should come before any other information about the game. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the team Tucker played for, not the team he was playing against. Finally, rule 22 establishes that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last, but since there are only two entities mentioned in the passage (the field and the NFL), this rule is not directly relevant. \nThe answer: Baltimore Ravens", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that Justin Tucker was acted upon by the collapsing turf. Therefore, he was not playing a position, but rather attempting a field goal.\nThe answer: N/A (the question is based on a misunderstanding of the passage)", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal. Therefore, the answer is Justin Tucker.\nThe answer: Justin Tucker", "{rule list: 3, 7, 10, 12, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that \"during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal.\" This indicates that Tucker is a kicker for the Baltimore Ravens.\nThe answer: Kicker", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for what was used to sod the Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl 50, which is a specific detail mentioned in the article. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about those concepts is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article mentions that a certain type of sod was used, then it implies that other types of sod were not used. \nThe answer: a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf.", "{1, 3, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the kicker who missed a field goal due to a portion of the turf collapsing. Rule 1 tells us that if one field is of higher quality than another, the lower quality field is of lower quality than the higher quality field. Rule 3 tells us that the quality of the field is a different concept than the identity of the kicker. Rule 8 tells us that if one event causes another event, the absence of the first event would result in the absence of the second event. Rule 12 tells us that irrelevant information should be ignored. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Justin Tucker", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding that the question is asking about a specific event (the Super Bowl) and what was done to the playing field before it. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the quality of the field and what was done to it. Rule 8 is relevant because it helps to understand that the NFL's actions were in response to concerns about the field's quality. \nThe answer: re-sodded the field with a new playing surface", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the field at Levi's Stadium was re-sodded with a new playing surface, specifically a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf. The irrelevant information about concerns and issues with the field in the past and during the game can be ignored.\nThe answer: a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify what players had to change during Super Bowl 50 due to the condition of the field. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as potential answers. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if players did not need to change something due to the condition of the field, then that is not the answer. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative statements in the passage. The answer: their cleats.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Justin Tucker", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the type of field usually chosen for Super Bowl games. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the passage. The passage states that it is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums to have the field re-sodded with a new playing surface, which implies that natural grass is the usual choice for Super Bowl games. Therefore, the answer is natural grass. \nThe answer: natural grass", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Broncos were designated as the home team in the Super Bowl.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: We can use rule 16 to determine that Super Bowl XXXIII was the last game that John Elway played as Denver QB. However, this information is not relevant to the question. Instead, we can focus on the sentence that states \"when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-19.\" This gives us the answer.\nThe answer: 34-19", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that in Super Bowl XXXIII, the Broncos wore matching white jerseys and pants and defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-19. Therefore, the team that lost Super Bowl XXXIII is the Atlanta Falcons.\nThe answer: Atlanta Falcons", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the color of the pants worn by the Broncos in Super Bowl 50. The relevant rules are 3 and 8, which state that color is a different concept and that if A wore X but B wore Y, then the answer is Y. \nThe answer: white", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Elway's last game as Denver QB, which was Super Bowl XXXIII.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XXXIII", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Elway's last game as Denver QB was in Super Bowl XXXIII, where they wore matching white jerseys and pants and defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-19.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XXXIII", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in Super Bowl XXXIII, the Broncos wore their matching white jerseys and pants and defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-19. \nThe answer: 34-19", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the team that the Denver Broncos played in Super Bowl XXXIII, which is a specific event in the past. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that Super Bowl XXXIII happened before the current time. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" which means that the answer will likely be in the active voice. \nThe answer: Atlanta Falcons", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants, as they have had Super Bowl success in their white uniforms. Therefore, the answer is white.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions the Broncos' success in their white uniforms and their lack of success in orange jerseys. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about the jersey, which is a different concept than the pants. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the specific year and not for any other Super Bowl. \nThe answer: white jerseys", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the only other team in the AFC to wear road jerseys, implying that the Broncos have also done so. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for the team's affiliation with the AFC. \nThe answer: Pittsburgh Steelers", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The first relevant rule is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the passage states that the Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII. Therefore, we can infer that they have not worn white uniforms in any Super Bowl since then. The second relevant rule is rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. In this case, Super Bowl XXXIII came after Super Bowl XXXII, so the answer is Super Bowl XXXIII.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XXXIII", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color at the time. Elway was the quarterback during this game.\nThe answer: blue", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that color is a different concept applies, as well as the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer: orange jerseys.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if Denver chose to wear white, then Carolina wore a color other than white. Rule 3 applies because color is a different concept from team designation or uniform choice.\nThe answer: black jerseys with silver pants", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility\", indicating that the Panthers practiced at San Jose State.\nThe answer: San Jose State", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the first team mentioned is the Panthers, who used the San Jose State practice facility, and the last team mentioned is the Broncos, who practiced at Stanford University. Therefore, the Broncos practiced at Stanford University.\nThe answer: Stanford University", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that the Panthers stayed at the San Jose Marriott. Rule 3 applies because the size, shape, age, and color of the facilities are different concepts and rule 12 applies because the information about the Broncos is irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: San Jose", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the locations where the Panthers and Broncos stayed during a certain event. The question specifically asks for the city's Marriott where the Broncos stayed. Rule 16 applies to determine that \"last comes after first,\" so the information about the Broncos comes after the information about the Panthers. Rule 23 applies to identify that the sentence is in the active voice, so the Broncos stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.\nThe answer: Santa Clara", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Panthers stayed at the San Jose Marriott.\nThe answer: San Jose Marriott.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 13 (names are equally important for the answer). The question asks for the name of the hotel the Panthers chose to stay in during Super Bowl 50, and the answer is \"San Jose Marriott.\"", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 applies because \"Panthers\" comes before \"Broncos\" in the sentence. The rule 22 applies because \"former\" refers to the first entity listed, which is the San Jose State practice facility.\nThe answer: San Jose State practice facility.", "{rule list: 14, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Broncos practiced at Stanford University and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.\" This indicates that the Broncos practiced at Stanford University.\nThe answer: Stanford University.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility\", indicating that the Panthers practiced at the San Jose State practice facility.\nThe answer: San Jose State practice facility", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the first entity mentioned in the sentence is the Panthers and the second is the Broncos. Rule 22 establishes that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, which means that the former (Panthers) stayed at the San Jose Marriott. \nThe answer: San Jose Marriott", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the location where the Broncos practiced for the Super Bowl. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the location mentioned last in the passage is where the Broncos practiced. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. In this case, \"practiced\" is the verb and \"the Broncos\" is the subject, so the sentence is in the passive voice. Therefore, the answer is: Stanford University.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the hotel used by the Broncos for Super Bowl 50. The passage states that the Broncos stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott. This is a simple question of identifying the subject (Broncos) and the relevant information (hotel used). The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (passive voice). \nThe answer: Santa Clara Marriott.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility.\" This indicates that the practice place used by the Panthers was located at the San Jose State facility.\nThe answer: San Jose State practice facility", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott.\" This indicates that the Panthers stayed at the San Jose Marriott.\nThe answer: San Jose Marriott", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the Broncos are mentioned after the Panthers, so their location (Stanford University) comes after the location of the Panthers (San Jose State practice facility). \nThe answer: Stanford University", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is relevant because the question is asking about where a sports team stayed, not their nationality. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is also relevant because the question is asking specifically about the Broncos. \nThe answer: Santa Clara Marriott.", "{1, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that \"temporarily suspended\" means that the practice will be reinstated later. Rule 10 is relevant because typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a negation (\"suspension\") and therefore the answer is \"June 4, 2014\". \nThe answer: June 4, 2014.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the Super Bowl where the practice of branding with Roman numerals was established. This information is given in the article as Super Bowl V. \nThe answer: Super Bowl V", "{14, 19}\nExplanation: The person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, and names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Jaime Weston", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. This means that Super Bowl XLV was the first to use the standardized logo template.\nThe answer: Super Bowl XLV", "{rule list: names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The trophy featured on the logo is named after Vince Lombardi.\nThe answer: Vince Lombardi", "{1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the year when Roman numerals were not used, which implies that they were used in other years. Rule 2 applies because the question uses \"declared\" instead of \"used\" which implies that the decision was made beforehand. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the year when Roman numerals were not used, which implies that Arabic numerals were used instead.\nThe answer: 2016", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes the relationship between the 50th Super Bowl and the subsequent ones. Rule 16 applies because it establishes the order of Super Bowls. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"after\"). \nThe answer: Super Bowl LI", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The rules selected cover comparisons, synonyms, irrelevant information, names, locations, negations, and sentence structure. They allow us to determine that the 50th Super Bowl would have been named \"Super Bowl L.\" \nThe answer: L", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The color of the numbers is mentioned in the passage and is not related to size, shape, age, or profession. Contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: gold", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: June 4, 2014", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the NFL temporarily suspended the practice of using Roman numerals and instead used Arabic numerals for Super Bowl 50. Rule 3 applies because Roman numerals and Arabic numerals are different concepts. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the opposite of \"Roman numerals.\" \nThe answer: Arabic numerals", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Super Bowl was previously branded with Roman numerals is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer is \"There is no Roman numeral for 50.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size and shape, so it is important to note that the color of the number is being asked. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the standard logo has silver numerals and the Super Bowl 50 logo has gold numerals, then the answer is \"gold\". \nThe answer: gold", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI, which means that they will be used again to denote the Super Bowl number.\nThe answer: Super Bowl LI", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the NFL temporarily suspended the practice of using Roman numerals to brand Super Bowl games and used Arabic numerals for Super Bowl 50 instead. Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI. \nThe answer: Arabic numerals", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI, which is 51 in Arabic numerals. The fact that Super Bowl LI is referred to as \"LI\" in Roman numerals implies that it is 51. The rule 2 applies because \"LI\" is a Roman numeral and \"51\" is an Arabic numeral, and rule 8 applies because \"LI\" is more Roman than \"51\". \nThe answer: LI", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"color is a different concept\" is relevant because it establishes that color is not interchangeable with other concepts such as shape or size. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because it allows us to infer that if gold was featured in the promotions, then other colors were not as prominent.\nThe answer: gold", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Week 7", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is relevant because it clarifies that the answer is not referring to a physical object, but rather a specific marking on the field. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A is relevant because it allows us to understand that the answer is referring to the 50-yard line, which is the only yard marker on the field that is not painted gold. \nThe answer: 50-yard line", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"color is a different concept\" is relevant because it establishes that color is not interchangeable with other concepts such as shape or size. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because it allows us to infer that if the 50-yard line was colored gold, then it was not colored with any other color. \nThe answer: gold", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The question asks for the color of the footballs handed out to high schools, which is directly stated in the passage as \"gold footballs.\" Rule 3 is relevant to ensure that \"gold\" is not confused with a different concept such as shape or size. Rule 10 is relevant to ignore any typos in the question. \nThe answer: Gold", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions various gold-themed promotions and initiatives held throughout the 2015 NFL season to tie into the \"Golden Super Bowl\". \nThe answer: Super Bowl 50 was known as the \"Golden Super Bowl\".", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Gold footballs were given to each high school that has had a player or coach appear in the Super Bowl.\" This means that gold footballs were given to high schools where former students went on to play or coach in a Super Bowl.\nThe answer: Gold footballs", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it clarifies that the question is asking about a specific color, not a specific yard line. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because it allows us to infer that all other yard lines were not gold. \nThe answer: 50-yard line", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the theme color of the Super Bowl, which is stated in the article as \"gold\". Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that color is a distinct concept from other characteristics. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which helps to understand that \"gold\" is the antonym of \"not gold\" and therefore the answer to the question. \nThe answer: gold", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The first mention of the Moscone Center is in reference to the NFL Experience, so it is the most relevant location to the question. Additionally, the sentence structure implies that the NFL Experience and Super Bowl City are two separate events, so it is important to specify which one is being referred to. \nThe answer: Moscone Center", "{rule list: 13, 14}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.\nThe answer: San Francisco", "{16, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the mayor of San Francisco. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the first mention of a name in the article is likely to be the answer. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" or any other negation. The answer is Ed Lee.", "{rule list: 4, 12, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name and title of a person in a specific location. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer will not be a profession. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about the NFL Experience and Super Bowl City. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the city supervisor. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the city supervisor's name will come before their title. \nThe answer: Jane Kim", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Super Bowl City\" opened on January 30. This is a specific date and therefore the rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies. Additionally, the question asks for a specific date, which is related to the concept of time, and therefore the rule of \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" does not apply.\nThe answer: January 30", "{3, 7, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific details about the games and activities are irrelevant. The passage mentions \"More than 1 million people are expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl Week,\" which answers the question.\nThe answer: More than 1 million people.", "{16, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the mayor of San Francisco during Super Bowl 50. Therefore, we need to identify the relevant information in the article that mentions the mayor's name and the event. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first. The answer is Ed Lee. \nThe answer: Ed Lee", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Moscone Center", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The passage mentions an event called \"Super Bowl City\" that was held at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero to showcase the Bay Area's technology, culinary creations, and cultural diversity.\nThe answer: Super Bowl City", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The location of the NFL Experience is mentioned in the first sentence of the article. The negation in the question (\"for the 2015 season\") is important to note, as the article does not specify which year's NFL Experience is being referred to.\nThe answer: Moscone Center in San Francisco.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Super Bowl City\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Ed Lee", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"Super Bowl City\" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza. \nThe answer: \"Super Bowl City\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: More than 1 million (exact number not given)", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area 'they are going to have to leave'.\" This is an active sentence where the subject (Ed Lee) acts the verb (said). \nThe answer: Ed Lee", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of money San Francisco received for providing services for the Super Bowl, but the passage only mentions a request by city supervisor Jane Kim for the NFL to reimburse the city for $5 million. The use of the word \"unsuccessfully\" indicates that this request was not granted. Therefore, the answer is $0.\nThe answer: $0", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the annual NFL Experience", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Santa Clara University", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of money being spent on \"other ancillary events\" related to the Super Bowl. This means that the amount of money spent on the Super Bowl itself is not relevant to the answer. Rule 3 states that size and amount are different concepts, so we can assume that \"worth\" refers to the amount of money being spent. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use the fact that \"2 million\" is a smaller amount than any amount greater than 2 million. Therefore, we can simply answer: $2 million. \nThe answer: $2 million.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a week-long event", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article mentions \"ancillary events\" worth $2 million, which includes a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally. The question asks for the amount spent on \"other festivities\", which can be interpreted as the ancillary events mentioned in the article. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply, as they state that size and synonyms are important for the answer. \nThe answer: $2 million", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a \"pep rally\" as one of the ancillary events. \"Pep rally\" is a synonym for a rally that is typically held to boost morale or enthusiasm, often in support of a sports team. \nThe answer: pep rally", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, but government entity is relevant to the answer. First comes before last and last comes after first, so the city council is the government entity referred to in the passage. \nThe answer: city council", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a beer, wine and food festival held at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University.\nThe answer: Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to a \"professional fundraiser\" who will aid in finding business sponsors and individual donors. This is an example of rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer. The use of \"still may need the city council to help fund the event\" implies that the professional fundraiser alone may not be enough to cover the cost. \nThe answer: A professional fundraiser", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who provided funding for the week-long event leading up to the Super Bowl. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a profession. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a specific entity mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: the city council", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are \"$2 million worth of other ancillary events.\" This indicates that the cost of the other Super Bowl events in the San Francisco area was $2 million.\nThe answer: $2 million", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about who may have been called upon to fund the festival associated with the Super Bowl in Santa Clara. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is important to note that the question is not asking about a specific profession. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so it is important to note that the question is asking about who may have been called upon, which implies that there may be multiple sources of funding. \nThe answer: business sponsors and individual donors, and possibly the city council", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the specific day on which Super Bowl Opening Night was held. Rule 17 reminds us that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. Rule 22 tells us that if two entities are listed, \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last. In this case, the passage lists two days: Tuesday and Monday. \"Typically,\" the media day was held on Tuesday, but it was moved to Monday and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night. Therefore, the answer is Monday, specifically February 1, 2016. \n\nThe answer: February 1, 2016", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies here, as the article states that the Super Bowl media day was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game. \nThe answer: Tuesday", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the venue that hosted Super Bowl Opening Night. The passage states that the event was held at SAP Center in San Jose. \nThe answer: SAP Center in San Jose.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: San Jose", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Golden Gate Bridge", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the traditional Media Day was typically held on Tuesday afternoon prior to the game. This means that it was not held on any other day of the week. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. \nThe answer: Tuesday", "{rule list: 10, 11}\nExplanation: Contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so \"Super Bowl 50\" is equivalent to \"Super Bowl Fifty\". The answer is Monday evening.\nThe answer: Monday evening", "{rule list: 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the \"game's media day\" was \"re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night.\" The question asks for the name of the Media Day event, so we can infer that the original name was not Super Bowl Opening Night. The use of the word \"typical\" also suggests that there was a previous name for the event. The question also uses the word \"name,\" which implies that it is looking for a specific title or label. Therefore, rules 12 and 17 are relevant, as they emphasize the importance of focusing on the specific wording of the question and disregarding irrelevant information. \nThe answer: Super Bowl Media Day (prior to being re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night)", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the media event for Super Bowl 50 was held at SAP Center in San Jose.\nThe answer: SAP Center", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the city where the media event was held for Super Bowl 50. The relevant information is that the event was held at SAP Center in San Jose. Rule 14 states that locations are equally important for the answer, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer (in this case, there are no negations). \nThe answer: San Jose.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the question is asking about when the game's media day is usually held, implying that it is a recurring event. Therefore, we can assume that the \"usual\" time refers to the standard time in relation to other events surrounding the Super Bowl. The passage states that the media day was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, which implies that this is the usual time. \nThe answer: Tuesday afternoon prior to the game.", "{rule list: 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the media day was \"re-branded\" as Super Bowl Opening Night, indicating a change in name. The use of the word \"re-branded\" implies a deliberate and intentional change. The negation in the question (\"new name\") is important to note, as it indicates that the answer should be a different name than the original \"media day.\" \nThe answer: Super Bowl Opening Night", "{1, 14}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if a comparison is made between two entities, the opposite comparison can also be made. Rule 14 is relevant because it establishes that the location of an event is important for answering a question about it. \nThe answer: SAP Center in San Jose.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that player introductions were held on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge during Super Bowl Opening Night. This means that the answer is \"Golden Gate Bridge\". \nThe answer: Golden Gate Bridge", "{1, 10}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two things. Rule 10 applies because the question contains a specific date that is mentioned in the context. \nThe answer: Monday evening, February 1, 2016.", "{rule list: 11, 13}\nExplanation: Contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer, and names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Super Bowl Opening Night.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that the media day was moved to Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night, and that the event was held on February 1, 2016 at SAP Center in San Jose. Therefore, the answer is: SAP Center in San Jose.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Golden Gate Bridge", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: February 1, 2016", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a program that provides contracting work to local companies. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers that mention a profession or nationality. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"program\" and \"contracting work.\" The answer is \"Business Connect.\" \nThe answer: Business Connect", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the article, which states that the host committee has already raised over $40 million.\nThe answer: over $40 million", "{rule list: 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a company that is a sponsor of the Super Bowl. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Dignity Health is a health company is relevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"health company\" can be considered a synonym for \"healthcare company\". Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that Dignity Health is specifically mentioned in the article is relevant.\nThe answer: Dignity Health", "{rule list: profession and company are different concepts, names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question asks for a clothing company that was a Super Bowl sponsor. The passage mentions Gap as one of the sponsors, which is a clothing company.\nThe answer: Gap", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that the mention of a petroleum company does not necessarily indicate its nationality. The rule that names are equally important for the answer means that we need to look for the name of the petroleum company. \nThe answer: Chevron", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for the committee that made an effort to invite companies owned by people who are transgender or gay, so we can infer that the answer is the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL, as they openly sought businesses owned by disabled veterans and the LGBTQ+ community. Therefore, the answer is the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL.", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the amount of money raised is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the list of sponsors. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to note that the question is asking for the amount of money raised, not the amount of money not raised. \nThe answer: over $40 million", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks about how the committee raised the money, which is a different concept from the Super Bowl program that provides contracting opportunities. Therefore, rule 4 applies to differentiate between profession and program. Rule 7 applies to identify that \"raised\" is a synonym for \"sought.\" \nThe answer: through sponsors including Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Intel, Gap, Chevron, and Dignity Health.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Business Connect", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the program that provides local businesses with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the businesses are local is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"program\" can be replaced with \"service\" in the question. The answer is Business Connect. \n\nThe answer: Business Connect", "{rule list: 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific amount of money raised by the Host Committee, which is directly stated in the passage.\nThe answer: over $40 million", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the percentage of money raised by the Host Committee that will be used for charitable causes. The answer is given directly in the passage as \"25 percent\". Rule 2 applies because \"25 percent\" is a specific amount and can be considered \"most\" in comparison to other possible percentages. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"will\" which indicates a positive statement, and therefore the negation of the statement is important for the answer. \nThe answer: 25 percent", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The name of the charitable initiative is \"50 fund\". The answer is \"50 fund\".", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they establish the relationship between the percentage of funds raised and the percentage of funds given to charitable causes. Rule 17 is relevant because the question specifically asks for the percentage of funds given to charitable causes. \nThe answer: 25%", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a fund created by the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee for philanthropic initiatives. \nThe answer: 50 fund", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question contains the word \"ever\", which implies a comparison to previous Super Bowls. Therefore, rules 17 and 18, which deal with negations in the question, are relevant to ensure that the answer is not a simple repetition of the statement in the article.\nThe answer: the most giving Super Bowl ever", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"25 percent\" implies that the remaining 75 percent is not being dedicated to local charities. Rule 3 applies because \"money\" and \"percent\" are different concepts. \nThe answer: 25 percent", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a fund that focuses on youth development, community investment, and sustainable environments. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"name\" are different from concepts such as \"youth development\" or \"sustainable environments.\" Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which is relevant because the question uses the phrase \"youth, community, and sustainable environments\" which is a synonym for \"youth development, community investment, and sustainable environments\" mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: 50 fund", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the percentage of money raised that was dedicated to philanthropic causes in the Bay Area, which is a specific location. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is: 25 percent.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the philanthropic initiative created by the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee to provide grants for youth development, community investment, and sustainable environments. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"name\" are different from concepts such as \"youth development\" or \"sustainable environments\". Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which means that the name of the initiative is not related to the profession or nationality of the committee members. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: 50 fund", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the trophy given to the Super Bowl champion, which is named after Vince Lombardi. This falls under rule 3, as the name of the trophy is a different concept than its size, shape, age, or color. It also falls under rule 4, as the name is related to a profession (Lombardi was a football coach) rather than a nationality. \nThe answer: Vince Lombardi", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage: \"the winner of Super Bowl 50 will also receive a large, 18-karat gold-plated '50'.\" \nThe answer: 18", "{3}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the weight of the \"50\" given to the Super Bowl winner. The answer is \"66 lb (30 kg).\"", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the designer of the \"50\", which is a specific item mentioned in the article. Therefore, rule 13 (names are equally important for the answer) is relevant. Additionally, the article states that the \"50\" will be designed by Tiffany & Co., which is a company and therefore falls under the category of profession (rule 4). \nThe answer: Tiffany & Co.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that the designer of the Vince Lombardi Trophy is not relevant to the answer. The rule that names are equally important for the answer means that the answer must specify the name of the designer.\nThe answer: Tiffany & Co.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the trophy given to anyone who plays on the winning team in a Super Bowl. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the trophy is described as \"large, 18-karat gold-plated '50'\" is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the players are professional football players and the trophy is given for winning the Super Bowl is not relevant to the answer. The answer is simply the Vince Lombardi Trophy. \n\nThe answer: Vince Lombardi Trophy", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be \"large\". The rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the answer cannot be \"plated\". Therefore, the answer is \"18-karat gold\". \n\nThe answer: 18-karat gold", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the designer of the \"50\". The passage states that the \"50\" will be designed by Tiffany & Co. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as objects and people. Rule 13 applies because names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Tiffany & Co.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the trophy that all Super Bowl winners receive. Rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and rule 13 states that \"names are equally important for the answer.\" Therefore, the answer is \"Vince Lombardi Trophy.\" \nThe answer: Vince Lombardi Trophy", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer. The answer is Tiffany & Co.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the television station that aired the game in the United States, which is a different concept from the broadcast team or any specific features introduced during the telecast. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply. \nThe answer: CBS", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer should not include any nationality. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer should include the name in the correct order.\nThe answer: Phil Simms", "{4, 12}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that the answer will not be a profession. The rule that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer tells us that we can ignore the information about CBS introducing new features. The answer: Tracy Wolfson.", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of cameras is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so any misspelling or typo in the question does not affect the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. \nThe answer: 36 (EyeVision 360 utilized an array of 36 cameras)", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the resolution being a size or shape. The rule that \"typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer\" allows us to ignore any potential typos in the question. \nThe answer: 5K resolution.", "{rule list: 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about the number of principal partners for broadcasting NFL events, which implies that there are multiple partners. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the partners are TV networks and not individuals is irrelevant. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the details about the specific features introduced by CBS are not necessary. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. Therefore, the answer is: Not specified/mentioned.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the sidelines", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the degree of view provided by the new cameras introduced during the Super Bowl. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these aspects of the cameras is irrelevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the cameras provide a 360-degree view, then any answer stating a degree less than 360 would be incorrect. \nThe answer: 360-degree view", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that for Super Bowl 50, the cameras were upgraded to 5K resolution, which is a specific detail relevant to the question.\nThe answer: 5K", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The location of Evan Washburn is mentioned in the context as being on the sidelines, which is a relevant location for a sideline reporter during a football game. \nThe answer: on the sidelines", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the television network that aired the Super Bowl, which is a profession-related concept. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the nationality of the network. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question uses the word \"which\" instead of \"who\". This indicates that the answer should be a thing (in this case, a network) rather than a person. \nThe answer: CBS", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer\" (12) is relevant because the information about the EyeVision cameras is not necessary to answer the question. \nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that names are equally important for the answer is relevant, as the question asks for a specific network. Therefore, we use rule 13 to extract the answer.\nThe answer: CBS", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the announcers is irrelevant. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer should include both names in the correct order.\nThe answer: Jim Nantz and Phil Simms", "{4, 12, 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: We need to identify the names of the sideline announcers for Super Bowl 50. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the announcers' nationalities. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about CBS introducing new features during the telecast. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first name mentioned is the first sideline announcer and the second name mentioned is the second sideline announcer. Rules 20 and 21 tell us that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, and \"his\" refers to male names and \"her\" refers to female names. Therefore, we can identify Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn as the Super Bowl 50 sideline announcers. \nThe answer: Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The question asks for the resolution of the Eyevision cameras, which is a specific technical detail mentioned in the article.

Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so they are not relevant. Names are equally important for the answer, so it is relevant. The answer: ESPN Deportes.", "{rule list: 20, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who reported on the sideline for ESPN Deportes, which is a specific entity. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we can determine the gender of the person. Rule 23 states that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we need to look for an active sentence to find the answer. \nThe answer: John Sutcliffe", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13, 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the person who provided Spanish-language commentary alongside Raul Allegre.

Additionally, the article specifies that the game was called by ESPN Deportes' Monday Night Football commentary crew, which suggests that the broadcast was in Spanish.\nThe answer: Spanish", "{3, 4, 7, 13, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Names are equally important for the answer, so it is relevant. First comes before last and last comes after first, so it is relevant.\nThe answer: ESPN Deportes", "{rule list: 4, 8, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the entity that exclusively broadcast the game in Spanish after reaching an agreement with the NFL and CBS. This requires understanding that \"ESPN Deportes\" is a separate entity from CBS and that the question is asking for the broadcaster in Spanish. The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A), 13 (names are equally important for the answer), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: ESPN Deportes", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of the person who served as the sideline reporter for ESPN Deportes during the Super Bowl broadcast. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 20 specifies that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. Therefore, we need to look for a name that is likely to belong to a male. \nThe answer: John Sutcliffe", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the agency that broadcasted the Spanish version of the Super Bowl. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so \"agency\" and \"nationality\" are not interchangeable. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so \"broadcasted\" and \"did not broadcast\" are antonyms. Therefore, the answer is ESPN Deportes. \nThe answer: ESPN Deportes", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if one group is mentioned in relation to another group, the opposite is also true. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the question is asking for the names of the commentators, not their nationality. Rule 13 is relevant because it establishes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: John Sutcliffe", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Basing on rule 4, profession and nationality are different concepts, and on rule 17, negations are important for the answer.

Therefore, the answer is: NFL Mobile service.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the ESPN Deportes Spanish broadcast was made available through WatchESPN, indicating that it was available for streaming on that service.\nThe answer: WatchESPN", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the website that provided a stream, which is not mentioned in the article. However, it is stated that CBS provided digital streams via CBSSports.com, which is a website. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that CBSSports.com is a website is relevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"website\" can be inferred from \"digital streams.\" \nThe answer: CBSSports.com", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer). The passage mentions that the CBS Sports app was available on \"tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku)\", so the answer is Xbox One. \nThe answer: Xbox One.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the CBS Sports app was available on \"Windows 10\", which is a specific version of the Windows operating system.\nThe answer: Windows 10", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article does not provide the domain name of the site that streamed the Super Bowl 50 game. Therefore, we can use rule 13 to eliminate it as a factor in the answer. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we can infer that the article does not provide any information about the domain name. \nThe answer: N/A", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 and 7 because they state that different concepts (such as devices and broadcasting platforms) should not be confused, and that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The answer is Xbox One. \nThe answer: Xbox One.", "{7, 18}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that \"streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers.\" This is a negation, which is important to note according to rule 18. The answer is Verizon Wireless customers.", "{7, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the app used to watch the game on smartphones. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"app\" can be replaced with \"digital media player.\" Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to note that streaming on smartphones was NOT provided to non-Verizon Wireless customers. Therefore, the answer is NFL Mobile service.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.\" Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts, in this case, the concept of a wireless company and the concept of streaming rights. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the negation of a statement, specifically, which company had exclusive rights, implying that other companies did not have those rights. \nThe answer: Verizon Communications", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.\" Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is important in understanding that Verizon is a mobile service provider, not a profession. Rule 7 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of synonyms in the question, as \"watch\" and \"stream\" are interchangeable in this context. Rule 17 is relevant because it highlights the importance of negations in the question, as the answer is specifically limited to Verizon customers. \nThe answer: NFL Mobile service", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for what CBS provided of the Super Bowl 50 broadcast for its website, some apps and media players. The answer can be found in the article where it states that \"CBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku).\" Therefore, the answer is \"digital streams of the game.\"", "{4, 18}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Due to Verizon Communications exclusivity, streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.\" Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, and in this case, the question is asking about a cellular carrier, which is a profession. Rule 18 applies because the question contains a negation (\"only\"), which is important for determining the correct answer. \nThe answer: Verizon Wireless", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph.\" The question asks where the Spanish broadcast of the game was available, and \"WatchESPN\" is mentioned in the context as a streaming service. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Spanish broadcast was available on WatchESPN. \nThe answer: WatchESPN", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the talk show that followed immediately after Super Bowl 50 on CBS. This implies that the answer should be in the immediate chronological order after the Super Bowl. Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that the first talk show to air after the Super Bowl was The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Additionally, we can use rule 23 to note that the sentence is written in the active voice, meaning that the subject (CBS) acted upon the verb (broadcast). \nThe answer: The Late Show with Stephen Colbert", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the show that aired on CBS after late local programming. This implies that the show aired after a certain time, which is indicated by the use of \"late\" in the question. Additionally, the question is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject (the show) is being acted upon by the verb (aired). Therefore, rules 16 and 23 are relevant. \nThe answer: A special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game.

This means that The Late Late Show with James Corden played after The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\nThe answer: The Late Late Show with James Corden", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: CBS is a television network and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden are both late night talk shows. The question asks for the show that followed the Super Bowl, which implies that it was broadcast after the game ended, making it the lead-out program. Therefore, the relevant rule is that the latter comes after the former. \nThe answer: The Late Show with Stephen Colbert followed by The Late Late Show with James Corden.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that CBS broadcast special episodes of its late night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game. Therefore, the answer is \"nothing\" or \"there was a break for late local programming\" (since the next show mentioned is The Late Late Show with James Corden). \nThe answer: a break for late local programming", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that CBS aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden after a break for late local programming, following a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that aired as the lead-out program for Super Bowl 50. Therefore, the answer is a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden. \nThe answer: a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden", "{1, 7, 10, 11, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the base rate to previous prices. Rule 7 applies because the question asks for the specific value of the base rate. Rules 10 and 11 apply because contractions and typos are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a specific value, not a person or location. \nThe answer: $5,000,000", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. Rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first, is relevant because it helps us identify that the beer manufacturer being referred to is Anheuser-Busch InBev. Therefore, the answer is Anheuser-Busch InBev.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Doritos", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the anniversary of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise that was celebrated during the Super Bowl. The relevant information is that Nintendo and The Pok\u00e9mon Company made their Super Bowl debut, promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pok\u00e9mon video game and media franchise. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so we need to pay attention to the specific wording of the question. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to extract the specific information about the anniversary. \nThe answer: 20th anniversary", "{1, 7, 10, 11, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the $5,000,000 base rate is a record high price. Rule 7 applies because the question uses the synonym \"starting cost\" instead of \"base rate.\" Rule 10 applies because typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 11 applies because contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the starting cost, which comes before the duration of the commercial. \nThe answer: $5,000,000", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to a company that was given permission to air TV commercials during Super Bowl 50 at a discounted price. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the companies' nationalities.

Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is asking about a company, not a profession or nationality. Rule 16 is relevant because it reminds us that first comes before last and last comes after first, and the question is asking about a specific company mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: Doritos", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the question. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"video gaming company\" and \"debuted their ad\". Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the names mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: Nintendo and The Pok\u00e9mon Company", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of professions.

Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any names mentioned. \nThe answer: The Pok\u00e9mon Company", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer involves identifying a company that was able to air multiple ads at a steep discount. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any rules related to professions. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Using this rule, we can infer that the company that was able to air multiple ads at a steep discount is Anheuser-Busch InBev. \nThe answer: Anheuser-Busch InBev", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Doritos", "{4, 15}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a profession. The rule 15 states that if A had profession X but changed to profession Y, then A has profession Y, so we can infer that the company in question is not a sponsor anymore. Therefore, the answer is Anheuser-Busch InBev. \nThe answer: Anheuser-Busch InBev", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the company that held its \"Crash the Super Bowl\" contest for the last time during the Super Bowl mentioned in the article. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of the nationality of the company. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that the company being referred to is Doritos. \nThe answer: Doritos", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Crash the Super Bowl\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Small Business Big Game\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Death Wish Coffee", "{rule list: size is a different concept}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the length of the Death Wish Coffee commercial. The relevant rule is that size is a different concept, meaning that the length of the commercial is not related to any other aspect of the article. \nThe answer: 30 seconds", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the size of the competitors is a different concept from the number of competitors. We use rule 16 to determine that the number of competitors comes before the mention of Death Wish Coffee. \nThe answer: nine other contenders", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the company that won a contest to have their ad shown for free during Super Bowl 50. The answer is Death Wish Coffee, as stated in the article. Rules 3 and 13 apply, as the answer requires identifying a company name mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: Death Wish Coffee", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" tells us that Death Wish Coffee is the company that won the contest. The rule that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\" tells us that Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders. \nThe answer: 9", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the company that sponsored a contest called \"Small Business Big Game\". Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that QuickBooks is a financial software company. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can identify \"sponsored\" as a synonym for \"hosted\" or \"organized\". Therefore, the answer is QuickBooks. \n\nThe answer: QuickBooks", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Death Wish Coffee", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that Death Wish Coffee beat out nine other contenders, indicating that there were a total of 10 companies in the QuickBooks contest.\nThe answer: 10", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the company that had a contest to win a free Super Bowl commercial. The passage mentions that QuickBooks sponsored a contest called \"Small Business Big Game\" and that Death Wish Coffee won the contest and had a 30-second commercial aired during the Super Bowl. This means that QuickBooks is the company that had the contest.

The answer can be found by identifying the production companies listed in the article and the movies they paid to promote during the Super Bowl. The relevant rule is that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Secret Life of Pets and the debut trailer for Jason Bourne.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Gods of Egypt", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the movie trailer that appeared alongside 10 Cloverfield Lane during the Super Bowl. The passage lists the movie trailers paid for by various studios, and we need to identify the one paid for by Paramount. Therefore, we can use rule 13 to determine that names are equally important for the answer. We can also use rule 3 to determine that the concept of movie trailers is different from the concept of the movies themselves. Finally, we can use rule 7 to recognize that the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. \nThe answer: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows", "{3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The article lists several movies that had trailers during the Super Bowl, including Independence Day. The question specifically asks for the subtitle of the Independence Day movie. Therefore, we can ignore the other movies mentioned in the article. The answer is \"Resurgence\".\nThe answer: Resurgence", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: Lionsgate paid for the trailer of \"Gods of Egypt\" to be aired during the Super Bowl.\nThe answer: Gods of Egypt", "{3, 7, 12, 13, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the movie trailer that Paramount paid for to be aired during the Super Bowl. The passage lists several movie trailers paid for by different studios. We can use rule 3 to differentiate between the movies and the studios that paid for them. Rule 7 tells us that we can use synonyms from the context paragraph to identify the relevant information. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the other movie trailers listed. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the movie trailer. Finally, rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the movie trailer by its position in the list of trailers paid for by Paramount. \nThe answer: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the movie trailer that Universal paid for along with The Secret Life of Pets. The relevant information is given in the passage. \nThe answer: Jason Bourne", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the third film trailer that Disney paid for to be aired during the Super Bowl.

Therefore, the answer is Captain America: Civil War.\nThe answer: Captain America: Civil War", "{3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The article lists several movies that were advertised during the Super Bowl, but only one of them is a sequel to a famous July Fourth holiday movie. The answer is Independence Day: Resurgence, which was advertised by Fox. \nThe answer: Independence Day: Resurgence", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the movie company that paid for the next Jason Bourne movie ad to be shown during the Super Bowl. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that the movie company is American. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"paid\" and \"next Jason Bourne movie.\" The answer is Universal. \nThe answer: Universal", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the company that paid for a Super Bowl 50 ad to show a trailer of X-Men: Apocalypse. The answer can be found in the passage where it states that 20th Century Fox paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl, including one for X-Men: Apocalypse. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and do not affect the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means that \"movie trailers\" and \"ad\" can be considered synonymous in this context. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the name \"20th Century Fox\" must be included in the answer.\nThe answer: 20th Century Fox", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the fact that Westwood One is a radio network and not a profession or nationality. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps identify that Westwood One is the radio network that carried the Super Bowl.\nThe answer: Westwood One", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Kevin Harlan is the first name mentioned after the announcement that Westwood One will carry the game. The rules of gendered pronouns help us identify that Kevin Harlan is referred to as \"he.\" \nThe answer: Kevin Harlan", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the person's profession being relevant to the answer.

The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Dan Fouts is one of the two color analysts mentioned after the play-by-play announcer. \nThe answer: Boomer Esiason", "{rule list: 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The article states that \"James Lofton and Mark Malone [were] sideline reporters.\" Since the question asks for the person who shared sideline reporting duties with Mark Malone, we can infer that James Lofton is the other person who shared those duties.\nThe answer: James Lofton", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The profession of the individuals involved in the Super Bowl broadcast is mentioned, indicating that profession and nationality are different concepts. The order in which the individuals are listed indicates that \"Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts\" are both color analysts.\nThe answer: 2", "{rule list: profession and names are important}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and names are important is relevant because the question asks for the name of the person who announced the game play-by-play. \nThe answer: Kevin Harlan", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: Westwood One is a broadcasting company, and the article states that they will carry the game throughout North America.

The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" tells us that we can ignore any information about the announcer's nationality or ethnicity. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" tells us that we should look for the name of the announcer first, followed by the names of the color analysts and sideline reporters.\nThe answer: Kevin Harlan", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the Westwood One color analysts is not relevant to the answer.

The use of \"will anchor\" suggests that he was involved in the pre-game and halftime coverage, but not the actual game itself.

Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that 103.5 FM is listed is important. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the rest of the information about the game and other stations. \nThe answer: KRFX", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage lists the flagship stations for each team and their respective play-by-play and color commentary announcers.

Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the BBC is a broadcasting corporation does not make it a TV network. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"TV network\" can be interpreted as \"broadcast\". Therefore, the answer is: BBC.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (3) means that the names of the commentators are more important than their nationality. Therefore, the answer can be found in the sentence \"The BBC will carry its own British English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary.\" The answer is: Greg Brady.", "{rule list: 16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Super Bowl II happened before any other Super Bowl mentioned in the article.

Marlee Matlin is an actress, so we can use rule 13 to determine that her name is important for the answer. Rule 16 tells us that we should prioritize the first and last names mentioned in the sentence, and in this case, Marlee Matlin is the only name mentioned.

The negation in the question (\"At what Super Bowl did Beyonc\u00e9 headline the halftime show?\") is important to note, as it requires the answer to provide the specific Super Bowl number rather than just stating that she has headlined a halftime show. \nThe answer: Super Bowl XLVII", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Coldplay collaborated with Beyonc\u00e9 on a single.

The passage is about the performers at the Super Bowl halftime show, so names are important for the answer. The answer: Coldplay.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the company that confirmed Beyonc\u00e9's participation in the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name of the company. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. Therefore, we can simply look for the answer without any special considerations. \nThe answer: Pepsi", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 collaborated on the single \"Hymn for the Weekend\"\nThe answer: \"Hymn for the Weekend\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Coldplay", "{rule list: 4, 7, 13, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific person who was confirmed to join Coldplay for the halftime show. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the performers' nationalities. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"join\" and \"halftime show\" in the passage. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the specific person mentioned. Rules 20 and 21 state that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we need to identify the gender of the person mentioned. \nThe answer: Beyonc\u00e9", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a song that Beyonc\u00e9 and Coldplay collaborated on. Rule 3 states that \"song\" is a different concept from \"size, shape, age, and color\" and rule 7 states that synonyms from the context paragraph may be used in the question. \nThe answer: \"Hymn for the Weekend\"", "{rule list: 14, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a former halftime show performer who joined Coldplay and Beyonc\u00e9 for the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. Rule 14 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. The answer is Bruno Mars. \n\nThe answer: Bruno Mars", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Denver", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the opening drive of a football game between Denver and Carolina. Peyton Manning completes a 22-yard pass to Andre Caldwell.\nThe answer: Andre Caldwell", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that Shaq Thompson tackled Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss, which means that Ronnie Hillman lost 3 yards. Rule 16 applies because Ronnie Hillman is mentioned before Shaq Thompson in the sentence.\nThe answer: Ronnie Hillman", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Denver [...] settled for a 3\u20130 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal.\" This indicates that Brandon McManus kicked the field goal for Denver.\nThe answer: Brandon McManus", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes a drive by the Denver team in a football game. The drive included two carries by a player named C. J. Anderson, which moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line. Therefore, C. J. Anderson ran the ball twice for 20 yards on this drive.\nThe answer: C. J. Anderson", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The pass was completed for 18 yards.\nThe answer: 18", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Shaq Thompson", "{rule list: 2, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the kicker of the field goal on Denver's first drive in Super Bowl 50. The relevant information is that Denver settled for a 3-0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal. Rule 2 applies because \"settled for\" implies that Denver would have preferred to score a touchdown instead of a field goal. Rule 13 applies because the name of the kicker is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Brandon McManus", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: Carolina had not faced a deficit in the entire postseason.\nThe answer: deficit", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Denver took the opening kickoff,\" indicating that Denver had the first kickoff.\nThe answer: Denver", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that the opening drive is the first offensive possession of the Denver team. The rule 22 helps us understand that \"the former\" refers to the first entity listed, which is Peyton Manning, and \"the latter\" refers to the last entity listed, which is Andre Caldwell.\nThe answer: Owen Daniels", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Denver started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell. A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line.\nThe answer: C. J. Anderson", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The first relevant rule is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the question asks for who scored the first points for Denver, implying that Denver was the team that scored first. Therefore, the answer must be a player from Denver. The second relevant rule is rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. In the passage, it is stated that Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong, and later it is mentioned that Denver scored a field goal to take a 3-0 lead. Therefore, the player who scored the first points for Denver must be Brandon McManus.\nThe answer: Brandon McManus", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a comparison between the opening drive and the entire postseason. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves a concept of score, which is different from concepts like size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: a deficit", "{7, 12, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a former referee who served as an analyst for CBS. Rule 7 states that synonyms in the question are important, so \"former referee\" and \"retired referee\" can be considered equivalent. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored, so the details about the game can be skipped. Rule 13 states that names are important, so the answer must be a name. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so the answer must be a male name. \nThe answer: Mike Carey", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a pass that was ruled incomplete, indicating that there was a comparison between whether the pass was complete or incomplete. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about whose pass it was, indicating that there were multiple possible passers. \nThe answer: Cam Newton's pass.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person who caused Cam Newton to fumble the ball. This is a passive sentence, so we need to look for the subject that is acted upon by the verb \"knocked\". The answer is Von Miller.\nThe answer: Von Miller", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the player who recovered the ball, which implies that possession of the ball was lost. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific player. \nThe answer: Malik Jackson.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the last time a fumble was returned for a touchdown in a Super Bowl was in Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season. \nThe answer: Super Bowl XXVIII", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jerricho Cotchery", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for an analyst who disagreed with the ruling of an incomplete pass. Rules 17 and 18 state that negations in both the question and context are important for the answer. The answer can be found in the context, which states that CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey disagreed with the call. \nThe answer: Mike Carey", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The text states that linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton's hands while sacking him.\nThe answer: Von Miller", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the player who received the ball that Cam Newton lost during a tackle. Rule 1 tells us that if A lost something to B, then B gained something from A. Rule 16 tells us that the subject of a sentence comes before the object. Therefore, the answer is Malik Jackson. \nThe answer: Malik Jackson", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the last time a fumble return touchdown like this occurred was at the end of the 1993 season, which means it was in Super Bowl XXVIII.\nThe answer: 1993", "{7, 18, 20}\nExplanation: We need to identify the retired referee who disagreed with the call of an incomplete pass. Rule 7 tells us that synonyms in the question may be present in the context paragraph. Rule 18 tells us that negations in the question are important for the answer. Rule 20 tells us that \"he\" refers to male names. Therefore, we can identify the answer as Mike Carey. \nThe answer: Mike Carey", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Von Miller", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Malik Jackson recovered a fumble and ran it into the end zone for a touchdown during the Super Bowl. The answer is Malik Jackson. \nThe answer: Malik Jackson", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the last time a fumble return touchdown happened in a Super Bowl. This requires understanding the timeline of Super Bowl events, which is a chronological order. Additionally, we need to recognize that the sentence is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject (the fumble return touchdown) is being acted upon (happened) by the verb. \nThe answer: Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jonathan Stewart", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states \"After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track...\" which indicates that both teams punted the ball before Carolina's scoring drive. Therefore, the answer is not specific to a single punter, but rather both teams punted. \nThe answer: Both teams punted.", "{rule list: 3, 10}\nExplanation: The passage states that Brad Nortman's punt was \"short\" and does not give an exact distance. However, this is not relevant to the answer as the question only asks for the number of yards the punt traveled. Typos in the question are also irrelevant.\nThe answer: Not given", "{rule list: 3, 6}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Jordan Norwood returned a punt for a Super Bowl record, indicating that he returned it for more yards than any other player in Super Bowl history. The passage also states that the return was for 61 yards, which directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 61 yards.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal.\" Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 16 states that numerical information should be directly stated in the passage. Therefore, the answer is: 33.", "{rule list: 3, 10}\nExplanation: The passage states that Cam Newton completed 4 of 4 passes for 51 yards.\nThe answer: 51", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The Carolina team scored a touchdown, as indicated by the phrase \"Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.\" This occurred in the second quarter, as indicated by the phrase \"with 11:28 left in the second quarter.\" \nThe answer: Jonathan Stewart", "{rule list: first comes before last and last comes after first}\nExplanation: The article states that the touchdown occurred \"with 11:28 left in the second quarter.\"\nThe answer: 11:28", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jordan Norwood", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 33 yards", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes a 9-play, 73-yard scoring drive by Carolina, during which Newton completed 4 passes for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, and Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. The touchdown was scored in the second quarter, with 11:28 left on the clock. Therefore, the answer is Jonathan Stewart.\nThe answer: Jonathan Stewart", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Denver had good field position but could not score a touchdown, so they settled for a field goal. This is an example of an active sentence, where the subject (Denver) acted upon the verb (scored). \nThe answer: Denver kicked a 33-yard field goal.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Darian Stewart", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because it is asking for the name of a specific player. \nThe answer: linebacker", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule about different concepts (3) tells us that we need to focus on the specific player who tipped the pass, which is Kony Ealy. The rule about first and last (16) tells us that Ealy is the last player mentioned in the passage before the interception, so he is the one who made the play.\nThe answer: Kony Ealy", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the subject of the verb \"was sacked\" in the passive sentence \"Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half.\" Rule 16 tells us that in a sentence, the subject comes before the verb. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, the subject of the sentence is \"Newton.\" \nThe answer: Newton", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who sacked Cam Newton at the end of the half, which refers to a specific moment in the game. Therefore, we use rule 16 to determine that \"last comes after first\" and identify the player who sacked Newton as DeMarcus Ware.\nThe answer: DeMarcus Ware", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is being compared to B as more or less of something, then B is less or more of that thing than A, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. In this case, the passage states that fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, so Darian Stewart tackled Mike Tolbert. \nThe answer: Mike Tolbert", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it,\" indicating that Kony Ealy tipped the pass.\nThe answer: Kony Ealy", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line.\" This means that the interception gained 19 yards.\nThe answer: 19 yards", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the player who tackled the Carolina Panthers' quarterback just before the end of the first half. The relevant information is in the last sentence of the passage, which states that Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half. Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as players and time, should not be confused. Rule 12 states that irrelevant information should be ignored. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: DeMarcus Ware", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The rule of \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the sentence states that fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart. The rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies because the sentence mentions both Mike Tolbert and Darian Stewart, and Mike Tolbert is mentioned first. \nThe answer: Mike Tolbert.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Danny Trevathan", "{rule list: 23, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes a play-by-play of a football game. In this specific play, Kony Ealy tipped a pass from Manning and intercepted it, giving the ball back to the Panthers. The question asks for the name of the player who intercepted the pass. Therefore, rules 23 and 16 are relevant, as they establish that passive voice is used in the sentence (\"a Manning pass was intercepted\") and that the subject (Kony Ealy) comes after the verb (\"intercepted\"). \nThe answer: Kony Ealy", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the events of a football game, specifically a drive by the Carolina Panthers. The question asks how the drive ended. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can look to the end of the passage to find the answer.\nThe answer: Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: DeMarcus Ware", "{rule list: 2, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes a play in a football game where Cam Newton completed a 45-yard pass. The question asks for the name of the player who caught the pass. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the phrase \"on the receiving end\" as a synonym for \"caught.\" Rule 12 applies because the passage contains some irrelevant information about the subsequent plays. \nThe answer: Ted Ginn Jr.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes a missed field goal attempt by the Panthers, which is a specific event. Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they establish the relationship between the Panthers' missed field goal attempt and the Broncos' subsequent scoring drive. Rule 12 is relevant because it allows us to ignore the irrelevant details about the Broncos' scoring drive. \nThe answer: Graham Gano", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the distance of the missed field goal. Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept from distance, so we can ignore the mention of the 26-yard line. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the missed field goal as the first field goal attempt mentioned in the paragraph, which was a 44-yard attempt. \nThe answer: 44", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: McManus", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: T. J. Ward", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the opening drive of the second half of a football game, during which Newton completed a 45-yard pass to a player on his team.\nThe answer: Ted Ginn Jr.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt\" is in the active voice, meaning that Gano was the one who hit the uprights. Therefore, rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) and rule 23 (active vs passive voice) are relevant.\nThe answer: the uprights", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the player who intercepted Newton on the Panthers' next set of downs. Rule 3 tells us that we should focus on the concept of \"players\" and not confuse it with other concepts like \"teams\" or \"positions\". Rule 12 tells us that some parts of the context may be irrelevant to the answer, so we can skip over the details about the missed field goal and the fumble. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the pass bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by a Broncos player. \nThe answer: T. J. Ward", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, T.J. Ward fumbled the ball during the return, but Trevathan recovered it, so the answer is Trevathan.\nThe answer: Trevathan", "{rule list: 1, 2, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the player that Newton completed a pass to in the Panther starting plays of Super Bowl 50. The relevant information is in the first sentence of the article, which states that Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play. Therefore, the answer is Ted Ginn Jr.\nThe answer: Ted Ginn Jr.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The Broncos stopped the Panthers on the 26-yard line, which was on their opening drive of the second half.\nThe answer: 26-yard line", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt.\" This is a passive sentence, where the subject (the field goal attempt) is acted upon by the verb (hit). Therefore, the answer is Graham Gano.\nThe answer: Graham Gano", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The first relevant rule is rule 1, which states that if A completes X after B's attempt to complete X, then A was more successful than B. In this case, Manning completed two passes after Carolina's failed field goal attempt, indicating that he was more successful than Carolina's offense. The second relevant rule is rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. In this case, Manning is mentioned before Sanders, indicating that Manning threw the passes and Sanders caught them.\nThe answer: Emmanuel Sanders", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes a play in a football game where the Broncos were driving towards the Panthers' side of the field. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning's hand and recovered it for Carolina. \nThe answer: Ealy", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from others, so the answer is not \"a field goal of 39 yards\", but rather \"39-yard field goal\". Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last\", so we know that the field goal was kicked by Graham Gano, and not by any other player. \nThe answer: 39-yard field goal", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess came before the 12-yard run by Stewart. Rule 23 establishes that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Since the question asks for the person who caught the pass, we need to look for the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the answer is Devin Funchess. \n\nThe answer: Devin Funchess", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes a drive by the Broncos that ended with a fumble and recovery by the Panthers, followed by a 12-yard run by Stewart. \nThe answer: Stewart", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line.\"\nThe answer: 41-yard line", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line.\" The subject of the sentence is Ealy, who is the one who knocked the ball out of Manning's hands. The sentence is in the active voice, so the subject is the one performing the action. \nThe answer: Ealy", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16, which states that \"next\" refers to the chronological order of events. The answer is \"on the 50-yard line.\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: punts", "{rule list: 13, 17, 22}\nExplanation: The last name of the player who bumped the ball away from Manning is being asked. {13: names are equally important for the answer} {17: negations are important for the answer} {22: if two entities are listed, then \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last}\nThe answer: Ealy", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage states that the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line before Manning lost the ball, so the answer is the 41-yard line.\nThe answer: 41-yard line", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Gano's 39-yard field goal\" cut the Panthers' deficit to one score at 16-10. This means that the field goal was 39 yards.\nThe answer: 39", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the next three drives of the game would end in punts.\" This means that all three of the following drives ended in punts.\nThe answer: 3", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line\". This means that Carolina began on their own 24-yard line.\nThe answer: 24-yard line", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"On the next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton\" is in the active voice, meaning that Newton is the subject who had the ball stripped away from him by Miller. \nThe answer: Newton", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Josh Norman", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Anderson scored a 2-yard touchdown run, which means he punched the ball in from the 2-yard line.\nThe answer: Anderson", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts, names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the receiver on the successful 2-point conversion.\nThe answer: Bennie Fowler", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who stripped the ball from Newton, which is an action that was taken by someone else. Therefore, we need to apply rule 1 to determine that the person who stripped the ball is more aggressive than Newton, and then apply rule 8 to determine that Newton is less aggressive than the person who stripped the ball. \nThe answer: Miller", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes a football game where Carolina had the ball and faced a 3rd-and-9 situation. Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Therefore, Ward recovered the strip ball.\nThe answer: Ward", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Newton", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Josh Norman", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states \"With 4:51 left in regulation\" and \"giving Denver a 24\u201310 lead with 3:08 left\", indicating that Denver took the score to 24-10 with 3:08 left in the game.\nThe answer: 3:08 left", "{rule list: first comes before last and last comes after first, negations in the question are important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the time on the clock when Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line in the fourth quarter, so we need to look for a mention of the time in the article. The article states \"With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line\", so the answer is 4:51. The negation in the question (\"what was the time\") is important for understanding that we are looking for a specific time. \nThe answer: 4:51", "{1, 8, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the player who took the ball away from Newton, implying that Newton had possession of the ball before. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the last name of the player, and the article only mentions the player's last name. Rule 13 applies because names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Miller.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that \"with 4:51 left in regulation\" refers to the end of the fourth quarter of a football game. Rule 22 helps us understand that \"Ward\" is the last name of the player who recovered the ball.\nThe answer: Ward", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays.\nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the player who scored a 2-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the player who scored the touchdown is more relevant than any other player mentioned in the passage. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that any information about these concepts is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 applies because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which means that the player's last name is the relevant information needed to answer the question.\nThe answer: Anderson", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Miller had six total tackles (five solo), 2\u00bd sacks, and two forced fumbles.\" This means that Miller had 5 solo sacks in the game.\nThe answer: 5", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Manning had zero touchdowns, as stated in the passage. The question asks for the number of touchdowns he threw, so the negation in the question (did not throw) is important and rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: zero", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"McManus made all four of his field goals\", indicating that he kicked four field goals in the game.\nThe answer: 4", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Thomas Davis is the player in question, as he is mentioned after Luke Kuechly and Charles Johnson. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that Davis played in the Super Bowl despite his injury, as the sentence is in the active voice (\"despite playing\") rather than the passive voice. \nThe answer: Thomas Davis", "{rule list: 23, 24}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards, with one interception.\" This sentence is in the active voice, meaning that Newton is the subject and he completed the action of throwing the passes and the interception happened to him. Therefore, the answer is one.\nThe answer: one", "{rule list: 23, 16}\nExplanation: Manning is the subject of the sentence and \"finished the game\" is the verb, indicating that this is an active sentence. The number of interceptions is the object of the sentence. The order of the subject and verb in the sentence indicates that the answer comes after the verb. \nThe answer: one interception", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Manning had \"zero touchdowns\" at the end of the game.\nThe answer: zero", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that Anderson was the game's leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown, along with four receptions for 10 yards. Therefore, Anderson was the game's leading rusher.\nThe answer: Anderson", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists the stats of various players in a game. Sanders had the most receptions and yards among all receivers, making him the top receiver.\nThe answer: Sanders", "{rule list: 16, 22, 23}\nExplanation: The rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Thomas Davis is the player in question, as he is mentioned after Luke Kuechly. Additionally, the rule of \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\" confirms that Kuechly is the first player mentioned and Davis is the second. Finally, the rule of \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" tells us that the sentence \"despite playing just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game\" is in the active voice, meaning that Davis played in the Super Bowl despite his injury. \nThe answer: Thomas Davis", "{rule list: 3, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the last name of Manning's top receiver. Rule 3 states that color is not relevant, while rule 16 states that last names come after first names. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. \nThe answer: Sanders", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the player who was the Super Bowl 50 winner's leading rusher. The relevant information is that \"Anderson was the game's leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown.\" Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the players' physical characteristics. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify \"Anderson\" as the last name of the player in question.\nThe answer: Anderson", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"McManus made all four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season.\"\nThe answer: 4", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards, with one interception.\" \nThe answer: one", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article lists the stats of various players in Super Bowl 50, including Charles Johnson's \"four total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble.\" \nThe answer: 4", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the total yards gained by Denver, which is less than the total yards gained by Carolina. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific concept, which is the size of the yards gained by Denver. \nThe answer: 194.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the number of first downs Denver had, which is less than the number of first downs Carolina had. Rule 16 applies because the passage explicitly states that Denver had 11 first downs. \nThe answer: 11", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the previous record for lowest total yards by a Super Bowl winning team was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Therefore, the answer is the Baltimore Ravens. \nThe answer: Baltimore Ravens", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person who returned a punt for 61 yards, which is a record. Rule 3 tells us that we can differentiate between concepts, so we know that \"returned a punt\" refers to a specific action. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can identify that Jordan Norwood is the person who set the record. \nThe answer: Jordan Norwood", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of nationality in the passage. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that the last mentioned quarterback in the passage is Manning, who is mentioned as the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams. Therefore, the answer is Manning. \n\nThe answer: Manning", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so we cannot assume that being outgained in total yards means Denver had less yards than Carolina. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Carolina outgained Denver, then Denver was outgained by Carolina. Therefore, the answer is not 194 yards, but rather 315 yards. \nThe answer: 315 yards", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the number of first downs Denver had, which is less than the number of first downs Carolina had. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific statistic, which is the number of first downs. \nThe answer: 11", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Chicago Bears", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Gary Kubiak went to the Super Bowl with a certain franchise as a player and later won a Super Bowl as a head coach with the same franchise. Therefore, we can use rule 22 to determine that the former refers to the team he played for and the latter refers to the team he coached. The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but we can infer that Kubiak played for the Denver Broncos since he later became their head coach and led them to a Super Bowl victory. \nThe answer: Denver Broncos", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards and first downs, and that their 11 first downs were the lowest ever by a Super Bowl winning team. Therefore, the Panthers had less than 11 first downs.\nThe answer: less than 11", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Broncos had 11 first downs in Super Bowl 50, which is the lowest total ever by a Super Bowl winning team. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to understand that \"lowest\" means \"least\" and rule 16 to determine that the answer is 11.\nThe answer: 11", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the team with the lowest downs and yards, which means that other teams have had more downs and yards. Rule 3 applies because downs and yards are measures of performance, not size, shape, age, or color. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a superlative, which means that the answer must be compared to other teams. \nThe answer: Denver", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Broncos tied a Super Bowl record for sacks, and also mentions that the Chicago Bears set the record in Super Bowl XX. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that \"Super Bowl XX\" refers to the 20th Super Bowl, and rule 16 to determine that the Bears were the team that set the record. \nThe answer: Chicago Bears", "{16, 19}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that Manning is a person and rule 19 to determine that his gender is irrelevant to his profession. The answer is: two.", "{1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: We need to identify the achievement of Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie, who is a person. Gender is irrelevant to profession, so rule 19 applies. The question uses her full name, so rule 13 applies. The answer is an award, so rule 3 applies. The question uses the phrase \"first female recipient,\" so rules 20 and 21 apply. Rule 4 applies because profession and nationality are different concepts.\nThe answer: the Nobel Prize", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The article does not provide the year of Casimir Pulaski's birth in Warsaw.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and first comes before last (rule 16). \nThe answer: Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie", "{rule list: 3, 16, 21}\nExplanation: Chopin was a famous musician who was born in the village of \u017belazowa Wola, but moved to Warsaw with his family when he was seven months old.\nThe answer: a famous musician", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: seven months old", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are over 100 different species of trees in the Saxon Garden. \nThe answer: over 100", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes several parks in Warsaw, but only mentions the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden as a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians.\nThe answer: Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The Saxon Garden was formally a royal garden, according to the passage.\nThe answer: Saxon Garden", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Saxon Garden and mentions that the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated at the east end of the park. This answer follows rule 3, which states that location is an important concept, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: the east end", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes several parks in Warsaw, each with their own unique features. The question specifically asks for the park that covers an area of 76 ha, which is mentioned in the passage as the \u0141azienki Park. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes size as a separate concept from other features of the parks, and rule 12 is relevant because it allows us to ignore information about other parks that is not relevant to the question. \nThe answer: \u0141azienki Park", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 15 kilometres (9 miles)", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Therefore, the answer should only include the names of animals. \nThe answer: otter, beaver, and hundreds of bird species.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of natural reserves is not related to any of these concepts. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the number of natural reserves as the first piece of information given in the article. \nThe answer: 13", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions several lakes in Warsaw, including oxbow lakes, lakes in parks, and small lakes. However, it also notes that only a few are permanent and the majority are emptied before winter. Therefore, we should only count the permanent lakes. \nThe answer: only a few permanent lakes, but the article does not provide an exact number.", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: Small lakes in the parks are emptied before winter to clean them of plants and sediments.\nThe answer: to clean them of plants and sediments.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is related to any of those concepts. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to infer that if Warsaw was the most diverse city in Poland, then other cities in Poland were less diverse. \nThe answer: cities in Poland", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants, 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. This means that 833,500 inhabitants spoke Polish in 1933.\nThe answer: 833,500", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the demographics of Warsaw, including the significant Jewish minority. The specific question asks for the percentage of the population that was Jewish in 1897, which is given as around 34%. \nThe answer: around 34%", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw.\nThe answer: Jews", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation.\" This answer is straightforward and does not require any complex rules. Rule 3 is included to clarify that demographic diversity and population growth are different concepts. Rule 16 is included to prioritize the most recent information about Warsaw's population growth. \nThe answer: internal migration and urbanisation", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and size are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps us identify which institution is being referred to as the second academic school of technology. The answer is Warsaw University of Technology. \nThe answer: Warsaw University of Technology", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Warsaw University of Technology is one of the largest academic schools of technology in East-Central Europe and employs 2,000 professors.\nThe answer: 2,000", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: Size and profession are different concepts, so we can't assume that the oldest and largest music school is also the largest medical school. National Defence University and Fryderyk Chopin University of Music are not relevant to the question. The answer is: the Medical University of Warsaw.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the passage, the University of Warsaw is the first institution for higher education mentioned, and its establishment is explicitly stated as having occurred in 1816.\nThe answer: 1816", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from profession and nationality, so we can ignore those rules. However, we need to pay attention to names, as the question asks for a specific institution. The answer: Fryderyk Chopin University of Music.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The University Library was founded in 1816, as stated in the article.\nThe answer: 1816", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the University Library is home to over two million items.\nThe answer: over two million.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Zbigniew Badowski is an architect who designed the University Library building.\nThe answer: architect", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the University Library garden was designed by Irena Bajerska. \nThe answer: Irena Bajerska", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the University Library garden has an area of more than 10,000 m2 (107,639.10 sq ft), and plants covering 5,111 m2 (55,014.35 sq ft). This means that the garden covers at least 5,111 m2.\nThe answer: 5,111 m2", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: infrastructure", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the initial Three-Year Plan to rebuild Poland, especially Warsaw, was a major success.\nThe answer: The initial Three-Year Plan to rebuild Poland, especially Warsaw.", "{1, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Warsaw has seen improvements due to solid economic growth, an increase in foreign investment, and funding from the European Union. Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A is the cause of X, then B is the effect of X. Rule 4 applies because it clarifies that profession and nationality are different concepts, and therefore the fact that foreign investment has increased is not related to the nationality of the investors. Rule 8 applies because it clarifies that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and therefore the opposite of \"improvements\" is \"deterioration\". \nThe answer: solid economic growth, increase in foreign investment, and funding from the European Union", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from infrastructure, which includes sidewalks and sanitation facilities. Animals and vehicles are also different concepts from infrastructure. \nThe answer: improved", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the location of the best medical facilities in East-Central Europe. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the facilities are in Poland does not affect the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the specific names of the medical facilities mentioned in the article are relevant. \nThe answer: Warsaw, specifically the Children's Memorial Health Institute and the Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Institute of Oncology.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI) is the highest-reference hospital in all of Poland.\nThe answer: Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI)", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts, size and shape are different concepts}\nExplanation: The passage describes medical facilities in Warsaw, specifically mentioning the Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Institute of Oncology as one of the largest and most modern oncological institutions in Europe.\nThe answer: The Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Institute of Oncology.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Institute of Oncology has a clinical section located in a 10-floor building with 700 beds. This means that the answer to the question is 700.\nThe answer: 700", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the development of infrastructure in Warsaw's medical facilities over the past years. This is a concept rule as it refers to the physical facilities and resources available. Additionally, this question does not require any specific names or locations, so rules 13 and 14 are not relevant.\nThe answer: developed", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The type of venue is being asked, which falls under the concept of \"shape\" and \"category\". The name of the venue is given, which falls under the concept of \"names\". \nThe answer: musical venue (or opera house)", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking about what events or festivals Warsaw hosts, which falls under the concept of \"things/events\" and not \"profession/nationality\" or \"animals/vehicles\". Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply. Additionally, the question is asking about a general concept, not a specific instance, so the names of the events are not important, only the fact that Warsaw hosts many of them. Therefore, rule 13 applies. \nThe answer: events and festivals", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The location of the Congress Hall is important for the answer, and negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Palace of Culture and Science", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of the Jazz Jamboree event. Rule 3 states that location is an important concept, and rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Warsaw", "{3, 4, 5, 7}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The question contains a synonym for \"events\" with \"one of the many,\" so rule 7 applies. \nThe answer: festivals", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"Ogr\u00f3d Saski\" as the Polish name for the Saxon Garden.\nThe answer: Ogr\u00f3d Saski", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Summer Theatre was located \"in Ogr\u00f3d Saski (the Saxon Garden).\" The negation in the question (\"where\") is important to note, as it indicates that the answer should be a location. Additionally, the name of the location is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Ogr\u00f3d Saski (the Saxon Garden)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: from 1870 to 1939", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Momus", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes several theaters in Warsaw, but only one is referred to as the \"best example of 'Polish monumental theatre'\": the Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski Theatre. This theater is listed first in the sentence, before the other theaters mentioned, indicating that it is the one being referred to. Additionally, the use of the superlative \"best\" emphasizes its importance. \nThe answer: the Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski Theatre", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Wianki", "{3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to find the number of people who gather for the Wianki festival. This information is not explicitly stated in the passage, but we can infer that \"gatherings of thousands of people\" take place, which implies that there are at least 2000 people present. Therefore, we can answer the question by saying \"thousands of people\". \nThe answer: thousands of people", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the festival takes place on Midsummer's Night. \"Wianki\" is Polish for \"Wreaths,\" which is mentioned in the passage as the name of the festival. \nThe answer: On Midsummer's Night", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: when they would be married and to whom", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a tradition on Midsummer's Eve where people look for a specific flower. This flower is referred to as the \"fern flower.\" This is a specific type of flower that is sought after during the festivities. Therefore, rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph) are relevant.\nThe answer: fern flower", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: art posters", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"Warsaw's 60 museums,\" indicating that there are 60 museums in Warsaw.\nThe answer: 60", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the National Museum in Warsaw has a collection of works ranging from antiquity to the present epoch and one of the best collections of paintings in the country, including some paintings from Adolf Hitler's private collection. This indicates that the National Museum is one of the most prestigious museums in Warsaw in terms of its collection of works and paintings.\nThe answer: prestigious museums in Warsaw", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"National Museum with a collection of works whose origin ranges in time from antiquity till the present epoch as well as one of the best collections of paintings in the country including some paintings from Adolf Hitler's private collection.\" The use of \"including\" indicates that the National Museum has some paintings from Adolf Hitler's private collection.\nThe answer: paintings", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: arms", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions several museums in Warsaw, but only the Warsaw Uprising Museum is described as a \"fine tribute to the fall of Warsaw.\" Additionally, the question specifically asks for where a tribute to the fall of Warsaw can be found, so the other museums are not relevant. \nThe answer: Warsaw Uprising Museum", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions several museums in Warsaw, but only one is specifically mentioned as preserving the memory of a crime - the Katy\u0144 Museum. \nThe answer: Katy\u0144 Museum", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: historic stereoscopic theatre", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Museum of Independence", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size is a different concept from others, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that the Warsaw Historical Museum contains 60 rooms, so the answer is 60.\nThe answer: 60", "{rule list: 13, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that the Royal Ujazd\u00f3w Castle currently houses the Centre for Contemporary Art. This is a straightforward answer extraction task that requires identifying the subject (Royal Ujazd\u00f3w Castle) and the object (Centre for Contemporary Art) in the sentence. Rules 13 and 23 are relevant because they emphasize the importance of names and passive voice in the answer extraction process.\nThe answer: Royal Ujazd\u00f3w Castle", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: We only need to focus on the sentence that mentions the Centre for Contemporary Art and its projects. The number of projects realized by the Centre is explicitly stated in the sentence. \nThe answer: about 500 projects a year.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Zach\u0119ta National Gallery of Art", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can use the synonym \"modern\" instead of \"contemporary\". Therefore, the answer is: modern art by Polish and international artists.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: last weekend of September", "{rule list: 1, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions Polonia Warsaw as the local rivals of another team, but it does not mention the name of the team that won the Ekstraklasa Championship in 2000. However, since the article only provides information about Polonia Warsaw's achievements, it can be inferred that they are the team that won the championship in 2000.\nThe answer: Polonia Warsaw", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1946", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Polonia Warsaw \"won the cup twice as well.\" This indicates that they have won the cup two times. Additionally, the information about their current league and financial situation is irrelevant to the question.\nThe answer: twice", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Polonia's home venue is located at Konwiktorska Street, which is a specific location and therefore falls under rule 3. The irrelevant information about their championship wins and relegation can be ignored using rule 12. The location information is given in the context paragraph and can be extracted using rule 16.\nThe answer: Konwiktorska Street", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: their disastrous financial situation", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for a translation of a specific word in Polish. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: syrenka", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"symbols\" are different from concepts like size, shape, age, and color eliminates those as possible answers. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" means that the answer must include the specific name of the symbol, which is \"the mermaid (syrenka).\" \nThe answer: the mermaid (syrenka)", "{1, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between the mermaid and other symbols that may be mentioned in the article. Rule 7 is relevant because the question asks for a specific time period, which may be expressed in different ways. Rule 13 is relevant because the question asks about the history of a symbol, which may involve the use of names and dates.\nThe answer: since at least the mid-14th century.", "{3, 10, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the date of the oldest armed seal of Warsaw, which is mentioned in the passage as being from the year 1390. The relevant rules are 3 (date is a different concept from shape or color), 10 (typos in the question are irrelevant), 13 (the name of the city is important for the answer), and 16 (the date comes before the description of the seal). \nThe answer: The oldest armed seal of Warsaw is from the year 1390.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the use of a sea monster with a female upper body as Warsaw's symbol, and mentions that it holds a sword in its claws. \nThe answer: A sword", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a legend about the origin of the mermaid figure", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a location where two of Triton's daughters set out on a journey through. Rule 13 states that locations are equally important for the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: the depths of the oceans and seas", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the location where one of Triton's daughters decided to stay. Rule 3 states that locations are important for the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the daughter who stayed in Denmark was mentioned first. \nThe answer: the coast of Denmark", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The village is Warszowa and it is mentioned in the passage after the mermaid reaches the mouth of the Vistula River and before the greedy merchant captures her.\nThe answer: Warszowa", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: captured her", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Tamara de Lempicka was born in Warsaw, as stated in the article.\nThe answer: Warsaw", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Tamara de Lempicka married a Polish lawyer Tadeusz \u0141empicki in 1916. In an active sentence, the subject (Tamara) acts the verb (married) and the object (Tadeusz \u0141empicki) is acted upon the verb. Therefore, rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and rule 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb) apply.\nThe answer: 1916", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer refers to a specific trait or skill that Lempicka possessed, which is compared to others in her field. Therefore, rule 3 applies to differentiate between concepts such as style and profession. Rule 4 also applies to differentiate between nationality and profession. Finally, rule 17 applies to consider negations in the question. \nThe answer: The Art Deco style in painting and art.", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: Nathan Alterman was born in Warsaw, so his nationality is Polish. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we cannot assume his profession based on his nationality. However, the passage states that Nathan Alterman was an Israeli poet, so we can infer that he became a poet after moving to Israel. Rule 16 states that if someone had profession X but changed to profession Y, then they have profession Y. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can assume that Nathan Alterman is male. Therefore, the answer is: poet.", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Warsaw was the beloved city of Isaac Bashevis Singer, which he described in many of his novels.\" This tells us that Isaac Bashevis Singer loved Warsaw and wrote about it in his novels.\nThe answer: Isaac Bashevis Singer", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Economist Intelligence Unit", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the ranking of Warsaw as the 32nd most liveable city in the world. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the year of the ranking, not the current ranking. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed and \"latter\" to the last, but since there is only one entity mentioned in the question, this rule is not relevant. \nThe answer: 2012", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the characteristics of Warsaw's economy. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these should not be relevant. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any information about the nationality of Warsaw should not be relevant. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so any information about these should not be relevant. Rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so any information about these should not be relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know what Warsaw's economy is characterized by, we can infer what it is not characterized by. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. \nThe answer: FMCG manufacturing, metal processing, steel and electronic manufacturing and food processing.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is one of the largest and most important in Central and Eastern Europe. This falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Warsaw Stock Exchange", "{rule list: 4, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The agency is a part of the European Union, which is a political and economic union of European countries. Therefore, rule 4 applies to distinguish between the concepts of profession and nationality. Rule 13 applies because the name of the agency is important for the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"external border security\"), which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Frontex", "{rule list: 1, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The first historical reference to Warsaw dates back to the year 1313.\" This is a straightforward answer that can be found by identifying the first mention of Warsaw in the passage. Rules 1, 12, and 16 are relevant because they help to identify the relevant information and ignore irrelevant details. \nThe answer: The year 1313.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the city that served as Poland's capital in 1313. The passage states that the first historical reference to Warsaw dates back to 1313, but at that time Krak\u00f3w served as the Polish capital city. Therefore, the answer is Krak\u00f3w.\nThe answer: Krak\u00f3w", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if Warsaw became the capital of the Kingdom of Poland, then Krak\u00f3w was no longer the capital. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the question is asking for a specific time period. Rule 23 is relevant because it establishes that the answer will likely be in passive voice since it is discussing a historical event. \nThe answer: Warsaw became the capital of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596.\"\nThe answer: King Sigismund III Vasa", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Warsaw has survived many wars, conflicts, and invasions throughout its long history, and required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II. This implies that the city has risen from the ashes like a phoenix. Additionally, the passage mentions that the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism during the Siege of Warsaw in 1939, which further emphasizes the city's resilience. \nThe answer: Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts, and invasions throughout its long history and required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Warsaw is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese on the left bank of the Vistula and a diocese on the right bank. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that an archdiocese is a religious entity and not a nationality. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the archdiocese is on the left bank of the Vistula. \nThe answer: a Roman Catholic archdiocese on the left bank of the Vistula.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"various universities, most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw,\" indicating that these are the two most notable universities in Warsaw. \nThe answer: There is no other university mentioned as notable in the passage.", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Warsaw's Old Town was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, indicating that it was recognized for its cultural significance. \nThe answer: a UNESCO World Heritage Site", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes various architectural attractions in Warsaw, including the Castle Square with the Royal Castle and King Sigismund's Column. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that King Sigismund's Column is not the name of a person or a location. Therefore, the answer is: a monument.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. The relevant passage states that \"around a quarter of the city is filled with luxurious parks and royal gardens,\" indicating that the answer is parks and gardens.\nThe answer: parks and royal gardens", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Warsaw's name in the Polish language is Warszawa.\nThe answer: Warszawa", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule about language and the rule about synonyms are not relevant to this question. The passage explains that Warszawa is the Polish name for Warsaw and that it means \"belonging to Warsz\", which is a shortened form of the name Warcis\u0142aw. The passage also mentions a folk etymology that attributes the name to a fisherman named Wars and his wife Sawa, but this is not the true origin of the name. Therefore, the answer is \"belonging to Warsz\". \nThe answer: belonging to Warsz", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Warsz was a 12th/13th-century nobleman who owned a village located at the modern-day site of Mariensztat neighbourhood.\nThe answer: a 12th/13th-century nobleman", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a village located at the modern-day site of Mariensztat neighbourhood", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the official city name of Warsaw is \"miasto sto\u0142eczne Warszawa\" in Polish, which translates to \"The Capital City of Warsaw.\" Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that the concepts of name and language are different. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the first part of the name comes before the last part.\nThe answer: miasto sto\u0142eczne Warszawa", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jazd\u00f3w", "{3, 16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from profession is not relevant to this question. The first comes before last and last comes after first rule is relevant because it helps identify that Boles\u0142aw II of Masovia was a prince of P\u0142ock. The rule that names are equally important for the answer is also relevant. \nThe answer: Boles\u0142aw II of Masovia was the Prince of P\u0142ock who established the settlement that became modern-day Warsaw.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the establishment of the settlement which would become Warsaw. The passage states that the settlement was established by the Prince of P\u0142ock, Boles\u0142aw II of Masovia, in about 1300. This satisfies rule 3, which states that age is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: about 1300", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1413", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the duchy was reincorporated into the Polish Crown in 1526.\" This gives us a specific year as the answer.\nThe answer: 1526", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the General Sejm", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1569", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the city gave its name to the Warsaw Confederation, formally establishing religious freedom in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\" This means that the Warsaw Confederation formally established religious freedom.\nThe answer: religious freedom", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596.\nThe answer: King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage stating that King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596. Rule 16 helps to identify that the first event mentioned in the passage is the earliest, and therefore the move to Warsaw happened after 1529. Rule 23 helps to understand that the sentence is in the active voice, with the subject (King Sigismund III Vasa) performing the action (moving his court to Warsaw). \nThe answer: 1596", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Warsaw remained the capital of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1796. This means that it was the capital for a period of time before 1796. Therefore, we can infer that it was the capital for at least several years, but we cannot determine the exact length of time. \nThe answer: Cannot be determined.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the event of Warsaw being annexed happened before it became the capital of the Duchy of Warsaw. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the Kingdom of Prussia is the subject of the sentence and that it annexed Warsaw. \nThe answer: Kingdom of Prussia", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Napoleon's army came before the year 1806. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that \"Napoleon's army\" is the subject that acted upon the verb \"liberated\". \nThe answer: Napoleon's army", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Following the Congress of Vienna of 1815, Warsaw became the centre of the Congress Poland.\" This is a passive sentence, where \"Warsaw\" is the subject and \"became the centre of the Congress Poland\" is the verb. Therefore, we need to apply rules 16 and 23 to determine that the answer is \"1815\". \nThe answer: 1815", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1816", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918.\" This means that the occupation lasted from August 4, 1915, until November 1918, which is a period of approximately 3 years and 3 months.\nThe answer: from August 4, 1915, until November 1918 (approximately 3 years and 3 months)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for what Germany was required to withdraw from, implying that they were occupying that area. Therefore, the answer is: areas controlled by Russia in 1914.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that underground leader Pi\u0142sudski returned to Warsaw on 11 November and set up what became the Second Polish Republic. \nThe answer: Pi\u0142sudski", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920, the huge Battle of Warsaw was fought.\" This means that the Polish-Bolshevik War was fought in 1920.\nThe answer: 1920", "{rule list: 2, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the army that Warsaw defended itself against, which is the Red Army. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"successfully,\" which implies that the Red Army was the opposing force. Rule 3 applies because the article mentions other armies, such as the Allied Armistice and the German army, but the question specifically asks for the army that Warsaw defended against. Rule 8 applies because the question uses the word \"against,\" which implies opposition. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"did,\" which implies a negation. \nThe answer: Red Army", "{1, 7, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the date of Germany's invasion of Poland, which is explicitly stated in the passage. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps us understand that \"start\" and \"begin\" are synonyms. Rule 7 is relevant because \"invade\" and \"attack\" are synonyms. Rule 10 is relevant because typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 is relevant because some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: September 1, 1939", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. First comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Warsaw came under the rule of the General Government after the German Invasion of Poland. In an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we know that Warsaw was under the rule of the General Government. \nThe answer: German Nazi colonial administration", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that Warsaw's entire Jewish population was several hundred thousand, which was about 30% of the city's population. Therefore, the answer is 30%.\nThe answer: 30%", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when Hitler ordered the annihilation of the Warsaw Ghetto, which is a specific event that happened at a specific time. The answer can be found in the passage, which states that the order came on April 19, 1943. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (the order) is acted upon the verb (came). Therefore, rule 23 applies, which states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Rule 17 also applies, as the question contains a negation (\"when did Hitler order the annihilation\"), which is important for understanding the answer.\nThe answer: April 19, 1943.", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"holding out\" is a form of resistance, and resistance is a measure of the ability to withstand an opposing force. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a duration, and the duration is a measure of time. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"able to hold out\"), which is important for determining the answer.\nThe answer: almost a month", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the Red Army was pursuing the Germans, indicating that the Germans were less successful in their military efforts. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the Red Army's actions, which is a different concept than the Polish government-in-exile or the Home Army. Rule 13 applies because the question specifically asks for the name of an army. \nThe answer: Red Army", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The exiled Polish government in London knew that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland, so they ordered the underground Home Army to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived. This is a case of negation being important for the answer. \nThe answer: To prevent the Red Army from taking control of Warsaw.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began.\" This means that the uprising began on August 1, 1944.\nThe answer: August 1, 1944", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the armed struggle was planned to last 48 hours but went on for 63 days, indicating a negation of the original plan. Rule 2 applies because the passage uses \"partially successful\" to describe the outcome of the uprising, indicating that it was not completely successful. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a specific number of days. \nThe answer: 63 days", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.\" This answer follows rule 3, which states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: between 150,000 and 200,000.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes how, after World War II, a Communist regime set up by the conquering Soviets initiated the \"Bricks for Warsaw\" campaign to address the housing shortage in the city. \nThe answer: \"Bricks for Warsaw\" campaign", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"large prefabricated housing projects\" being erected in Warsaw as part of the Bricks for Warsaw campaign. This refers to housing that was built using pre-made components that were assembled on site, rather than being built from scratch on site. The mention of \"large\" indicates that these were likely multi-unit buildings. Additionally, the passage notes that many historic buildings were restored, which suggests that the prefabricated housing was not historic in nature. \nThe answer: large prefabricated housing projects", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: typical buildings of an Eastern Bloc city", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Palace of Culture and Science was a gift from the Soviet Union.\nThe answer: Palace of Culture and Science", "{rule list: 14, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the list that Warsaw's Old Town was inscribed onto in 1980, which is a specific detail that requires knowledge of the context. Rule 14 states that locations are equally important for the answer, so the fact that the inscription was made onto a list is relevant. Rule 23 states that passive voice is used in the context, so the answer should reflect that. \nThe answer: UNESCO's World Heritage list", "{rule list: 13, 19}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a pope who was a native of Poland. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a name in the article. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we don't need to worry about whether the pope is male or female. \nThe answer: John Paul II", "{1, 2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The visits encouraged the growing anti-communist fervor and support for the budding solidarity movement in Poland. The use of \"encouraged\" implies a positive effect, so negations are not important. The answer is not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles. The answer is not affected by typos or contractions. The answer is not affected by irrelevant passages or names/locations. The answer is not affected by gender. The answer is not affected by the order of events. The answer is affected by the use of synonyms, so rule 7 is relevant. The answer is affected by negations, so rule 17 is relevant.\nThe answer: support for the budding solidarity movement and the growing anti-communist fervor", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that John Paul II visited his native country in 1979, less than a year after becoming pope.\nThe answer: less than a year", "{rule list: 16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the location mentioned last in the passage is the answer. The rule 13 states that \"names are equally important for the answer\", which means that the name of the location should be included in the answer.\nThe answer: Victory Square", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the incentive for democratic changes", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Warsaw is about 300 km (190 mi) from the Carpathian Mountains.\nThe answer: 300 km", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. We also use rule 10 to determine that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: 325", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the location of Warsaw, including its elevation and nearby geographic features. The relevant information is that Warsaw straddles the Vistula River.\nThe answer: Vistula River", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article provides information about the elevation of different points in Warsaw. The highest point on the left side of the city is 115.7 metres (379.6 ft) and the highest point on the right side is 122.1 metres (400.6 ft). Therefore, the answer is 122.1 metres. \nThe answer: 122.1 metres", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the elevation of different points in Warsaw. The question specifically asks for the location of the lowest point, which is given as \"at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw.\" \nThe answer: at the right bank of the Vistula, by the eastern border of Warsaw.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Warsaw is located on two main geomorphologic formations.\nThe answer: 2", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes two main geomorphologic formations in Warsaw: the plain moraine plateau and the Vistula Valley with its asymmetrical pattern of different terraces. The question specifically asks about the formation with the asymmetrical pattern of different terraces, which is the Vistula Valley. \nThe answer: Vistula Valley", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article describes two geomorphologic formations in Warsaw: the plain moraine plateau and the Vistula Valley. The left part of Warsaw is situated on both the moraine plateau and the Vistula terraces. Therefore, the answer is the plain moraine plateau. \nThe answer: plain moraine plateau", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how the Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, dividing the city into two parts, left and right. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any rules related to those concepts. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is relevant in understanding that the left part of Warsaw is mentioned before the right part. \nThe answer: the Vistula River", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any information related to those concepts. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that the edge of the moraine plateau is called Warsaw Escarpment.\nThe answer: Warsaw Escarpment", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: plain moraine plateau", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Vistula terraces as having different levels, and the highest one contains former flooded terraces. This indicates that the highest level of the Vistula plateau contains former flooded terraces.\nThe answer: former flooded terraces", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The currently flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground depressions with water systems coming from the Vistula old-riverbed. The use of \"still\" in the question indicates that the visibility of these features may have been expected to disappear over time, but they have not. The answer is valleys and ground depressions with water systems. \nThe answer: valleys and ground depressions with water systems", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the different patterns of geomorphological forms on the right side of Warsaw, including the presence of Aeolian sand with dunes. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore any irrelevant information about ponds and terraces. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can focus on the relevant information about the right side of Warsaw. \nThe answer: on the highest terrace on the right side of Warsaw, which is mainly forested areas (pine forest)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: pine forested areas", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country, including the destruction during World War II and the subsequent rebuilding efforts. \nThe answer: Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific event in the past, which requires understanding of tense and negation. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a statement that says Warsaw was completely destroyed. Rule 23 reminds us that passive voice is used to describe an action done to the subject, so we should look for a sentence in passive voice that describes the destruction of Warsaw. \nThe answer: During the Second World War.", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Warsaw was destroyed during the Second World War and rebuilding began after liberation. \"After liberation\" implies that the rebuilding started after the war ended, which comes after the destruction. Therefore, the answer is after 1945.\nThe answer: after liberation, which implies after 1945.", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s.\" Therefore, the answer is a building from the 19th century that was destroyed between the 1950s and 1960s, but it is not specified which one. \nThe answer: Not specified.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the residential blocks were erected with a basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries, indicating that the style was influenced by the architecture of the communist-ruled Eastern bloc. This is further supported by the fact that the passage contrasts these blocks with the historical buildings that were reconstructed after the war. \nThe answer: basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches. \nThe answer: Gothic architecture", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: St. John's Cathedral is a significant example of Gothic architecture in the city. It was constructed in the 14th century. The passage also mentions other notable buildings from different architectural styles, but the question specifically asks about the construction date of the cathedral. \nThe answer: 14th century", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the stylistic classification of St. John's Cathedral. Rule 3 states that style is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color, so those are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if St. John's Cathedral is an example of a certain style, then it is not an example of any other style. The answer: Masovian Gothic.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists several examples of different architectural styles, including Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist, and early Baroque. The question specifically asks about the house of the Baryczko merchant family, which is described as a notable example of Renaissance architecture.\nThe answer: Renaissance architecture", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists several examples of different architectural styles in the city, including Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist, and early Baroque. The question specifically asks about the Royal Castle, which is mentioned as the most interesting example of mannerist architecture in the city. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that mannerist architecture is a different concept than the other styles mentioned, and rule 16 to determine that the Royal Castle is the first structure of the early baroque style mentioned, making it the most interesting example of that style.\nThe answer: early baroque architecture", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that building activity occurred in the later decades of the 17th century and that examples of this architecture include Krasi\u0144ski Palace (1677\u20131683), Wilan\u00f3w Palace (1677\u20131696) and St. Kazimierz Church (1688\u20131692). Therefore, the answer is \"the 17th century\". \nThe answer: the 17th century", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage lists several examples of building activity in Warsaw during the later decades of the 17th century and the following centuries. St. Kazimierz Church is one of these examples, and it was built specifically between 1688 and 1692. The question asks for a specific time period, so rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant to identify the correct time frame. Rule 23 (active vs passive voice) is not relevant for this question.\nThe answer: between 1688 and 1692", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage lists examples of different architectural styles in Warsaw, and the question specifically asks for the type of architecture of the Palace of Four Windows. Therefore, irrelevant information can be ignored. The answer: rococo.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from age and color. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: neoclassical architecture", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the passage, the Palace on the Water is listed as the first example of neoclassical architecture, and it is later mentioned that it was rebuilt from 1775-1795.\nThe answer: 1775-1795", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the type of architecture is not related to any of these concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the Kronenberg Palace had been an exceptional example of a certain type of architecture, then it must have been destroyed or lost that status. Therefore, the answer is: The passage does not specify the type of architecture of the Kronenberg Palace.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is relevant because the passage mentions that some buildings were not restored or were rebuilt in a different style. \nThe answer: They were not restored by the communist authorities after the war or were rebuilt in socialist realism style.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Warsaw Philharmony edifice was rebuilt in socialist realism style. This information is relevant to the question because it directly answers what style the building was built in.\nThe answer: socialist realism", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage discusses various buildings in Warsaw that were not restored or were rebuilt in a different style after the war. It then mentions that the Warsaw University of Technology building is the most interesting example of late 19th-century architecture. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts like size, shape, age, and color, which are not interchangeable. Rule 12 is relevant because it allows us to ignore the irrelevant information about other buildings in the passage. \nThe answer: Warsaw University of Technology building", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Saxon Palace and Br\u00fchl Palace were \"the most distinctive buildings\" in prewar Warsaw, indicating that they were important landmarks or notable structures. This falls under the concept of \"shape\" (rule 3) and their importance is emphasized by the fact that the municipal government authorities have decided to rebuild them (indicating their significance). (rule 13)\nThe answer: distinctive buildings", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: many places, including Pawiak, the Warsaw Citadel, the statue of Little Insurgent, and the Warsaw Uprising Monument", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Pawiak", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 and 23. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the Warsaw Citadel was built after the November Uprising. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that the sentence \"The Warsaw Citadel, an impressive 19th-century fortification built after the defeat of the November Uprising\" is in the passive voice, and the subject \"Warsaw Citadel\" was acted upon the verb \"built\". \nThe answer: The Warsaw Citadel.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the children who served as messengers and frontline troops in the Warsaw Uprising", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the \"impressive Warsaw Uprising Monument\" which was \"erected in memory of the largest insurrection of World War II.\" This indicates that the monument in question is the Warsaw Uprising Monument.\nThe answer: Warsaw Uprising Monument", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the type of space that the Botanic Garden and University Library garden are. The answer is that they are green spaces. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so these are not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that they are called \"Botanic Garden\" and \"University Library garden\" is important to note. \nThe answer: green spaces", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a palm house in the New Orangery that displays plants of subtropics from all over the world.\nThe answer: the New Orangery", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Pole Mokotowskie is a big park in the northern Mokot\u00f3w where the first horse racetrack was located. The rule of location (16) helps us identify that the answer is referring to the northern part of Mokot\u00f3w.\nThe answer: Pole Mokotowskie", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions \"Park Ujazdowski (close to the Sejm and John Lennon street).\" This indicates that the park close to John Lennon street is Park Ujazdowski.\nThe answer: Park Ujazdowski", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that a zoological garden was established in the Praga Park in 1927.\nThe answer: 1927", "3, 8, 13\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding why Warsaw's flora is rich in species. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so these are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if Warsaw's flora is very rich in species, then it is not poor in species. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the specific location mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: Warsaw is located within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas as well as arable land, meadows, and forests.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Bielany Forest is located within the borders of Warsaw. This satisfies rule 3, which states that locations are important for the answer, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: within the borders of Warsaw", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Bielany Forest is the remaining part of the Masovian Primeval Forest, indicating that it is the last remnant of that forest.\nThe answer: The Masovian Primeval Forest", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Kabaty Forest", "{rule list: 3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: The article states that Warsaw has \"two botanic gardens\" located by the \u0141azienki park and by the Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin. The irrelevant information about the Bielany and Kabaty forests can be ignored.\nThe answer: 2", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides a specific number for the population of Warsaw in 1939, which is a size concept. The passage also provides a comparison between the population in 1939 and 1945, which follows the rule that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: c. 1,300,000", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that in 1939, 1,300,000 people lived in Warsaw, but by 1945, only 420,000 people lived there. This means that the number of people living in Warsaw had declined to 420,000 by 1945.\nThe answer: 420,000", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Warsaw area enlargement took place in 1951.\nThe answer: 1951", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding the belief that Varsovians thought of themselves as better than others. This is a negation, so rule 17 applies. Additionally, this belief is related to a perception of superiority, which is a comparison concept, so rule 3 applies. Finally, the question asks about a belief, which is a mental state, so rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: Many Poles believed that Varsovians thought of themselves as better than others.", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 17 is relevant because the question asks about the absence of a limitation, which is a negation. The rule 22 is relevant because the question asks about a change that occurred at a specific time. \nThe answer: residency registration", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Warsaw has been a multi-cultural city throughout its existence.\nThe answer: multi-cultural", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides the exact percentage breakdown of the religious affiliations of Warsaw's population in 1901, so we can use rule 3 to determine that the answer is not a color, shape, age, profession, nationality, animal, or vehicle. We can also use rule 16 to determine that the first piece of information given about the population is the total number of inhabitants. \nThe answer: 711,988", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"age, shape, size, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" is relevant because the question asks for the percentage of Catholics, which implies that the other percentages add up to 100%. Therefore, we can use the antonym of \"Catholic\" (non-Catholic) to calculate the answer. The answer is 43.8% (100% - 35.7% - 5% - 2.8%). \nThe answer: 56.2%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that religion is a different concept than nationality. We use rule 8 to infer that if the percentage of Catholics was 56.2%, then the percentage of Protestants was less than that. \nThe answer: 2.8%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Most of them were destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.\" This indicates that the destruction occurred after the uprising, which took place in 1944. Therefore, the answer is: after the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.", "3, 4\nExplanation: The article explains that the basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (gmina). It also clarifies that cities are also considered communes, but with a city charter. This information is covered by rules 3 and 4, which state that size and profession are different concepts. \nThe answer: commune (gmina)", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule about different concepts (3) is relevant because it distinguishes between the different levels of territorial division in Poland. The rule about profession and nationality (4) is not directly relevant, but it reinforces the idea that different concepts should not be confused. The rule about first and last (16) is relevant because it helps to identify the specific level of territorial division being referred to. \nThe answer: counties or powiats", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in Krak\u00f3w, the registration numbers for cars are of the same type for all districts. This means that there are no districts in Krak\u00f3w that have their own entitlements like car registration. Therefore, the answer can be found by applying rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) to identify that \"districts\" are the relevant concept, and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) to identify that Krak\u00f3w is the relevant location. \nThe answer: Krak\u00f3w", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Legislative power in Warsaw is vested in the unicameral Warsaw City Council (Rada Miasta).\nThe answer: Warsaw City Council", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Warsaw City Council comprises 60 members.\nThe answer: 60", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A happens every X, then A happens X times per Y, and rule 16, which states that \"every\" refers to a frequency. The answer can be found in the passage, which states that council members are elected directly every four years.\nThe answer: every four years", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to the question. The rule that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph is relevant because \"divides itself into\" is a synonym for \"is divided into.\" The answer is: committees.", "{7, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote. \nThe answer: 30 days", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article explains that in Poland, mayors of bigger cities are called presidents, and this includes Warsaw. Therefore, the answer is \"President.\" \nThe answer: President", "{1, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich.\nThe answer: Jan Andrzej Menich", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that Menich was the first President of Warsaw, and rule 23 to understand that the sentence \"The first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695-1696)\" is in the active voice, meaning that Menich served as President in 1695-1696.\nThe answer: 1695-1696", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Since 1990 the President of Warsaw had been elected by the City council.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that the subject (who is doing the electing) is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer from the context that the City council is the one doing the electing. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the most recent information is the most relevant. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to look for the agent of the action (who is doing the electing) in the context. \nThe answer: the City council", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the mayor of the district Centrum automatically was designated as the President of Warsaw\" between 1994 and 1999. This means that the district of Centrum chose the President during that time period.\nThe answer: Centrum", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Warsaw's city centre is called \"\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie\", which is a Polish word.\nThe answer: \"\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 304,016", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: emerging markets", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What percentage of Poland's national income does not come from Warsaw?\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the relevant information as \"Warsaw produces 12% of Poland's national income.\" \nThe answer: 12%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about them is not relevant to the answer. However, the passage provides specific information about the GDP of Warsaw in 2010, which is a numerical value. The passage also mentions that Warsaw's GDP per capita in 2010 was 111696 PLN. Using the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" we can determine that the answer is 191.766 billion PLN. \nThe answer: 191.766 billion PLN", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Warsaw's first stock exchange was established in 1817.\" \nThe answer: 1817", "{rule list: 3, 15}\nExplanation: The first stock exchange in Warsaw stopped trading during World War II.\nThe answer: World War II", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time when an event occurred, so rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant. The answer is also found in a passive sentence, so rule 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb) is also relevant. \nThe answer: April 1991", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that as of August 31, 2009, there were 374 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The relevant rules are 3 (size is a different concept) and 16 (dates are ordered chronologically). \nThe answer: 374", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR)", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that \"The FSO Car Factory was established in 1951.\"\nThe answer: 1951", "{3, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The rule about vehicles and animals being different concepts (rule 5) is important to note that the answer will be a vehicle, not an animal. The rule about first and last (rule 16) is important to identify that the car being referred to is the Polonez, as it is the last car model listed before the mention of other countries where it was assembled. The rule about shape, size, age, and color being different concepts is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: Polonez", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the South Korean car manufacturer that purchased the factory in 1995. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is important to focus on the nationality of the company. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the relevant information by looking for the first mention of a South Korean car manufacturer. \nThe answer: Daewoo", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific models of cars assembled at the factory are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the car manufacturers is relevant. First comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer is AvtoZAZ.\nThe answer: AvtoZAZ", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the license for the production of the Chevrolet Aveo", "{rule list: names and locations are equally important}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the Polish name of Warsaw, which is a location. Therefore, the answer must be in the Polish language, which is a name. \nThe answer: Warszawa", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from other types of information, and the question is asking for the largest city. The answer is Warsaw. \nThe answer: Warsaw", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the size and shape of Warsaw are irrelevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the Vistula River is located in Warsaw. \nThe answer: Vistula River", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the population of Warsaw is estimated at 1.740 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 2.666 million residents. This means that the greater metropolitan area has a population of 2.666 million residents.\nThe answer: 2.666 million residents", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article provides information about the population of Warsaw, stating that it is the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union. This answer is found by applying rule 3, which states that size and population are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: 9th", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the largest city of Poland, which is directly stated in the article as Warsaw. Rule 3 is relevant to ensure that size is not confused with other concepts such as shape or color. Rule 13 is relevant to ensure that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Warsaw", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"It stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland.\" Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific location feature (the river) and rule 12 applies because the rest of the information in the paragraph is irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Vistula River", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Warsaw is roughly 260 kilometres (160 mi) from the Baltic Sea.\nThe answer: 260 kilometres (160 mi)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule about size (3) applies because the question is asking about the number of residents, which is a measure of size. The rule about first and last (16) applies because the question is asking specifically about the greater metropolitan area. \nThe answer: 2.666 million residents", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" means that the population of Warsaw is a separate concept from its location or area. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" means that the ranking of Warsaw's population should come before any other information about its size or area. \nThe answer: 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that Normandy is a region in France, which means that it is located in France.\nThe answer: France", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that the Normans were in Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries. This is a straightforward answer that can be found by identifying the time period mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: 10th and 11th centuries", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"nationality and profession are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the Norse being from a certain profession. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" ensures that we are looking for the countries of origin of the Norse people. \nThe answer: Denmark, Iceland, and Norway.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article explains that the Normans were descended from Norse raiders and pirates, and their leader was Rollo. \nThe answer: Rollo", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: first half of the 10th century", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts eliminates any confusion about the term \"duke\" being a profession rather than a name. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first helps identify that the battle of Hastings occurred after the formation of the Duchy of Normandy. The answer is William the Conqueror. \nThe answer: William the Conqueror", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: We apply rule 3 to note that culture, military, and political impact are different concepts. We apply rule 4 to note that ruling and nationality are different concepts. We apply rule 16 to note that \"who\" refers to a person, and therefore, \"ruled\" refers to a person's profession. \nThe answer: Various rulers ruled the duchy of Normandy, including Richard I of Normandy and William the Conqueror.", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the Norman's nationality does not determine their religion. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the Normans were famed for their Christian piety, then their religion was not non-Christian. \nThe answer: Christian", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can infer that \"original meaning\" is a synonym for \"meaning\" in the context. \nThe answer: Norseman, Viking.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it helps us identify that \"recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century\" refers to the time period when the Latin version of the word Norman was first recorded. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" is relevant because the sentence \"Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century)\" is in passive voice. \nThe answer: The Latin version of the word Norman was first recorded in the 9th century.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Duchy of Normandy was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and Rollo, a Viking ruler. This implies that the Duchy of Normandy was founded in 911.\nThe answer: 911", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify who signed the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte with Rollo. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Rollo did not sign the treaty alone. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can identify the subject of the sentence by looking for the entity that is being acted upon. Therefore, the answer is: King Charles III of West Francia.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Duchy of Normandy was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and Rollo, and that the treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast. Therefore, the river that originally bounded the Duchy was the Epte.\nThe answer: Epte", "{3, 8, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking about who gave the original Viking settlers a common identity. This is a question about identity, which falls under rule 3. Rule 8 applies because the question contains a comparison between two entities (the original Viking settlers and the group that gave them a common identity). Rule 13 applies because names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Rollo", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the descendants of Rollo's Vikings replaced the Norse religion with Catholicism. Rule 3 applies because religion is a different concept from language and culture. Rule 4 applies because nationality is also a different concept from religion. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what is stated in the passage. \nThe answer: Catholicism", "{rule list: 3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Normans were located in the north of France, which is a location. This is supported by the fact that they blended their Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions to synthesize a unique \"Norman\" culture, which implies that they were in contact with the local people and their language. Therefore, rules 3, 4, and 16 are relevant.\nThe answer: North of France", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: fighting horsemen", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the attack occurred when Norman pilgrims were returning from Jerusalem, and that Prince Guaimar III begged them to stay. This implies that the attack and the meeting with Prince Guaimar III happened at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the attack occurred in 999.\nThe answer: 999", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"William of Apulia tells that, in 1016, Norman pilgrims to the shrine of the Archangel Michael at Monte Gargano were met by Melus of Bari...\" The name \"Archangel Michael\" refers to a person, so rule 13 applies. The question uses the phrase \"did the pilgrims go to\" which is a negation, so rule 17 applies. \nThe answer: The shrine of the Archangel Michael at Monte Gargano.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Norman pilgrims went to the shrine of the Archangel Michael at Monte Gargano in 1016. The question asks for the location of the shrine.\nThe answer: Monte Gargano", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the name Drogo comes after the Hauteville family. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that the subject of the sentence \"Henry III legally ennobled the Hauteville leader, Drogo\" is Henry III and the verb is \"ennobled\". \nThe answer: Drogo", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Guaimar IV of Salerno awarded the title of count to William Iron Arm in his capital of Melfi. Therefore, William Iron Arm was the Count of Melfi.\nThe answer: William Iron Arm", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Normans captured Sicily and Malta from the Saracens. This means that the Saracens controlled Sicily before the Normans.\nThe answer: The Saracens.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Roger II was crowned king in 1130, which directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 1130", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The location of William Iron Arm's castle is mentioned as Squillace, which is a specific place and therefore relevant to the answer. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Squillace", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"the great geographical treatises of the Middle Ages, the 'Tabula Rogeriana',\" and that it was written by al-Idrisi for King Roger II of Sicily. \nThe answer: Kitab Rudjdjar", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the \"Tabula Rogeriana\" was written by the Andalusian al-Idrisi for king Roger II of Sicily, and entitled \"Kitab Rudjdjar\" (\"The Book of Roger\"). \"Kitab Rudjdjar\" means \"The Book of Roger\" in English.\nThe answer: The Book of Roger", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The rules selected are to differentiate between concepts (3, 4, 5), and to consider the importance of names (13). The passage mentions that the Normans established a meritocratic bureaucracy of Jews, Muslims, and Christians, both Catholic and Eastern Orthodox. \nThe answer: a meritocratic bureaucracy of Jews, Muslims, and Christians, both Catholic and Eastern Orthodox.", "{3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Normans fighting against various groups in Italy, the Byzantine Empire, and Armenia, but does not specify a main enemy. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for specific names of groups or individuals mentioned in the passage. Finally, rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the Pechenegs, Bulgars, and Seljuk Turks were the Normans' enemies in that order. \nThe answer: The Normans fought against the Pechenegs, the Bulgars, and especially the Seljuk Turks.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1050s", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in the 1060s", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Afranji", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that a Norman named Oursel led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria. Therefore, Oursel was the leader when the Franks entered the Euphrates valley.\nThe answer: Oursel", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Turkish forces", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the origins of the Raouliii family, which is a concept related to their ancestry. Rule 3 states that concepts such as age and nationality are different from concepts such as size and shape, so we can focus on the former. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What were the ancestors of the Raouliii family?\".\nThe answer: They were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul.", "{rule list: names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a person, so the relevant rule is that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Robert Guiscard", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Normans attacked Dyrrachium after capturing other cities in Albania, and that the city's garrison resisted until February 1082 when it was betrayed to the Normans by Venetian and Amalfitan merchants. Therefore, the answer is February 1082.\nThe answer: February 1082", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Robert led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships.\nThe answer: 30,000", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Deabolis", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Robert's son is Bohemond, who commanded the Normans in the siege of Dyrrachium. Bohemond comes after Robert in the sentence, indicating that he is the son. This is an active sentence, where Bohemond is the subject and \"commanded\" is the verb.

The rule of \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" tells us that \"killing\" is a passive verb, and therefore Harold II is the object of the verb. \nThe answer: Harold II died at the Battle of Hastings.", "{rule list: 16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The subject \"Duke William II of Normandy\" acted the verb \"conquered\" and killed King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings.

Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that the Battle of Hastings happened before Duke William II of Normandy conquered England. Additionally, we can use rule 23 to determine that the Battle of Hastings is the event being acted upon by the verb \"killing\". \nThe answer: 1066", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Normans replaced the Anglo-Saxons as the ruling class of England, indicating that the Anglo-Saxons were the ruling class before them. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that the ruling class refers to a group of people with a certain profession or social status. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the ruling class mentioned first in the article refers to the ruling class ahead of the Normans. \nThe answer: Anglo-Saxons", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects and influenced it, helping in the development of Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English.

The subject is \"Bohemond of Taranto and his nephew Tancred,\" and we are looking for the name of Bohemond's nephew. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine that \"nephew\" comes after \"Bohemond\" in the sentence, and rule 23 to identify that \"Bohemond's nephew\" is the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: Tancred", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of Jerusalem.\nThe answer: Jerusalem", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Western Europe controlled Cyprus for 380 years.\nThe answer: 380 years", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Richard's fleet was dispersed by a storm, which is a passive sentence where the subject (the storm) acted upon the verb (dispersed).

His sister and his fianc\u00e9e Berengaria were discovered anchored on the south coast of Cyprus. On May 1, 1191, Richard's fleet arrived in the port of Limassol on Cyprus, where he took Limassol after Isaac Komnenos refused to release the prisoners and the treasure. Therefore, using rule 16, we know that Richard's sister came before his fianc\u00e9e in the passage. Using rule 23, we know that the subject of a passive sentence is acted upon the verb. Therefore, \"was anchored\" is a passive sentence, and \"his sister and his fianc\u00e9e Berengaria\" are the subjects. Thus, the answer is Berengaria. \nThe answer: Berengaria", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: No answer can be extracted from the given article as the year of the storm is not mentioned.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Richard the Lion-hearted landed in Cyprus in 1191 and encountered the island's despot Isaac Komnenos, who refused to release prisoners and treasure.

Therefore, we need to use rule 23 to understand that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. We also need to use rule 16 to understand that \"nephew\" comes after \"Jean.\" \nThe answer: Enrique P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 2nd Count de Niebla.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions two people, Jean Bethencourt and his nephew Maciot de Bethencourt.

The use of the word \"unique\" implies that this idiom is specific to Norman architecture and not found in other styles. Additionally, the use of \"idiom\" suggests a distinct style or characteristic. \nThe answer: rounded arches and massive proportions.", "{3}\nExplanation: The rule states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the type of arches is a different concept from other characteristics of Norman architecture mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: rounded arches", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article states that Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the Anglo-Saxon, so Norman architecture came after Anglo-Saxon architecture.\nThe answer: Anglo-Saxon", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the Anglo-Saxon\nThe answer: Anglo-Saxon architecture", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Norman-Arab architectural style was present within the Kingdom of Sicily. \nThe answer: Kingdom of Sicily", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in the early 11th century", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify who used the church to unify themselves, which implies that there were different groups or factions that needed to be brought together. Rule 1 helps us understand that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the question implies that the Normans were not initially unified, but they used the church to achieve this. Rule 4 helps us understand that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers that refer to a specific profession or job. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the use of negatives in the passage. The answer is: the Normans. \n\nThe answer: The Normans.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the French Wars of Religion occurred in the 16th century. The rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so we can extract the answer without confusion. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so we can assume that the French Wars of Religion happened before the French Revolution.\nThe answer: 16th century.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the Bayeux Tapestry is \"not a tapestry but a work of embroidery.\" This means that the needlework used in its creation was embroidery.\nThe answer: embroidery", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Norman art's most well-known piece is the Bayeux Tapestry.\nThe answer: Bayeux Tapestry", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux and first Earl of Kent", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that churches in southern Italy preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage.

Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"Under the Norman abbot Robert de Grantmesnil, several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy\" is in the active voice, so we know that the monks fled to southern Italy.\nThe answer: southern Italy", "{rule list: names and locations are equally important, first comes before last}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Saint-Evroul monks established a Latin monastery at Sant'Eufemia in southern Italy.\nThe answer: Sant'Eufemia", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the person who provided financial support to the monks in Italy.\nThe answer: Robert Guiscard", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: singing", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: This question is asking for a specific piece of information, the year of Nikola Tesla's birth.

Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks whether Tesla's experiments were high-voltage or low-voltage, implying that there are only two options. Therefore, we can use rule 8 to infer that if Tesla's experiments were high-voltage, then they were not low-voltage, and vice versa. The passage states that Tesla conducted high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments, so the answer is high-voltage. \nThe answer: high-voltage", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: Tesla conducted experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging.

Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Milutin Tesla is Nikola's father. Therefore, the answer is: Serbian Orthodox priest.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the name of Tesla's father, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the father's name will come before the mother's name. Rule 23 tells us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. In this case, the sentence \"Tesla was born on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 into a Serb family in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia)\" is in the passive voice, so we need to look for an active sentence that mentions Tesla's father.

This indicates that she had special abilities in crafting and memorization. \nThe answer: making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and memorizing Serbian epic poems.", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence\" means that his mother had more influence on his talents than his father. Rule 3 applies because \"talents\" and \"Serbian family\" are different concepts. Rule 13 applies because the answer requires identifying the source of Tesla's beliefs about his talents.\nThe answer: his mother's genetics and influence", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that siblings are a different concept than age or profession. We use rule 16 to determine that the number of siblings should be stated before their names. \nThe answer: Tesla had four siblings.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla studied German while in school.\nThe answer: German", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan in 1861, and then the family moved to Gospi\u0107. Therefore, the move to Gospi\u0107 must have occurred after 1861, but the article does not provide a specific year. However, since the article mentions that Tesla attended the \"Lower Real Gymnasium\" after completing primary school, we can infer that the move to Gospi\u0107 must have occurred before Tesla started attending that school.

Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we can infer that the company he returned to is the same one he worked for when he first arrived in Budapest. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can look for a sentence in the passive voice that describes the company becoming functional. The sentence \"Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position\" fits this criteria. \nThe answer: Budapest Telephone Exchange", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position at the Budapest Telephone Exchange.\nThe answer: Chief electrician", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the given passage, the first event mentioned is Tesla beginning to work for the Continental Edison Company in France in 1882.\nThe answer: 1882", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 applies because \"France\" comes before \"New York City\" in the timeline of events.

Rule 2 applies because the sentence also implies that Tesla was in the least favorable financial situation possible, having to work low-paying jobs and questioning the value of his education. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about Tesla's financial situation after being forced out, implying that he was in a worse financial situation than before. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about Tesla's financial situation after being forced out, implying a negation of his financial situation being good. \nThe answer: Tesla was left penniless.", "{rule list: 3, 15}\nExplanation: Tesla worked as a ditch digger for $2 per day.\nThe answer: worked as a ditch digger", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: Tesla referred to the winter of 1886/1887 as a time of \"terrible headaches and bitter tears.\"\nThe answer: 1886/1887", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: assigned them to the company in lieu of stock", "{rule list: 3, 15}\nExplanation: Tesla worked as a ditch digger for $2 per day.\nThe answer: ditch digger", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Tesla had to work at various electrical repair jobs and even as a ditch digger for $2 per day.\nThe answer: Tesla worked at various electrical repair jobs and even as a ditch digger for $2 per day.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Alfred S.

Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they should not be confused with each other. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which can help identify the relevant information in the passage. \nThe answer: a commutator", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the answer is related to the concept of maintenance, which is different from the concept of design. Therefore, the absence of a commutator in Tesla's design avoided sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.\nThe answer: sparking and high maintenance", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the design of the motor developed by Tesla. This falls under the concept of \"shape\" (rule 3) and not \"profession\" or \"nationality\" (rule 4). Therefore, the answer should describe the physical design of the motor. The passage states that the motor was a \"simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator\" (emphasis added), indicating that the motor did not have a commutator. \nThe answer: The motor was a design without a commutator.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in 1887", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that AC electricity was gaining popularity because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. This means that it was more efficient than DC electricity for transmitting power over long distances.

In this case, the answer is \"commutator\", which is a mechanical part that Tesla's AC motor did not require, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes. \"Mechanical brushes\" is the antonym of \"commutator\", and since the question asks for the part that the motor did not require, we need to apply rule 8 to get the answer \"commutator\". \nThe answer: commutator", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla patented the motor in May 1888.\nThe answer: May 1888", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Thomas Commerford Martin was the editor of Electrical World magazine and a friend and publicist of Tesla.\nThe answer: editor of Electrical World magazine", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The IEEE is the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, which is now known as IEEE.\nThe answer: The American Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1888", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer involves the reason why Westinghouse did not secure a patent for a similar motor. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is also not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is relevant because the question asks why Westinghouse did not secure a patent for a similar motor, implying that Tesla had already secured a patent for his AC motor. Therefore, the answer is that Westinghouse decided Tesla's patent would probably control the market. \n\nThe answer: Tesla's patent would probably control the market.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Thomas Commerford Martin", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the editor of Electrical World magazine, which is a name and therefore equally important to the answer. The first name mentioned in the sentence is \"Thomas Commerford Martin,\" which is the first name and therefore comes before the last name. \nThe answer: Thomas Commerford Martin", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the person or entity that wanted to acquire patents for an AC motor. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that Thomas Commerford Martin is described as an editor. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that \"Westinghouse\" refers to George Westinghouse. The answer is: George Westinghouse.", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Westinghouse considered Galileo Ferraris for the patents, but decided Tesla's patent would probably control the market.\nThe answer: Galileo Ferraris", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Galileo Ferraris was an Italian physicist who presented a paper on a commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor in March 1888, which was similar to Tesla's AC motor. However, Westinghouse decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market, so he did not pursue a patent on Ferraris' motor. \nThe answer: Italian physicist", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of George Westinghouse's company, which is a profession and not a location or a person's name. Therefore, we apply rule 4 to distinguish between profession and nationality. We also apply rule 16 to determine that the company's name comes after the person's name. \nThe answer: Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the licensing deal was negotiated in July 1888. \nThe answer: 1888", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Westinghouse paid $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor to license Tesla's designs. \nThe answer: $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor.", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 applies because \"July 1888\" comes before \"Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year\". The rule 20 applies because \"Tesla\" is a male name and \"he\" refers to male names.\nThe answer: George Westinghouse", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla was hired as a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.\nThe answer: consultant", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The rule \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because the question asks for the amount paid, which is a numerical value. The rule \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the question asks for the amount paid, and the passage states that Westinghouse paid $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. \nThe answer: $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that \"July 1888\" comes before any other date mentioned in the article. The rule 22 helps us understand that \"Brown and Peck\" are the former and \"Westinghouse\" is the latter. \nThe answer: July 1888", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to find Tesla's monthly consultant salary, which is given as $2,000. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the $2,000 salary refers to Tesla and not to anyone else mentioned in the sentence. Rule 23 tells us that passive voice is important, but there is no passive voice in this sentence. Therefore, we only need to apply rule 16 to get the answer.\nThe answer: $2,000", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the location where Tesla worked as a consultant for Westinghouse. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that \"Pittsburgh\" is the last location mentioned in the sentence and is therefore the answer. Rule 23, which states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: Pittsburgh", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Pittsburgh", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Tesla worked on creating an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars in Pittsburgh in 1888, but they ended up using a DC traction motor instead.\nThe answer: creating an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 60-cycle", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to establish that the type of motor is a different concept from its size, shape, age, or color. Rule 4 tells us that profession is a different concept from nationality. Rule 16 establishes that \"they\" refers to the group of engineers working with Tesla. \nThe answer: a DC traction motor", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla helped create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars in Pittsburgh, but they ended up using a DC traction motor instead because Tesla's induction motor could only run at a constant speed. This means that Tesla's AC system was not used for streetcars in Pittsburgh. Therefore, rule 8 applies, and we can infer that the answer is \"not for streetcars\". \nThe answer: not for streetcars", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the type of system used for the streetcars is a different concept than Tesla's AC system. We use rule 4 to determine that the profession of the engineers and Tesla's nationality are different concepts. We use rule 8 to determine that since Tesla's system was not used, the system used instead is more antonym(AC) than Tesla's system. \nThe answer: a DC traction motor", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The \"War of Currents\" was an electrical distribution battle being waged between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse. \"Being waged\" implies an ongoing conflict, so the answer is both Edison and Westinghouse.\nThe answer: Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: A competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: AC development", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts and first coming before last indicate that the question is asking about a company that took over Edison Machine Works. The rule about size, shape, age, and color being different concepts is irrelevant. The answer is General Electric. \nThe answer: General Electric", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions a \"War of Currents\" between Thomas Edison's direct current (DC) and George Westinghouse's alternating current (AC), and Tesla's induction motor put him on the AC side. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about current type, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about Tesla's preference for AC, which implies that there was a choice between AC and another type of current. \nThe answer: alternating current (AC)", "{1, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes the relationship between Westinghouse and his rival. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is important in identifying Westinghouse's rival. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms in the question. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of names in the answer.\nThe answer: Thomas Edison", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes the \"War of Currents\" between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, which had been simmering since Westinghouse's first AC system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888. Therefore, the peak of the rivalry between Westinghouse and Edison was in 1888.\nThe answer: 1888.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the development of Tesla's AC motor had to be put on hold due to the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring engineers needed to build a completely integrated AC system. This delay was caused by the competition between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse in the \"War of Currents.\" \nThe answer: financial strain caused by competition in the \"War of Currents\"", "{16, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who took control of Edison's company. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the sentence mentioning Edison's company being consolidated into General Electric comes after the sentence mentioning Edison no longer being in control. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, and the question is asking for the person who took control, so the answer is that no one took control of Edison's company, as it was consolidated into General Electric. \nThe answer: No one took control of Edison's company, as it was consolidated into General Electric.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: George Westinghouse", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The location of the event is a specific piece of information that can be extracted from the passage, and names and locations are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Chicago", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The article states that George Westinghouse beat out a General Electric bid by one million dollars to light the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current.\nThe answer: General Electric", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying what Tesla called his electrical effects in 1893, which is a specific detail mentioned in the passage. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) is relevant to ensure that the answer is not confused with other concepts mentioned in the passage. Rule 7 (synonyms) is also relevant as the question may contain synonyms for \"electrical effects.\" Finally, rule 13 (names are important) is relevant as the answer specifically refers to Tesla's work. \nThe answer: the \"Tesla Polyphase System\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding that Tesla used high-frequency, high-voltage alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so \"low-frequency\" is the antonym of \"high-frequency\". Therefore, the answer is \"Tesla lit a wireless gas-discharge lamp using a high-frequency, high-voltage alternating current.\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: George Westinghouse", "{rule list: 13, 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the location of the World's Columbian Exposition. Rule 13 states that locations are equally important for the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, but it is not relevant to this question.\nThe answer: Chicago", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The answer requires knowledge of a specific year, which can be found by identifying the event being asked about and extracting the relevant information. Rule 16 helps to determine the order of events and identify which one is being referred to, while rule 22 helps to clarify which event is being referred to when multiple events are mentioned.\nThe answer: 1893", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Westinghouse won the bid to light the World's Columbian Exposition with alternating current, then the answer to the question is that the power displayed at the fair was alternating current. \nThe answer: alternating current", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the person who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company in 1893. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the person. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that \"Richard Dean Adams\" is the name of the person who headed the company. \nThe answer: Richard Dean Adams", "{rule list: 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a landmark that was discussed in regards to electricity in 1893. The passage mentions that Richard Dean Adams sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls, referring to Niagara Falls. Therefore, the answer is Niagara Falls. \nThe answer: Niagara Falls", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Westinghouse Electric", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: General Electric", "{1, 2, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares different systems proposed for transmitting power generated at Niagara Falls. Rule 2 applies because Tesla recommended a specific system (two-phase) as the most reliable. Rule 7 applies because the question asks for the specific type of system recommended. Rule 13 applies because the names of the companies involved are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Two-phase system", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer is a person's name, which is important for the answer (rule 13). The question asks for the head of the company, which implies a leadership position (rule 4). The passage states that Richard Dean Adams headed up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, indicating that he was the head of the company (rules 16 and 23).\nThe answer: Richard Dean Adams", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: In 1893.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Tesla suggested a specific type of system (two-phase) as being the most reliable, implying that other systems were less reliable. Rule 3 applies because the type of system (two-phase) is a different concept from the other systems that were proposed. \nThe answer: Tesla suggested a two-phase system.", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable. Therefore, the advantage of the two-phased system is its reliability. \nThe answer: reliability", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from size, shape, and color, so it is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that General Electric was involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric in the mid-1890s before the patent-sharing agreement was signed in 1896. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896\" is in the passive voice, so we need to reverse the subject and object to get the active voice: \"the two companies signed a patent-sharing agreement in 1896.\" \nThe answer: 1896", "{rule list: 2, 8, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The answer is a specific amount of money that Tesla received for selling his AC patents to Westinghouse Electric. Rules 2 and 8 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and antonyms, respectively, which may be present in the question or article. Rule 12 is relevant because irrelevant information may be present in the article. Rule 13 is relevant because names are important for the answer.\nThe answer: $216,000", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the royalty amount that Tesla had been receiving was \"an estimated $2.50 per AC horsepower.\" Rule 2 applies because \"overly generous\" implies that the royalty amount was more than it should have been, making $2.50 the antonym of \"overly generous.\" Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the antonym of \"overly generous.\" \nThe answer: $2.50 per AC horsepower", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of money received by Tesla, Brown, and Peck in royalties and licenses over the patents. The passage states that at that point, Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to them. The word \"estimated\" implies that the exact amount is not known, so we cannot give a specific number. However, we can infer from the passage that the amount was at least $200,000. Therefore, the answer is \"at least $200,000\".", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the financier who backed General Electric in their takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. Rule 1 applies because it helps us understand that if A is backed by B, then B is the one who is providing the financial support. Rule 4 applies because it helps us understand that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can focus on identifying the financier rather than their nationality or profession. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"who financed\") which is important for understanding that we need to identify the entity that provided the financial support. \nThe answer: J. P. Morgan", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We apply rule 3 to determine that \"licenses and royalties\" are different concepts. Then we apply rule 8 to infer that if Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck, then Tesla, Brown, and Peck had received more than $200,000. \nThe answer: more than $200,000.", "{1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage mentions that Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck, indicating that the patents were a financial strain on the company. Rule 2 applies because the passage states that the licensing agreement was replaced with a lump sum payment of $216,000, indicating that the lump sum was more than the previous royalties. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the amount Westinghouse paid, and the answer is $216,000. \nThe answer: $216,000", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: This rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article states that Tesla became a naturalized citizen on July 30, 1891, and then mentions his age of 35. Therefore, we can conclude that Tesla was 35 years old when he became a US citizen.\nThe answer: 35", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 applies because the question asks for the location of Tesla's laboratory, which is a spatial concept. Rule 23 applies because the sentence is in the active voice, and the subject (Tesla) is the one who established the laboratory. \nThe answer: Tesla's laboratory was established at South Fifth Avenue and later at 46 E. Houston Street, in New York.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: electric lamps", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla coil. This is a straightforward answer extraction task that only requires understanding the meaning of the sentence.\nThe answer: the Tesla coil", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the question asks for the time when Tesla became a US citizen, which is a comparison of before and after he obtained the citizenship. The rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific time. \nThe answer: 30 July 1891", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"In the same year, he patented the Tesla coil\" directly answers the question.\nThe answer: the Tesla coil", "{rule list: 16, 10}\nExplanation: We need to extract the age of Tesla when he became a citizen of the US. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the date of becoming a citizen comes after the mention of Tesla's age. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the fact that \"US\" is not capitalized. \nThe answer: 35", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Tesla demonstrated the potential of wireless power transmission, which is a type of power transmission that does not involve wires. This fits with rule 3, which states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 5, which states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. \nThe answer: wireless power transmission", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla served as vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.\nThe answer: American Institute of Electrical Engineers", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which means that the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers are two different entities. Therefore, we need to focus on the second part of the sentence, which mentions the Institute of Radio Engineers as the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can directly answer \"the Institute of Radio Engineers\". \nThe answer: the Institute of Radio Engineers", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We can use rule 16 to determine that Tesla stopped serving as vice president after 1894. We can then use rule 23 to understand that the sentence is in the active voice, meaning that Tesla stopped serving rather than being stopped from serving. \nThe answer: after 1894", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla held the position of vice president.\nThe answer: vice president.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that Tesla held the position of vice president before the year 1894. We use rule 23 to understand that the sentence is in the active voice, meaning that Tesla was the one who held the position. \nThe answer: from 1892 to 1894", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the American Institute of Electrical Engineers was the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE, along with the Institute of Radio Engineers. This means that the Institute of Radio Engineers eventually became the IEEE along with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.\nThe answer: Institute of Radio Engineers", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla began investigating \"radiant energy of 'invisible' kinds\" after noticing damaged film in his laboratory. This implies that he was interested in energy that was not visible to the naked eye. Therefore, rules 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A) and 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) are relevant. Rule 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph) may also be relevant in understanding that \"invisible energy\" is synonymous with \"energy that was not visible to the naked eye.\" \nThe answer: Because he noticed damaged film in his laboratory from energy that was not visible to the naked eye.", "{1, 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it helps us understand that the loss of data and tools was a negative event for Tesla. Rule 3 applies because it helps us understand that the type of experiments Tesla was conducting was with Crookes tubes, not with X-rays. Rule 12 applies because it helps us understand that the relevant information is about the loss of data and tools in the lab fire, not about Tesla's early experiments. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about an event that caused a loss, and the answer is that a lab fire caused Tesla to lose his data and tools. \n\nThe answer: A lab fire caused Tesla to lose his data and tools.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so the fact that Tesla's potential X-ray discovery predates R\u00f6ntgen's discovery by a few weeks is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer is December 1895, the date of R\u00f6ntgen's announcement. \nThe answer: December 1895", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the metal locking screw on the camera lens", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Tesla began investigating \"radiant energy of 'invisible' kinds\" in 1894, as stated in the article. The word \"invisible\" implies that this energy was not visible to the naked eye, which is a different concept from visible energy. The use of the word \"after\" in the question implies that there was a specific event that prompted Tesla's investigation, but there is no such event mentioned in the article. Therefore, rule 8 applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The question can be rephrased as \"When did Tesla begin investigating radiant energy that was not visible to the naked eye?\".\nThe answer: In 1894.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla referred to the energy as \"invisible\" and later it was identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-Rays\". Therefore, the answer is X-Rays.\nThe answer: X-Rays", "{1, 12, 13, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between Tesla's early research and the laboratory fire. Rule 12 applies because it specifies that irrelevant information should be ignored. Rule 13 applies because it establishes that names are important for the answer. Rule 16 applies because it establishes an order between Tesla's early research and the laboratory fire. \nThe answer: It was lost in the 5th Avenue laboratory fire of March 1895.", "{3, 7, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about the type of image that Tesla accidentally took, which is described as \"an X-ray image\" in the article. The article also mentions that this image was taken a few weeks prior to Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen's announcement of the discovery of X-rays. Therefore, rules 3 (different concepts), 7 (synonyms), 10 (typos), and 17 (negations) are relevant. \nThe answer: X-ray image", "{7, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Tesla was trying to photograph Mark Twain when he accidentally took the X-ray image. Gender is irrelevant to the answer. The name \"Mark Twain\" is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Mark Twain", "{rule list: 23, 24}\nExplanation: The passage describes Tesla's experiments in X-ray imaging, which he began in March 1896 after hearing about Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen's discovery. Tesla developed his own vacuum tube design that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil, and he devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. \nThe answer: X-ray imaging", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a specific time frame, and negations are important for the answer. Rule 22 is relevant because the question asks for a specific event in Tesla's life. \nThe answer: March 1896", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen discovered X-ray and X-ray imaging, and later on, Tesla did his own experiments in X-ray imaging. Therefore, X-ray imaging is the same as radiography. \nThe answer: radiography", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Tesla designed several experimental setups to produce X-rays.\nThe answer: X-rays", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: the Tesla Coil", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time when Tesla started deliberately experimenting with X-ray imaging. The passage provides the answer in the first sentence of the second paragraph, which is in the past tense and active voice: \"In March 1896, after hearing of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging.\" This sentence follows the active voice rule (23) and the negation rule (17) since it specifies that Tesla did experiment with X-ray imaging. \nThe answer: March 1896", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from what powered Tesla's high energy terminal vacuum tube. Animals and vehicles are different concepts from what powered Tesla's high energy terminal vacuum tube.\nThe answer: the output of the Tesla Coil", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen and were known as Roentgen rays at the time. Rule 2 applies because \"X-rays\" and \"Roentgen rays\" are synonyms. Rule 8 applies because \"Roentgen rays\" is the antonym of \"ordinary apparatus.\"\nThe answer: Roentgen rays", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the answer is that Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, when in fact they are transverse waves. Therefore, the correct answer is: Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, nitrous acid.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Tesla believed that nitrous acid contributed to the skin damage caused by working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. This contradicts the belief that the damage was caused by the Roentgen rays. \nThe answer: the skin damage caused by working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices.\nThe answer: circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Plasma waves occur in force-free magnetic fields.\nThe answer: force-free magnetic fields", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla believed that damage to the skin was not caused by X-rays, but by ozone generated in contact with the skin and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. This means that he did not think X-rays were the main cause of skin damage. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) and rule 8 (antonyms) are relevant. \nThe answer: ozone generated in contact with the skin", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"shape\" is a different concept from \"age\" and \"color\" and the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A apply here. Tesla mistakenly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, but they are actually transverse waves. Therefore, the answer is that Tesla mistakenly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Longitudinal waves are found in plasmas, according to Tesla's incorrect belief. The rule of concept differentiation (3) is relevant to distinguish between the concept of longitudinal waves and other types of waves. The rule of antonyms (8) is relevant to understand that if Tesla believed X-rays were longitudinal waves, then they are not transverse waves. \nThe answer: plasmas", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices and attributed the skin damage to various causes. It also mentions that he believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Therefore, the answer can be found in Tesla's notes or writings.\nThe answer: Tesla's notes or writings", "{1, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Benjamin Lamme made the induction motor more efficient.\nThe answer: Benjamin Lamme", "{rule list: 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"At the beginning of 1893\" provides the time frame for the event in question.\nThe answer: 1893", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Westinghouse Electric", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of Tesla's device, which is directly stated in the passage as \"the Egg of Columbus.\"\nThe answer: Egg of Columbus", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The subject of the sentence is \"Tesla\" and the verb is \"explained.\" The object of the sentence is \"the principles of the rotating magnetic field in an induction motor.\" The phrase \"by demonstrating how to make a copper egg stand on end using a device he constructed known as the Egg of Columbus\" is a modifier that describes how Tesla explained the principles. This is a passive sentence, so the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, the Egg of Columbus was demonstrated by Tesla.\nThe answer: Tesla", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: July 11, 1934", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The particle broke off the cathode, passed out of the tube, and physically struck Tesla, causing a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body and again at the place where it passed out.\nThe answer: The particle physically struck Tesla and caused a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body and again at the place where it passed out.", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for how Tesla knew he was being struck by the particle, which implies that there may have been some doubt or uncertainty about whether he was actually being struck. Rules 17 and 18 state that negations in both the question and the context are important for the answer. In this case, the negation is implied by the question itself, as it asks for how Tesla knew he was being struck, rather than assuming that he was being struck. Therefore, the answer must address this doubt or uncertainty. \nThe answer: Tesla could feel a sharp stinging pain where the particle entered and exited his body.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: bits of metal projected by his \"electric gun\"", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the association where Tesla demonstrated his radio wave theories, which is the object of the preposition \"to\" in the sentence. Therefore, we need to look for a passive sentence where Tesla is the subject and the association is the object of the preposition \"to\". Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a positive statement. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to look for a sentence where Tesla is the subject and the association is the object of the preposition \"to\". The sentence \"Tesla's theories on the possibility of the transmission by radio waves go back as far as lectures and demonstrations in 1893 in St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the National Electric Light Association\" fits these criteria. \nThe answer: National Electric Light Association.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. The answer to the question is the Tesla Coil, which is an invention and therefore falls under the category of \"different concepts\" from radio, which is a technology. Therefore, the answer is not related to size, shape, age, color, animals, or vehicles.", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: Tesla gave a demonstration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Franklin Institute.\nThe answer: Franklin Institute", "{rule list: 12, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Tesla demonstrated his radio-controlled boat to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden in 1898.

Rule 1 applies because the question uses the phrase \"type of animal\" which is a synonym for \"trained monkey\" mentioned in the article. Rule 7 applies because the question uses the phrase \"type of animal\" which is a synonym for \"animal\" mentioned in the article. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a negation (\"did not\" show interest) which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: trained monkey", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla was granted patents for a \"system of transmitting electrical energy\" and \"an electrical transmitter\" in 1900. This is in the past tense and is an active sentence, indicating that Tesla attained his electrical transmitter patent in 1900.\nThe answer: 1900", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the first person to achieve a certain feat. Rule 8 applies because the question contains a comparison between Marconi and Tesla. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: Guglielmo Marconi", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1901", "{16, 23, 24} and {rationale}\nExplanation: The passage describes a series of patent battles over radio technology involving Tesla and Marconi. In 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. This decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, but rather restored the prior patents of the other inventors. Therefore, rules 16, 23, and 24 are relevant as they establish the order of events and clarify the passive voice used in the passage. \nThe answer: 1943.", "{23, 24, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a decision that restored Tesla's patents, indicating that they were previously lost or invalidated. This suggests that there was some legal or regulatory action involved, which is covered by rules 23 and 24. Additionally, the use of the word \"restored\" implies that the patents were previously held by Tesla, but then taken away, indicating a negation, which is covered by rule 17. \nThe answer: Supreme Court of the United States", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Tesla moved to Colorado Springs \"On 17 May 1899\" according to the article.\nThe answer: 1899", "{3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the location where Tesla claimed he would transport energy to. Rule 3 tells us that concepts like location are different from concepts like size or shape. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important for the answer. Therefore, we need to look for a location that Tesla claimed he would transport energy to. \nThe answer: Paris", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies here, as the question is asking for a specific date. \nThe answer: 15 June 1899", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: five inches long", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Tesla was investigating atmospheric electricity, which is mentioned in the first sentence of the passage. The question asks for the \"kind\" of electricity, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so \"kind\" can be interpreted as a different concept from \"atmospheric.\" Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"kind\" can be interpreted as a synonym for \"nature.\" Therefore, the answer is \"the nature of atmospheric electricity.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is relevant as it clarifies that the answer cannot be a type of wave that is associated with animals or vehicles. Rule 8 is also relevant as it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if Tesla observed stationary waves, then he claimed to not observe moving waves. \nThe answer: stationary waves", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Tesla believed that the Earth had a resonant frequency, which was confirmed by his observations of stationary waves from lightning storms. This idea suggests that the Earth is capable of resonating like a musical instrument. \nThe answer: The Earth has a resonant frequency.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Tesla produced artificial lightning, which is a type of electrical discharge that resembles natural lightning. Therefore, the answer is lightning. \nThe answer: lightning", "{rule 2, rule 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the discharges were \"up to 135 feet long,\" so the answer is \"up to 135 feet.\" \nThe answer: up to 135 feet", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The passage states that the thunder from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in Cripple Creek, Colorado. This indicates that the distance from which the artificial thunder could be heard was significant.\nThe answer: 15 miles", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off.\" This means that the light bulbs were affected by the artificial lightning produced by the subject. Therefore, the answer is: They glowed even when turned off.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes how butterflies were electrified and had blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings.\nThe answer: They were electrified and had blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Tesla faulted a power station generator, causing a power outage.\nThe answer: a power outage", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: They were repeatedly burned out.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: powerful high frequency currents set up in them", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: destroyed it", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: communications from another planet", "{rule list: 1, 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that reporters treated Tesla's observation of unusual signals as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion that he was hearing signals from Mars. However, Tesla himself did not immediately conclude that the signals were from Mars and later expanded on the possibility that they could come from Venus or other planets. The use of the word \"did not\" in the question indicates a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Mars", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Collier's Weekly", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Signals from Marconi's European experiments or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: July 1899", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: John Jacob Astor IV provided Tesla with $100,000.\nThe answer: $100,000.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Astor invested $100,000 for Tesla to further develop and produce a new lighting system, indicating that he expected the money to be used for that purpose. However, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments, which goes against Astor's expectations. Therefore, the negation in the question is important for the answer.\nThe answer: develop and produce a new lighting system", "{rule list: 15}\nExplanation: Astor invested money for Tesla to develop a new lighting system, but Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments.\nThe answer: Tesla spent Astor's money on funding his Colorado Springs experiments.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states \"In 1899\" which indicates the year when Astor provided the money.\nThe answer: 1899", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage explicitly states \"On 7 January 1900, Tesla left Colorado Springs.\"\nThe answer: 7 January 1900", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla's lab was torn down in 1904 and its contents were sold two years later to satisfy a debt. This information directly answers the question.\nThe answer: It was torn down and its contents were sold.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage directly states that Tesla's lab was torn down in 1904. The question asks for when it was destroyed, which can be interpreted as asking for the same information. Therefore, the answer is 1904. \nThe answer: 1904", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the lab was torn down and its contents were sold to satisfy a debt. \nThe answer: They were sold to satisfy a debt.", "{rule list: 5, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla established the trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility known as Wardenclyffe near Shoreham, Long Island.\nThe answer: Wardenclyffe", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage describes Wardenclyffe as a \"trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility.\" This indicates that it was a facility for wireless communication over long distances, rather than a physical object like an animal or vehicle.\nThe answer: a trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found directly in the sentence \"the trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility known as Wardenclyffe near Shoreham, Long Island.\"\nThe answer: Shoreham, Long Island", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Tesla approached Morgan\nThe answer: Morgan", "{rule list: 8, 17}\nExplanation: Tesla blamed the Panic of 1901, which he claimed was caused by Morgan.\nThe answer: the Panic of 1901", "{rule list: 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 8 applies because the question asks about Morgan's reaction to Tesla's request, implying that Morgan did not grant the request. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about Morgan's specific reaction, implying that there may have been other reactions that are not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds.", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla wrote over 50 letters to Morgan in the five years following 1901.\nThe answer: over 50", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is irrelevant that Morgan is a financier. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the question asks for the reason why Tesla wanted funds, so the answer is that he was \"pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe.\" \nThe answer: to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, terminating Tesla's relationship with Morgan. This is a passive sentence, so we need to identify the subject and the verb. The subject is Marconi and the verb is transmitted. \nThe answer: Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the tower was erected to its full 187 feet (57 m).\" This indicates that the ultimate height of the tower was 187 feet.\nThe answer: 187 feet (57 m)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so we cannot assume that the answer is \"200\". Rule 8 tells us that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A, and A has less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, since we know that Tesla's bladeless turbine had 200 horsepower, we can say that it had less than 5000 horsepower, which is the upper limit given in the article. Thus, the answer is 200.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla's turbine operated at 16,000 rpm.\nThe answer: 16,000 rpm", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that Tesla demonstrated his turbine on his 50th birthday in 1906.\nThe answer: 1906", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the horsepower, which is a measure of power, and the passage compares the turbines in terms of their horsepower. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific characteristic of the turbines, which is their horsepower, and the passage does not mention anything about their size, shape, age, or color.\nThe answer: 100-5,000 hp", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla invented a steam-powered mechanical oscillator.\nThe answer: steam power", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the location of the lab where Tesla worked on the oscillators should come before any other information about the experiment. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that we should look for the active sentence that mentions the location of the lab. \nThe answer: at his Houston Street lab", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the problem that caused Tesla to hit his experiment with a sledgehammer, which implies that there was a problem or danger. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the experiment's size, shape, or color. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the danger or problem is the opposite of what caused the resonance, so we need to look for information about what caused the resonance. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative words that indicate a problem or danger. \nThe answer: He realized the danger of the experiment.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: World Today", "{1, 2, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the danger of the experiment to the danger of the police arriving. Rule 2 applies because the article describes the danger as \"belatedly realizing\" and \"forced to use a sledge hammer,\" indicating that the danger was significant. Rule 3 applies because the danger is related to the experiment and not the color, size, shape, or age of anything. Rule 7 applies because the question contains a synonym for \"danger.\" Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: Tesla claimed that his resonant frequencies could \"practically destroy civilization.\"", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Tesla believed that the application of electricity to the brain could enhance intelligence.\nThe answer: Electricity", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: The answer refers to Tesla's plan to enhance intelligence in students. Rule 1 applies because \"bright\" implies a comparison of intelligence levels. Rule 3 applies because the answer should focus on the specific plan, rather than general concepts like \"electricity\" or \"intelligence.\" Rule 7 applies because the question uses the synonym \"bright\" instead of \"intelligent.\" \nThe answer: Tesla's plan was to saturate the schoolroom with electricity to enhance the intelligence of dull students.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who approved the plan to use electricity to enhance intelligence in a schoolroom. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer will not be related to a profession. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that William H. Maxwell is a person's name. \nThe answer: William H. Maxwell", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Maxwell is a person mentioned in the article, and his job is relevant to the question.\nThe answer: superintendent of New York City schools", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla sought overseas investors before World War I.\nThe answer: overseas", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question contains the negation \"lost\", which is important to consider. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: Tesla sold Wardenclyffe for $20,000.\nThe answer: sold it.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla sold Wardenclyffe for $20,000.\nThe answer: $20,000", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Tesla received the Edison Medal.\nThe answer: Edison Medal", "{1, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if Tesla's idea was incorrect, then the opposite of his idea is correct. Rule 7 is relevant because the question contains a synonym for \"electricity\" (\"reflecting electricity\") that may be important for understanding the answer. Rule 13 is relevant because the name \"Tesla\" is important for identifying the answer.\nThe answer: Electrical Experimenter", "{rule list: 3, 23}\nExplanation: The article describes Tesla's idea of using electricity to locate submarines by reflecting an \"electric ray\" of \"tremendous frequency\" and viewing the signal on a fluorescent screen. This system has a superficial resemblance to modern radar, but Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water. The answer to the question is not explicitly stated in the article, but it can be inferred that the operator would observe the reflected signal on a fluorescent screen. This is because Tesla's proposed system involved using a fluorescent screen to view the signal. Additionally, the article mentions that Tesla's system had a superficial resemblance to modern radar, which also involves observing reflected signals on a screen. \nThe answer: on a fluorescent screen", "{3, 7, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Tesla's idea of using electricity to locate submarines via reflection has a superficial resemblance to modern radar. This indicates that Tesla's idea was similar to the invention of radar.\nThe answer: radar", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a person involved in the development of radar in France, so rule 4 applies to distinguish between profession and nationality. Rule 13 applies to indicate that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: \u00c9mile Girardeau", "{rule list: 1, 7, 13, 16, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for who was claimed to have won the 1915 Nobel prize in Physics according to a Reuters news agency report. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that the Reuters news agency report claimed that both Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla won the prize, but this was later corrected. Rule 7 applies because the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 13 applies because names are equally important for the answer. Rule 16 applies because first comes before last and last comes after first. Rule 18 applies because negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla (but the prize was actually awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg)", "{1, 3, 8, 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer must be the actual winners of the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics, which were Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg, as stated in the Reuters story from Stockholm on 15 November. The passage also mentions that there were rumors that Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize, but the Nobel Foundation denied this and stated that a recipient could only decline a Nobel Prize after being announced a winner. Therefore, rules 1, 3, 8, 12, 13, and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg.", "{7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the rumored reason why Edison and Tesla were not awarded the prize, implying that they were not actually awarded the prize. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. Rule 7 tells us that synonyms from words in the context paragraph may appear in the question. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Combining these rules, we can infer that the rumored reason Edison and Tesla were not awarded the prize was because they refused it. \nThe answer: They refused the prize.", "{16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: In this sentence, the Nobel Foundation is the subject and \"decline a Nobel Prize\" is the verb. Therefore, the sentence is in the active voice. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb. The sentence also contains a negation (\"only decline\"), so Rule 17 applies. Finally, the sentence contains a temporal relationship (\"before he is announced a winner\"), so Rule 16 applies. \nThe answer: A recipient can only decline a Nobel Prize after he is announced a winner.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that there were claims that Edison and Tesla did not receive the award because of their animosity towards each other and that they each sought to minimize the other's achievements. This implies that there may have been a negative relationship between the two, which is a form of negation. Therefore, rules 3 and 17 are relevant. Rule 8 is also relevant because profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is asking for a reason why they did not receive an award, not their professions or nationalities. \nThe answer: Their animosity towards each other.", "{rule list: 10, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Edison received \"one of 38 possible bids\" in 1915.\nThe answer: 38", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this sentence, \"Edison\" is mentioned before \"1915,\" so Edison received the bid in 1915.\nThe answer: Edison", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla received a Nobel Prize bid in 1937, which comes after the year 1915 when Edison received one.\nThe answer: 1937", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1,655,114", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that Tesla received his last patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL aircraft) and then be \"gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices\" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane. \nThe answer: U.S. Patent 1,655,114 was granted for a biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL aircraft) and then be \"gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices\" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: Tesla believed the plane would sell for less than $1,000.\nThe answer: less than $1,000", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the biplane design by Tesla was the earliest proposal for the use of turbine engines in rotor aircraft. This implies that the biplane design had turbine engines.\nThe answer: turbine engines", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"paying his rent\" implies that Tesla's salary was more than just $125 per month. Rule 7 applies because \"salary\" is a synonym for \"pay\" and is in the context paragraph. \nThe answer: $125 per month", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Westinghouse paid Tesla's rent at the Hotel New Yorker and expenses for the rest of his life.\nThe answer: Westinghouse paid for Tesla's rent and expenses for the rest of his life.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Westinghouse paid Tesla's expenses and a monthly fee for the rest of his life, indicating that he received this compensation until he passed away.\nThe answer: for the rest of Tesla's life.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, Westinghouse was worried about potential bad publicity surrounding Tesla's impoverished conditions, so by paying him a monthly fee and covering his expenses, they were potentially trying to avoid negative publicity. Rule 4 applies because profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question does not ask about Tesla's profession. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about what Westinghouse was potentially trying to avoid, which is a negation. \nThe answer: potential bad publicity surrounding Tesla's impoverished conditions", "{1, 3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: According to the passage, Tesla claimed to be able to transmit mechanical energy with minimal loss over any terrestrial distance.\nThe answer: mechanical energy", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the distance over which mechanical energy can be transmitted with minimal loss. Rule 3 states that distance is a different concept from other qualities like size or shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is not specified in the article.", "{rule list: 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the amount of energy loss that Tesla expected, which implies that he may have mentioned a specific amount or degree of loss. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"minimal loss,\" which means that the answer should be the opposite of this. \nThe answer: Not specified (since the question asks for a specific amount and none is given in the article)", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla announced a method of accurately determining the location of underground mineral deposits. \nThe answer: mineral deposits", "{rule list: 10, 11, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Contractions and typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. The question asks for the time when Tesla made certain claims. The relevant information is that Tesla made these claims in 1935, as stated in the article passage.\nThe answer: 1935", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Tesla was \"making his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons\" when he was hit by the taxicab.\nThe answer: feed the pigeons", "{rule list: 10, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question asks who Tesla refused to see, but the passage states that Tesla refused to consult a doctor. Therefore, the answer is: a doctor.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"body parts are different concepts\" (rule 3) applies to this question, as well as the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" (rule 8). The answer is: three of his ribs were broken.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla was bedridden for \"some months\" after the accident and was able to get up \"in early 1938.\" This means that he first got out of bed in early 1938, several months after the accident.\nThe answer: early 1938", "{rule list: 10, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it says \"In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker...\" This sentence gives us the time frame of the accident. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 tells us that we should prioritize the order of events in the passage. \nThe answer: fall of 1937", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage describes a weapon that Tesla claimed to have invented, which was referred to as a \"peace ray\" or \"death ray\" by the press. The weapon was capable of being used against ground-based infantry or for anti-aircraft purposes. This answer requires understanding that \"teleforce\" weapon is a synonym for the weapon Tesla talked about, and that \"peace ray\" and \"death ray\" are two different names for the same weapon.\nThe answer: a \"peace ray\" or death ray", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks about what Tesla was studying when he came up with the idea for the \"teleforce\" weapon. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so the fact that the Van de Graaff generator is a machine and not a concept is irrelevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"teleforce\" can be understood as the same thing as the \"peace ray\" or death ray\" mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: the Van de Graaff generator", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to a \"ground-based infantry,\" which falls under the concept of \"group\" and is not a synonym for any other word in the context. \nThe answer: infantry", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the weapon could be used against ground-based infantry or for anti-aircraft purposes. Rule 3 states that different concepts such as \"use\" and \"purpose\" should not be confused. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is \"anti-aircraft purposes\". \nThe answer: anti-aircraft purposes", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a synonym for \"peace ray.\" Rule 3 states that synonyms are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the answer will be related to peace. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"peace ray\" in the article. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"other than\" in the question. \nThe answer: death ray", "{rule list: 1, 10, 11}\nExplanation: Tesla claimed to have built the weapon in 1937.\nThe answer: 1937.", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the occasion when Tesla claimed he had made the death ray. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"claimed\". Rule 22 tells us that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last, but there are only two entities mentioned in the passage, so this rule is not relevant. \nThe answer: a luncheon in his honor", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the material of the pellets used in Tesla's death ray. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these properties of the pellets is irrelevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"material\" can be replaced with \"what the pellets were made of.\" \nThe answer: tungsten", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the device is based on a narrow stream of small tungsten pellets that are accelerated via high voltage. This indicates that the answer is a method of accelerating the pellets, and that the pellets are made of tungsten.\nThe answer: high voltage", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: Tesla claimed that \"only a little time will pass\" before he could give the death ray to the world.\nThe answer: a little time", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: charged particle beam weapons", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Nikola Tesla Museum archive is located in Belgrade.\nThe answer: Belgrade", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: Tesla's treatise describes a method of charging particles to millions of volts, as stated in the article. This information directly answers the question, and the use of rule 2 helps to clarify that \"millions\" is the most specific and accurate answer to the question. \nThe answer: millions of volts", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for what Tesla claimed the weapon would end, which is a negation. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"end.\" The answer is \"put an end to all war.\" \nThe answer: all war", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Tesla was afraid someone was trying to steal his invention. (Note: \"steal\" is a synonym for \"take\" and \"trying to do with his invention\" is a synonym for \"efforts had been made to steal the invention\". The negation in \"no danger that his invention could be stolen\" is important to note.)", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Tesla claimed that the blueprint for the teleforce weapon was all in his mind and he had not committed any part of it to paper, indicating that he did not store the blueprint on paper or any other physical medium.\nThe answer: in his mind", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla's papers had been scrutinized by the thieves or spies who entered his room. \nThe answer: His papers", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts such as size, shape, and color. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Applying these rules, we can determine that Tesla was 86 years old when he died.\nThe answer: 86", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage states that Tesla died on \"7 January 1943,\" so the date is the answer.\nThe answer: 7 January 1943", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla's body was found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered his room. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (Tesla's body) is acted upon the verb (was found). Therefore, the answer is Alice Monaghan.\nThe answer: Alice Monaghan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a \"do not disturb\" sign", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the cause of death was coronary thrombosis. This information is directly stated in the passage and is a clear answer to the question.\nThe answer: coronary thrombosis.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The rules selected cover concepts such as possession, safety, and analysis of Tesla's belongings, as well as the fact that Tesla was an American citizen. The irrelevant information about John G. Trump's background and the three-day investigation is ignored. \nThe answer: They were seized by the Alien Property Custodian and transported to the Manhattan Storage and Warehouse Company for analysis. John G. Trump concluded that there was nothing hazardous about them.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it is stated that \"John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items in OAP custody.\"\nThe answer: John G. Trump", "{rule list: 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for what could constitute a hazard, implying that the answer is something that was not found. Therefore, we can apply rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is: nothing.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla's belongings were transported to the Manhattan Storage and Warehouse Company. This is a location and therefore falls under rule 13. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and is not relevant to this question.\nThe answer: Manhattan Storage and Warehouse Company", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the person who wrote and read Tesla's eulogy. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the names mentioned in the passage. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we can use this rule to determine the gender of the person who gave the eulogy. \nThe answer: Louis Adamic", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the eulogy was written by Slovene-American author Louis Adamic. The first sentence also mentions that the eulogy was read by New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia, but the question specifically asks for the author. Therefore, rule 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) are relevant.\nThe answer: Louis Adamic", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla's funeral took place on January 12.\nThe answer: January 12", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla.\" This indicates that the number of people who attended the funeral was 2000.\nThe answer: 2000", "{rule list: 13, 14}\nExplanation: Names and locations are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: The funeral was held at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York City.", "{1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that Tesla's estate was shipped to Belgrade, implying that it was previously located elsewhere. Rule 2 applies because the trunks were marked with N.T., which is a clear reference to Nikola Tesla. Rule 13 applies because the question specifically asks for the location of Tesla's property. \nThe answer: Belgrade", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a person's relationship to Nikola Tesla. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names. Therefore, the answer requires identifying the male relative of Tesla mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: Sava Kosanovi\u0107", "{rule list: 13, 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Sava Kosanovi\u0107's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade. \nThe answer: Charlotte Muzar.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla's ashes were transported from the United States to Belgrade by his nephew's secretary, Charlotte Muzar. Therefore, the answer is: Belgrade. \nThe answer: Belgrade.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla's ashes are currently displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. Therefore, we need to identify the current location of Tesla's ashes. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the mention of Tesla's ashes in the article. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we need to look for information about the current location of Tesla's ashes after they were transported to Belgrade. \nThe answer: In the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide, but some are unaccounted for. It also mentions that at least 278 patents have been accounted for in 26 countries. Therefore, the answer is not an exact number, but rather an approximation: around 300. \nThe answer: around 300", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla had patents in \"26 countries that have been accounted for.\" This means that he held patents in at least 26 countries.\nThe answer: 26", "{3, 4, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the country where Tesla had patents granted, which is a matter of identifying the relevant information in the passage. Rules 3 and 7 are relevant because they remind us to focus on the concept of countries and to pay attention to synonyms in the question. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that nationality and profession are different concepts, and we need to focus on the concept of countries. Rule 12 is relevant because it reminds us to ignore irrelevant information in the passage. \nThe answer: Canada", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and negations are important for the answer (rule 17). The question asks where missing patents were later found, implying that they were previously missing. Therefore, the answer is nowhere, as the question states that \"various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives.\" \nThe answer: nowhere", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla had dinner at exactly 8:10 p.m.\nThe answer: 8:10 p.m.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the working hours before dinner, implying that there were working hours after dinner as well. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the order of events. \nThe answer: Tesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, and often resumed his work until 3:00 a.m. on some nights. This means that on some nights, Tesla worked until 3:00 a.m.\nThe answer: 3:00 a.m.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The first relevant rule is rule 16, which states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage mentions Delmonico's restaurant first and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel second, so it can be inferred that Tesla dined at Delmonico's before switching to the Waldorf-Astoria. The second relevant rule is rule 22, which states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last.\" In this case, the passage lists Delmonico's first and the Waldorf-Astoria second, so it can be inferred that Delmonico's is the former and the Waldorf-Astoria is the latter. Therefore, the answer is the headwaiter at Delmonico's restaurant (and possibly also at the Waldorf-Astoria).", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is relevant because it clarifies that the distance walked is a separate concept from the act of squishing his toes. \nThe answer: 8 to 10 miles per day", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because walking is a form of exercise, and exercising more is equivalent to walking more. Rule 3 applies because the reason for walking is related to health and fitness, not size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: For exercise.", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: Tesla squished his toes one hundred times for each foot every night.\nThe answer: squished his toes", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. In this case, \"brain cells\" is a different concept from \"toes\", so we can infer that Tesla was hoping to stimulate his brain cells with the toe squishing.\nThe answer: his brain cells", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Tesla's statement \"I did not believe in telepathy\" is a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: telepathy", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Brisbane's job is mentioned in the article as \"newspaper editor\".\nThe answer: Newspaper editor", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: one", "{3, 5, 12, 20}\nExplanation: The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts eliminates any confusion about what type of animals Tesla cared for. Rule 3 clarifies that \"animals\" and \"pigeons\" are different concepts. Rule 12 allows us to ignore the irrelevant information about Tesla's daily routine and focus on the relevant information about the animals he cared for. Rule 20 clarifies that \"he\" refers to Tesla. \nThe answer: pigeons", "{rule list: 3, 10, 13}\nExplanation: The answer is a specific amount of money that Tesla spent on an injured pigeon. This information is directly stated in the passage and is not affected by any of the other rules. The rules that apply are rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), rule 10 (typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer), and rule 13 (names are equally important for the answer). \nThe answer: over $2,000", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Tesla spent money to fix the pigeon's broken wing and leg, so it was injured. The question asks for what was wrong with the pigeon, which is a synonym for injured.\nThe answer: broken wing and leg", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons\nThe answer: the park", "{rule list: 13, 21}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla brought injured pigeons into his hotel room to nurse back to health, indicating that he took care of them in his hotel room.\nThe answer: his hotel room", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage directly states that Tesla weighed 142 pounds.\nThe answer: 142 pounds", "{rule 3, rule 8}\nExplanation: The article directly states that Tesla was 6 feet 2 inches tall, which is a measurement of his size. Rule 3 applies because height is a concept related to size, not shape or color. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a measurement of a physical attribute, not a profession or nationality.\nThe answer: 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m)", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 and 16. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the passage tells us that Tesla had almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926, which means that his weight was consistent during that time frame. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the time frame in question is from 1888 to 1926. \nThe answer: from 1888 to about 1926", "Rule 3, Rule 12, Rule 17, Rule 20\nExplanation: The question asks about where Tesla lived while he was looking good, which is not directly mentioned in the article. However, it is implied that he was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, which is a location mentioned in the article. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so \"he\" in the question refers to Tesla. \nThe answer: New York City", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that languages are different concepts. We use rule 16 to determine that first comes before last. The passage states that Tesla spoke eight languages, listing them in a specific order. Therefore, the answer is: 8.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify what Tesla saw during his strange illnesses, which is a negation. Rule 3 tells us that color is a different concept, so we can eliminate that. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use it to infer that if Tesla had blinding flashes of light, then he did not see anything during his illnesses. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: Tesla had blinding flashes of light, but did not see anything during his strange illnesses.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Tesla's ability to visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision is also known as picture thinking.\nThe answer: picture thinking", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying what other visual phenomena accompanied Tesla's visions. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so it is relevant to understanding that the answer is about an antonym of \"blinding flashes of light.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so it is relevant to understanding that the answer is about a visual phenomenon that was not a blinding flash of light. \nThe answer: visions", "{1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they establish that if Tesla had a photographic memory, then he would be able to memorize complete books and speak eight languages fluently. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that memory is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 10 is relevant because it establishes that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 is relevant because it establishes that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: photographic memory", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"spending more than 48 hours in a stretch\" means that Tesla spent more time than someone else, indicating that he spent a longer time than usual. Rule 3 applies because gambling is a different concept from billiards, chess, and card-playing. \nThe answer: more than 48 hours", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest.\nThe answer: 84 hours", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Tesla was studying at Graz when he started playing cards and billiards.\nThe answer: Graz", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Kenneth Swezey is the last person mentioned in the passage and therefore the answer to the question. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, which confirms that Tesla is the one who called Swezey.\nThe answer: Kenneth Swezey", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is relevant because the question asks for Swezey's job, which is a profession. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is also relevant because the question specifically asks for Swezey's name.\nThe answer: journalist", "{rule list: 19, 20}\nExplanation: The rules state that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession and that \"he\" refers to male names. Therefore, the answer is \"his chastity\". \nThe answer: chastity", "{rule list: 13, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question asks for the identity of the people who reportedly wanted Tesla's company. The relevant rules are 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and 20-21 (pronouns \"he,\" \"she,\" \"his,\" and \"her\" refer to male and female names). The answer is not given in the article, so it cannot be determined.", "{1, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if Tesla made a sacrifice by not marrying, then he believes that having a relationship would have been more beneficial to his work. Rule 10 is relevant because the contraction \"he'd\" is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because the negation \"not\" is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Toward the end of his life.", "{rule 13, 20}\nExplanation: The passage mentions Tesla's loyal secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, who wrote about his character. \"His\" refers to Tesla, indicating that he is male. \nThe answer: Dorothy Skerrit", "{13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who described Tesla as having a \"distinguished sweetness.\" This involves recognizing that the quote is a description of Tesla's personality and demeanor, and that the person who said it is named Robert Underwood Johnson. The relevant rules are 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and 17 (negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: Robert Underwood Johnson", "{rule list: 1, 2, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Tesla was prone to seclude himself with his work. \nThe answer: seclude himself", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to this question requires identifying the word used to describe Tesla's sociability. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the passage states that Tesla was \"asocial,\" which means he was not very sociable. Rule 2 is also relevant because it establishes that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, \"asocial\" is the extreme form of not being sociable, so it can be considered the least sociable. Finally, rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. The answer: asocial.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Julian Hawthorne was a friend of Tesla.\nThe answer: friend", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain in middle age and they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.\nThe answer: Mark Twain", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.\nThe answer: in his lab and elsewhere", "{rule list: 13, 16, 18}\nExplanation: Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck in the late 1920s.\nThe answer: late 1920s", "5, 8, 17, 19, 20, 21\nExplanation: Rule 5 separates the concepts of people and animals. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Rules 20 and 21 state that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, and \"his\" refer to male names and \"her\" refer to female names. \nThe answer: overweight people", "1, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"firing\" is a profession-related action. Rule 8 applies because \"harsh\" is the antonym of \"kind\" and the question asks for the person who was fired, which is the opposite of the person who fired. Rule 17 applies because the question is in the negative form. \nThe answer: a secretary because of her weight", "1, 8, 17, 20, 21\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that Tesla expressed disgust for overweight people. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the reason for the firing, implying that the firing was a negative action. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"why did he fire\"), indicating that the answer should be the opposite of what is being negated. Rules 20 and 21 apply because the question uses the pronoun \"he\" to refer to Tesla. \nThe answer: Because of her weight.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress. This implies that he did not like her outfit and made her change it.\nThe answer: He made her go home and change her dress.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Tesla believed that there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge, and if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could only exist in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity. Therefore, he denied the existence of electrons.\nThe answer: electrons", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: According to rule 3, color is a different concept from other concepts mentioned in the passage. Rule 8 states that if A disagrees with B on X, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: \"an all pervasive 'ether'\".", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it distinguishes the concept of the ether from physical properties like size and shape. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is also relevant because the question asks about what Tesla believed the ether did, implying that he believed it had a function or purpose. \nThe answer: transmitted electrical energy", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive \"ether\" that transmitted electrical energy. This answer requires the application of rule 3 to differentiate between the concepts of time period and scientific concept, and rule 17 to identify the importance of negations in the question.\nThe answer: 19th century", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person whose theory Tesla disagreed with, so we can use rule 3 to determine that \"matter into energy\" and \"theory of relativity\" are different concepts. Then, we can use rule 17 to note that the word \"antagonistic\" implies disagreement. \nThe answer: Einstein's theory of relativity", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking about Tesla's attitude towards the conversion of matter into energy. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that Tesla was \"antagonistic\" towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy. \nThe answer: Tesla was generally opposed to the idea.", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Tesla spoke critically toward \"Einstein's theory of relativity.\"\nThe answer: theory of relativity", "{rule list: 1, 2, 7, 10, 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the specific theory that Tesla claimed to have completed in 1937. Rule 1 and 2 are not relevant as there are no comparisons in the question. Rule 7 is relevant as the question contains a synonym for \"theory\". Rule 10 is relevant as typos in the question are irrelevant. Rule 12 is relevant as irrelevant passages in the context are not important. Rule 13 is relevant as names are important for the answer. Rule 17 is relevant as negations in the question are important. \nThe answer: dynamic theory of gravity", "{rule list: 1, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about when Tesla started working on the problem, which implies that he worked on it for some time. Rule 7 applies because \"problem\" is a synonym for \"physical principle.\" \nThe answer: 1892", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other concepts, so it is important to note that Tesla considered the concept of curved space to be false, not a specific shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Tesla considered curved space to be a false conception, then he considered flat space to be the correct conception. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so it is important to note that Tesla considered curved space to be a false conception. \nThe answer: Curved space", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage states that Tesla claimed to have completed his dynamic theory of gravity in a letter he wrote in 1937, at age 81. Therefore, the answer is 81.\nThe answer: 81", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between two things, which is necessary to understand that if Tesla was a proponent of an idea, then he was a fan of it. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that different concepts, such as eugenics and race, are not interchangeable. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Tesla was a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is not applicable to the question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant to the question. \nThe answer: Tesla believed that humans' \"pity\" had interfered with the natural \"ruthless workings of nature.\"", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that Tesla believed that humans' \"pity\" had interfered with the natural \"ruthless workings of nature.\" This means that the attribute of humans that interfered with nature's ruthlessness, according to Tesla, was their pity. \nThe answer: pity", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time when Tesla talked about his beliefs in an interview, which requires identifying a specific event in the past. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. Rule 23 reminds us that active and passive sentences have different structures, which can affect how we identify the subject and verb in a sentence. \nThe answer: There is no answer to this question in the given article.", "{1, 4, 19}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"dominant\" implies superiority, and therefore, the opposite of \"dominant\" is \"subservient.\" Rule 4 applies because \"gender\" and \"profession\" are different concepts. Rule 19 applies because gender is irrelevant to one's ability to run the world. \nThe answer: Women/Queen Bees.", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: This question asks for a specific time when Tesla talked about his thoughts on gender. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the year 1926 comes before any other year mentioned in the article. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, which means that \"he\" in the question refers to Tesla. \nThe answer: In 1926.", "{4, 20}\nExplanation: The answer is \"Queen Bees\". Rule 4 states that profession and gender are different concepts, so the fact that Tesla believed women would become dominant does not imply a specific profession or title. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so \"Queen Bees\" refers to female rulers.", "{3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses Tesla's predictions about the issues of a post-World War I environment. \nThe answer: post-World War I era", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The title of the article is \"Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War.\" The answer is \"Science and Discovery.\" \nThe use of rule 3 is to differentiate between the concepts of \"Science and Discovery\" and \"the Consummation of the War.\" The use of rule 7 is to identify that \"great Forces\" is a synonym for \"Science and Discovery.\"", "{rule list: 10, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the publication date of an article mentioned in the context. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the \"[citation needed]\" part. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the date mentioned in the context (\"20 December 1914\") refers to the publication date of the article. \nThe answer: 20 December 1914.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: \"not a remedy\" is a negation, which is important for the answer. \"Entity\" refers to an organization or group. \nThe answer: League of Nations", "{rule list: 19, 23}\nExplanation: Tesla's upbringing in a particular religion is relevant to the question, and the passive voice in the sentence \"Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian\" indicates that the subject (Tesla) was acted upon by the verb (raised). \nThe answer: Orthodox Christian", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla \"opposed religious fanaticism,\" which refers to extreme or excessive religious behavior.\nThe answer: religious fanaticism", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that religion and nationality are different concepts, so Tesla's respect for Buddhism and Christianity should not be confused with his Orthodox Christian upbringing. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"express respect for\" can be understood as \"had a profound respect for.\" \nThe answer: Buddhism and Christianity.", "{rule list: 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"in his article, 'A Machine to End War', published in 1937\". Rule 7 applies because \"article\" is a synonym for \"piece of writing\". Rule 12 applies because the rest of the paragraph is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 applies because the name \"Tesla\" is not important for the answer.\nThe answer: A Machine to End War", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and cannot be compared. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. In the given passage, it is stated that Tesla's religious views remain uncertain due to \"other statements that he made.\" Therefore, the answer is that it is uncertain or unknown what his religious views were.", "{3, 7, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the thing that the machine in Tesla's article \"A Machine to End War\" hoped to end. The answer can be found in the title of the article itself. Rules 3 and 7 remind us that we should focus on the specific concept being asked about and that synonyms may be used in the question. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 reminds us that some passages in the context may be irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important for the answer. \nThe answer: war", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: Tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals. Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla, and The Tesla Papers. \nThe answer: My Inventions, The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla, and The Tesla Papers.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who published Tesla's writings, which falls under the concept of profession. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any mention of Tesla's nationality is irrelevant. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the names of the publishers. \nThe answer: Ben Johnston, David Hatcher Childress, and unknown publishers for The Tesla Papers.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who edited Tesla's autobiography.\nThe relevant rules are 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first).\nThe answer: Ben Johnston.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of Tesla's writings, which is explicitly stated in the article as being freely available on the web. Negation is important to note here, as the answer would be different if the question asked where the writings could not be found.\nThe answer: on the web", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the publication date of an article, which is a specific piece of information that can be found in the text. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the article \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\" was published before the book \"Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.\" Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" which means that we need to look for an active sentence that mentions the publication date of the article. The sentence \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\" was published in The Century Magazine in 1900\" is an active sentence that provides the answer to the question.\nThe answer: 1900", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"titles of books are different concepts from articles\" (rule 3) applies here. The question asks for a book where articles can be read, so we need to identify a book that contains articles. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" (rule 7) also applies, as the question uses the word \"book\" but the article uses the phrase \"his book.\" Finally, the rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" (rule 13) applies, as we need to identify the specific book mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Tesla's work is featured in science fiction.\nThe answer: science fiction.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12}\nExplanation: References to Tesla can be found in various types of media, including books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics, and video games, as stated in the article. This answer is obtained by applying rules 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 to identify the different concepts involved and eliminate irrelevant information.", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the impact of Tesla's technologies is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction, indicating that there are multiple types. The question asks for a number, so we can ignore irrelevant information. \nThe answer: multiple/several (any indication of more than one)", "{rule list: names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the magazine on which Tesla appeared in 1931. The relevant rule is that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Time magazine", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that Tesla was put on the cover of Time magazine on his 75th birthday in 1931. This is a passive sentence, where Tesla is the subject being acted upon by the verb \"was put.\" Therefore, we apply rules 16 and 23 to determine that the occasion was Tesla's 75th birthday.\nThe answer: Tesla's 75th birthday", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions Tesla's contribution to electrical power generation, which falls under the concept of technology.\nThe answer: electrical power generation", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a famous person who congratulated Tesla. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Albert Einstein.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tesla received congratulatory letters from \"more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein.\" This means that at least 71 important people sent letters.\nThe answer: at least 71", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the branch of theoretical computer science that deals with classifying computational problems by difficulty and relationship. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about computational problems. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can use \"classifying\" as a synonym for \"broadly categorizing.\" Therefore, the answer is computational complexity theory. \nThe answer: Computational complexity theory", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 and 7, which state that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The answer is \"inherent difficulty.\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: computational problem", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the inherent difficulty of a computational problem is defined by the amount of resources needed to solve it, such as time and storage. This is a measure of the problem's complexity, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color (rule 3) and from animals and vehicles (rule 5). \nThe answer: amount of resources needed to solve the problem", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: mathematical models of computation are used to study and quantify the amount of resources needed to solve a problem, such as time and storage.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage.\" These are the two primary resources used to gauge complexity.\nThe answer: time and storage", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. These rules eliminate irrelevant information about other complexity measures mentioned in the article. The only relevant information is that the number of gates in a circuit is used to measure circuit complexity.\nThe answer: number of gates", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, animals and vehicles are different concepts, and negations are important for the answer. The question asks about the practical role of defining the complexity of problems in everyday computing. The answer is that it helps determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory, but it also distinguishes between these fields and computational complexity theory. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are the most relevant. \nThe answer: analysis of algorithms and computability theory", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two things (analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory) and their respective levels of focus. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts within theoretical computer science. \nThe answer: Analysis of algorithms", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Analysis of algorithms is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas computational complexity theory asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. The question uses the phrase \"all possible algorithms\" which is a synonym for \"general question about all possible algorithms.\" Negations are important for the answer because the question asks for the field that analyzes all possible algorithms, not just a particular algorithm. \nThe answer: computational complexity theory", "{3, 4, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a field of computer science that deals with the solvability of problems using algorithms. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as \"likelihood\" are not the same as concepts like \"resources needed\" or \"restrictions.\" Rule 4 tells us that we should not confuse fields of study with nationalities or professions. Rule 9 tells us that if a problem can be solved with more resources, it is more likely to be solvable than a problem that requires fewer resources. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question.\nThe answer: computational complexity theory", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the input string of a computational problem should not be confused with the problem itself. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which means that we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. Therefore, the answer is \"problem instance\". \nThe answer: problem instance", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. Negation is important for the answer because the question asks for the term given to describe the baseline abstract question, so we need to exclude any descriptions of instances or solutions. \nThe answer: problem", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts,\" which is not relevant to this question. Rule 17 states that \"negations are important for the answer,\" which is relevant because the question asks for the typical characterization of a problem instance, and the answer is whether it is abstract or concrete. The use of the word \"rather\" in the passage suggests that the two terms are contrasting, and the passage goes on to explain that an instance is a \"rather concrete utterance,\" implying that the problem itself is more abstract. Therefore, the answer is concrete. \n\nThe answer: concrete", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that a problem instance is the input string for a computational problem, and is a particular input to the problem. Therefore, another name for any given measure of input associated with a problem is problem instance.\nThe answer: problem instance", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a general term used to describe the output to any given input in a problem instance. This is a concept in computational complexity theory, which is covered by rule 3. However, the question specifically mentions \"problem instance,\" which is a term that should not be confused with the problem itself, according to rule 3. Therefore, we also need to consider rule 4, which distinguishes between different concepts such as profession and nationality. The answer is \"solution.\" \n\nThe answer: solution", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of kilometers that the traveling salesman problem seeks to classify a route between the 15 largest cities in Germany. The passage states that the decision version of the problem asks if there is a route of at most 2000 kilometers passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities. Therefore, the answer is 2000 kilometers.\nThe answer: 2000 kilometers", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the quantitative answer to a specific instance of the traveling salesman problem (a route through Germany's 15 largest cities) is not useful for solving other instances (such as a round trip through Milan). This is an example of how the shape or specific details of a problem instance can affect the solution, even if the problem itself is the same. \nThe answer: a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km.", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific instance of the traveling salesman problem mentioned in the article is not relevant to the answer. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages in the context are not important for the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the wording of the question. \nThe answer: Computational problems, not particular problem instances.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that in computational problems, a problem instance can be described as a string over an alphabet. The passage also specifies that the alphabet is usually taken to be the binary alphabet, and that other mathematical objects must be suitably encoded as bitstrings. Therefore, we can conclude that a problem instance can be described as a bitstring. \nThe answer: problem instance", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1})\", indicating that the binary alphabet is the most commonly used alphabet in a problem instance.\nThe answer: binary alphabet", "{rules 1, 7, 10, 11}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a synonym for \"string of a problem instance.\" Rules 1, 7, 10, and 11 are relevant because they deal with synonyms, typos, and contractions. The answer: problem instance string.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Integers are commonly represented in binary notation. \nThe answer: binary notation", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that shape and mathematical objects are different concepts, and rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the answer is \"by encoding their adjacency matrices or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.\"", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between two entities based on a comparative attribute, which is relevant in this case as the article discusses decision problems in comparison to other types of computational problems. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to the question. \nThe answer: Decision problems", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: A decision problem has a yes or no answer, which are simple word responses. Size, shape, and color are different concepts and do not apply to this question. \nThe answer: yes or no", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"yes\" and \"no\" are opposite responses. Rule 2 applies because \"1\" and \"0\" are opposite responses. Rule 3 applies because \"yes\" and \"no\" are not numerical concepts. Rule 8 applies because if one response is more common than the other, then the less common response is its antonym. \nThe answer: yes and no (or 1 and 0)", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the output for a member of the language, which is equivalent to asking if the answer is \"yes\". Rule 3 applies because the article defines a decision problem as a formal language where the members are instances whose output is \"yes\". Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the affirmative answer. \nThe answer: yes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: A decision problem is a computational problem whose answer is either yes or no. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes, the algorithm is said to accept the input string.\nThe answer: yes", "{3}\nExplanation: The rule states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the type of graph is a different concept from these other characteristics. \nThe answer: arbitrary graph", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the term associated with the set of all connected graphs in relation to the decision problem described in the article. The relevant rules are 3 and 7, which state that concepts such as size, shape, and age are different and that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The answer is \"formal language.\"", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The question asks about the encoding decision that needs to be made, which is related to how the concept of a graph is represented as a binary string. Therefore, the answer is that the decision that needs to be made is how graphs are encoded as binary strings.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: A function problem is a type of computational problem, which falls under the concept of \"profession\" in rule 4. It is not related to size, shape, age, color, animals, or vehicles, as per rule 3. \nThe answer: computational problem", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: A function problem expects a single output for every input. Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are therefore irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: One", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the type of problem that the traveling salesman problem belongs to. The passage states that the traveling salesman problem is a notable example of a function problem, which is a computational problem where a single output is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply. \nThe answer: function problem", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage lists two examples of function problems: the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem. Therefore, the answer is the integer factorization problem. \nThe answer: the integer factorization problem", "{2}\nExplanation: The passage states that the output of a functional problem is \"more complex than that of a decision problem.\" Therefore, the answer is complex. \nThe answer: complex", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Function problems can be recast as decision problems.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the set that represents the multiplication of two integers. The answer is \"the set of triples (a, b, c) such that the relation a \u00d7 b = c holds.\" This is stated in the passage as an example of how a function problem (multiplication) can be recast as a decision problem. The set is not given a specific name in the passage.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The article explains that the time required to solve a computational problem is calculated as a function of the size of the instance, usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. This means that the size of the input is a different concept from the difficulty of solving the problem. Therefore, rule 3 applies. Additionally, the article mentions that the time required to solve a problem (or any measure of complexity) is a commonly used measurement to determine the complexity of a computational problem. Therefore, rule 5 applies.\nThe answer: time required to solve the problem (or any measure of complexity)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The running time of an algorithm may depend on the size of the instance, which is usually measured as the size of the input in bits. This is a specific example of rule 3. Additionally, the running time may depend on the instance itself, as stated in the passage. This is a specific example of rule 8. \nThe answer: size of the instance (usually measured as the size of the input in bits)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from time, but if the size of the input increases, the time required to solve the problem will also increase. Therefore, the time required to solve a problem is calculated as a function of the size of the input in bits, which is a measure of the size of the instance. \nThe answer: It is calculated as a function of the size of the input in bits.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and the passage explicitly mentions that the size of the input is measured in bits, which is a unit of size. \nThe answer: bits", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the time required to solve a computational problem depends on the size of the input in bits, which is a different concept than the shape, age, or color of the input. The passage also mentions that the running time may depend on the instance, which means that if one instance takes more time to solve than another instance, then the latter instance is not necessarily smaller or less complex than the former. Finally, the passage emphasizes that complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size, which implies that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: the size of the input in bits", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who proposed the idea that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm. This is a factual question that requires knowledge of a specific person and their idea. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 are relevant as they state that concepts such as profession and names are important for the answer. The answer is Cobham. \nThe answer: Cobham", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the time taken can be expressed as a function of n,\" which implies that the time complexity is a function of the input size. Additionally, the passage mentions that \"If T(n) is a polynomial in n,\" which further supports the idea that the function of n is a polynomial. \nThe answer: a polynomial function", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 establishes that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the question asks for the term that corresponds to the maximum measurement of time, which is equivalent to asking for the term that corresponds to the most time taken. Therefore, we can apply rule 1 to determine that the answer is the \"worst-case time complexity.\" Rule 3 establishes that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not directly relevant to this question, but helps to clarify that \"size\" and \"time\" are not interchangeable concepts. \nThe answer: worst-case time complexity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it clarifies that the concept of time complexity is distinct from physical size or shape. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because it explains that if the worst-case time complexity of one algorithm is greater than another, then the other algorithm has a lower worst-case time complexity. \nThe answer: T(n)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 and 8, which state that size and mathematical concepts are different, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is \"polynomial time algorithm\".", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes a mathematical model of a general computing machine, which is called a Turing machine. This is a specific term for the concept described in the passage.\nThe answer: Turing machine", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an algorithm", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is asking for the most commonly used model in complexity theory, which is mentioned in the last sentence of the passage. Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not relevant to this question. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes the order of information in the passage, allowing us to identify the relevant sentence. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us to pay attention to negations, which could change the answer. \nThe answer: Turing machine", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those options as possible answers. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if a Turing machine manipulates symbols on a strip of tape, it does not handle them. Therefore, the answer is: symbols.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 establishes that if A is more basic than B, then B is less basic than A. Rule 3 establishes that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and not relevant to the answer. Therefore, the answer is: deterministic Turing machine.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: A deterministic Turing machine uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions, which is a characteristic of rule 1. The fixed set of rules is not influenced by size, shape, age, or color, which are different concepts and fall under rule 3.\nThe answer: A fixed set of rules", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between deterministic and probabilistic Turing machines. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts, including deterministic and probabilistic Turing machines. \nThe answer: probabilistic Turing machine", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The passage describes a non-deterministic Turing machine, which is capable of multiple possible future actions from a given state, and branches into many possible computational paths at each step. This extends into a variety of computational paths, which is not related to size, shape, age, or color. Rule 9 also applies, as it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, a non-deterministic Turing machine is more complex than a deterministic Turing machine, and a deterministic Turing machine is less complex than a non-deterministic Turing machine. Finally, rule 23 applies, which states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The passage describes a non-deterministic Turing machine as an abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes, which is an active sentence. Therefore, the answer is", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" are not relevant to this question. The answer can be found in the passage that \"Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms.\" \nThe answer: randomized algorithms", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The concept of Turing machines is being discussed in the article. The answer is not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The two factors that directly affect how powerful a Turing machine may or may not be are the resources (such as time or space) that are bounded. This is a combination of rules 3 and 8, which state that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage lists several types of Turing machines used to define complexity classes. \nThe answer: deterministic Turing machines and probabilistic Turing machines", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage discusses machine models that are different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is also not relevant to the answer. The answer is: random access machines.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that different machine models have been proposed, but they can be converted to each other without providing any extra computational power. Therefore, the measurement left unaffected by conversion between machine models is the computational power. \nThe answer: computational power", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary,\" indicating that these are the two resources commonly consumed by alternate models that are known to vary.\nThe answer: time and memory consumption", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts is also not relevant. The passage is discussing machine models, so the rule about size, shape, age, and color is also not relevant. The relevant rules are that different machine models share a commonality with Turing machines and that this commonality is not related to extra computational power. The answer is that all these machine models operate deterministically. \n\nThe answer: They all operate deterministically.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: The passage discusses a computational model called a non-deterministic Turing machine, which is able to branch out and check multiple possibilities at once. This type of Turing machine is not necessarily related to physical computing, but is useful for analyzing mathematical models. \nThe answer: non-deterministic Turing machine", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about ease of analysis, which can be seen as a comparison of difficulty between different computational problems. Rule 3 applies because the article mentions that different computational models may be used to analyze problems, and some models may be more suitable for certain types of problems. \nThe answer: the choice of computational resources or models", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: This question is asking about what aspect of useful analysis a non-deterministic Turing machine can capture. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is also not relevant. Therefore, no other rules apply. \nThe answer: The branching of mathematical models.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the most critical resource in the analysis of computational problems associated with non-deterministic Turing machines. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is relevant because the question asks for the opposite of the most critical resource. Therefore, the answer is deterministic time.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the time required by a deterministic Turing machine on input x is the total number of state transitions or steps the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (\"yes\" or \"no\"). This is a definition of the time required to output an answer on a deterministic Turing machine. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that \"time\" is a different concept from \"space\" and should not be confused. Rule 23 is relevant because it explains the concept of a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine. \nThe answer: the total number of state transitions or steps the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (\"yes\" or \"no\")", "{3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how complexity theory classifies problems based on their difficulty, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, or color. The question contains a synonym for \"difficulty\" in \"primary attribute.\" The passage is relevant to the question, and there are no irrelevant details. \nThe answer: difficulty", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the expression used to identify problems that can be solved within a certain amount of time on a deterministic Turing machine. Rule 3 reminds us that size and time are different concepts, so we can't assume that a problem that takes longer to solve is necessarily larger. Rule 9 tells us that if a problem can be solved in less time than another problem, then the first problem is easier. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to pay attention to the wording of the question. The answer is DTIME(f(n)). \nThe answer: DTIME(f(n))", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The most critical resource measured in assessing a Turing machine's ability to solve any given set of problems is time. This is because the time required by a deterministic Turing machine on input x is the total number of state transitions or steps the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer. Additionally, size, shape, and color are not relevant concepts in this context. \nThe answer: time", "{3}\nExplanation: Time and space are both examples of complexity resources.\nThe answer: complexity resources", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Size and space are different concepts, and the question asks for another type of resource that can be viewed as a computational resource. Therefore, the answer is \"size\". \nThe answer: size", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms.\" This indicates that the Blum complexity axioms are typically used to broadly define complexity measures.\nThe answer: Blum complexity axioms", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Communication complexity is a complexity measure used in complexity theory. Therefore, it is a type of complexity measure. Since it is specifically related to communication, it falls under the category of communication complexity. \nThe answer: communication complexity", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that \"other complexity measures used in complexity theory include decision tree complexity,\" indicating that decision tree is a type of complexity measure.\nThe answer: complexity measure", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the three primary expressions used to represent case complexity. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size are different from concepts such as shape or color, so we know that \"best\", \"worst\", and \"average\" are not synonyms for each other. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, but since the question specifically asks for \"expressions\", we can assume that the synonyms for \"best\", \"worst\", and \"average\" are not relevant to the answer. Therefore, the answer is: best, worst, and average.", "{7, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a general measure that is described by \"case complexity likelihoods.\" The word \"likelihoods\" suggests that the answer is a probability measure. Rules 7 and 8 state that questions may contain synonyms and negations are important for the answer. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is a measure of probability, and the word \"case complexity\" implies that it is a measure of the likelihood of different cases or scenarios. \nThe answer: probability of different cases/scenarios", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses different ways of measuring complexity, but does not provide a specific example of a critical complexity measure. Therefore, the answer is not found in the article.", "{3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph), and 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer). The answer is \"inputs of the same size\".", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: quicksort algorithm", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes the time complexity of the quicksort algorithm for sorting a list of integers. The worst-case scenario is when the input is already sorted or sorted in reverse order, which results in a time complexity of O(n2). This represents an extensive time requirement for sorting integers. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply. \nThe answer: worst-case complexity", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the time complexity of the quicksort algorithm in different scenarios. The worst-case scenario is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2). The expression \"worst-case\" denotes the scenario with the highest time complexity.\nThe answer: O(n2)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the minimum time required by the most efficient algorithm to solve a given problem, which is contingent on determining the upper and lower bounds of the algorithm's time complexity. This is covered by rules 3 and 8, which state that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: the most efficient algorithm", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms, which is a specific field within computational science. This question does not involve any concepts related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles, so rules 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, and 16 are not relevant. \nThe answer: analysis of algorithms", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a comparison between upper and lower bounds. Rule 2 states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, upper bounds are easier to establish than lower bounds, so the answer is \"lower bounds\". Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. This rule is relevant because it helps to clarify that the answer is \"lower bounds\" and not \"upper bounds\". The antonym of \"difficult\" is \"easy\", so if lower bounds are more difficult to establish, then upper bounds are easier to establish.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a specific algorithm with a certain time complexity, which is a comparison between two algorithms. Rule 3 applies because time complexity is a different concept from other measures of complexity such as space consumption. \nThe answer: worst-case time complexity", "{7, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a colloquial phrase, which implies that the answer may not be explicitly stated in the article. Rule 7 allows for the use of synonyms, so we can look for a phrase that conveys the idea of \"all possible algorithms.\" Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can ignore the minor typo in \"irrespective.\" Rule 12 allows us to ignore irrelevant passages in the article. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to look for a phrase that conveys the idea of \"unlimited availability irrespective of time\" in a negative way. \nThe answer: \"no algorithm that might be discovered in the future\"", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because upper and lower bounds are opposite concepts. Rule 3 applies because size is a different concept from the notation used to convey upper or lower bounds. \nThe answer: big O notation", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because big O notation hides constant factors and smaller terms, which means that if A has a larger constant factor or smaller terms than B, they will not be reflected in the big O notation. Rule 3 applies because size and constant factors are different concepts. \nThe answer: constant factors and smaller terms", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 1 because the article compares T(n) to n2, and rule 3 because size is a concept that is being compared. The answer is: T(n) = O(n2).", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the use of big O notation allows for the comparison of upper and lower bounds regardless of the specific values of the constants and smaller terms in the function. Rule 3 applies because the concept of upper and lower bounds is separate from the specific details of the computational model used. \nThe answer: the specific details of the computational model used.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework.\" This indicates that there are certain definitions that are too complex to fit into the typical framework for complexity classes. \nThe answer: Some complexity classes.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify the categories into which complexity classes are generally classified. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse different concepts, so we can eliminate options that are not related to complexity classes. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate options that are related to professions or nationalities. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can eliminate options that are not the opposite of complexity classes. Therefore, the answer is: easy, medium, and hard.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a variable that can cause difficulty in establishing a framework for complexity classes. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the answer is something that makes it easier to establish a framework for complexity classes. The answer is therefore not having a complicated definition.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because bounding the computation time above by a concrete function f(n) can result in different complexity classes depending on the chosen machine model. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking about the contingency of complexity classes on the concept of machine models. \nThe answer: chosen machine model", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the computation time of a multi-tape Turing machine to that of a single-tape Turing machine. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between machine models. \nThe answer: linear time", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" means that the specific details of the language being solved (i.e. \"xx | x is any binary string\") are not relevant to the answer. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" means that if a language can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, it necessarily requires quadratic time on a single-tape Turing machine. Therefore, the answer is a single-tape Turing machine. \nThe answer: single-tape Turing machine", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to the Cobham-Edmonds thesis, which states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related.\" This thesis specifies that a polynomial relationship exists within time complexities in a computational model. \nThe answer: Cobham-Edmonds thesis", "{3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the complexity class P, which is defined as the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. Rules 3 and 8 are relevant because they remind us that size and shape are different concepts, and that antonyms are important for understanding comparisons. Rule 16 is relevant because it reminds us that first comes before last and last comes after first, which helps us understand that P is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for understanding the meaning of a sentence, which helps us understand that P is the set of decision problems that can be solved within polynomial time. \nThe answer: P", "3, 7\nExplanation: The question asks for examples of measurements that are used to define complexity classes. Rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"measurements\" can be synonymous with \"bounding the time or space used by the algorithm.\" Therefore, the answer is \"time and space.\"", "{3}\nExplanation: The article states that time and space are used to define complexity classes, which implies that algorithms use these measurements to determine their efficiency.\nThe answer: Algorithms use time or space to define measurements of efficiency.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The article discusses how complexity classes of decision problems can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. This means that algorithms use measurements of time or space to define these classes. \nThe answer: complexity classes", "{2, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for three examples of complexity classes associated with definitions established by probabilistic Turing machines. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"examples\" as a synonym for \"three.\" Rule 7 applies because the answer requires identifying complexity classes associated with probabilistic Turing machines. \nThe answer: BPP, ZPP, and RP.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: AC and NC are defined using Boolean circuits, which fall under the concept of \"shape\" as opposed to \"profession\" or \"nationality\".\nThe answer: Boolean circuits", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: BQP and QMA are defined using quantum Turing machines, which are a type of computer that uses quantum mechanics to perform operations. This falls under rule 3, which states that different concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are distinct.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the expression used to represent a complexity class of counting problems. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about other complexity classes. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can focus on the sentence that directly answers the question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question is asking for a class of counting problems, not decision problems. \nThe answer: #P", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 7 and 17. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for the type of proof system used to define IP and AM, and the answer is \"Interactive proof systems.\" The word \"proof\" is a synonym for \"proof system,\" and the question uses the phrase \"type of proof system\" to indicate that the answer is a category or classification of proof systems. The question also uses the phrase \"most commonly defined\" to indicate that the answer is a general description of the method used to define IP and AM, rather than a specific technical detail. Finally, the question uses the phrase \"what type\" to indicate that the answer should be a noun or noun phrase.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: computation time", "{3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: We need to identify the expression that contains the complexity class DTIME(n). Rule 3 tells us that concepts like time are different from concepts like space, so we can ignore the mention of space in the passage. Rule 7 tells us that we can look for synonyms of the term we are interested in, which in this case is \"DTIME(n)\". Rule 12 tells us that some parts of the passage may be irrelevant to the answer. The relevant sentence is \"although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict.\" Therefore, the answer is \"DTIME(n2)\".", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the theorems that determine time and space requirements. Rule 3 tells us that size and shape are different concepts, so we can ignore any irrelevant details about the physical characteristics of the theorems. Rule 16 tells us that we should prioritize information about the time and space requirements of the theorems. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important, so we should pay attention to any language indicating that the theorems are responsible for determining what is not possible. The answer is the time and space hierarchy theorems. \n\nThe answer: time and space hierarchy theorems", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how time and space requirements are constrained by hierarchy theorems to induce a proper hierarchy on the complexity classes. The word \"resources\" in the question refers to time and space requirements. The negation in the question (\"constraining\" vs \"relaxing\") is also important. \nThe answer: a proper hierarchy on the complexity classes.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: quantitative statements about additional time or space needed", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the foundation for separation results within complexity classes, which is a concept related to computer science and not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are the most relevant. The answer is the time and space hierarchy theorems.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the time hierarchy theorem states that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, meaning that EXPTIME is more than P. Therefore, by rule 1, P is less than EXPTIME. Rule 3 applies to clarify that \"constraining\" refers to being strictly contained within a larger set. \nThe answer: EXPTIME", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 tells us that \"variable\" is a different concept from \"time\" and \"space\". Rule 12 tells us to ignore irrelevant passages in the context, so we can focus on the relevant information about the space hierarchy theorem. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"contained\". The answer: space.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The concept of reduction is frequently used to define complexity classes.\nThe answer: reduction", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem.\nThe answer: another problem", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: If X can be solved using an algorithm for Y, then X is no more difficult than Y, and we say that X reduces to Y. Therefore, X performs the function of being no more difficult than Y. \nThe answer: X is no more difficult than Y.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions Cook reductions, Karp reductions, and Levin reductions as different types of reductions. The question asks for two examples, so any two of these three types can be given as the answer.\nThe answer: Cook reductions and Karp reductions", "3, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that polynomial time reductions are the opposite of more difficult reductions. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question is asking for an example of a type of reduction, not a type of problem. \nThe answer: a type of reduction", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between two things, and the question asks for the most common type. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: polynomial-time reduction", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If squaring an integer can be reduced to multiplying two integers, and the reduction process takes polynomial time, then squaring an integer is not more difficult than multiplication. Therefore, a squared integer is equivalent to multiplying two integers. \nThe answer: Multiplying two integers.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Polynomial-time reduction means that the reduction process takes polynomial time.\nThe answer: polynomial time", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for what needs to remain constant in a multiplication algorithm to produce the same outcome when multiplying or squaring two integers. Rule 2 applies because squaring is a special case of multiplication, so the answer needs to take into account that relationship. Rule 8 applies because the question is asking about what needs to remain constant, which is the opposite of what changes. The answer is that the same input needs to be given to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that \"the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers.\" Therefore, squaring can ultimately be logically reduced to multiplication, which is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: multiplication", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the complexity of problems often depends on the type of reduction being used. This is an example of rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph.\nThe answer: the type of reduction being used", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: X being harder than any problem in C, since every problem in C can be reduced to X.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: If X is hard for a class of problems C, then every problem in C can be reduced to X. Therefore, an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. This is the essence of rule 3. Additionally, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks what we can do with an algorithm for X that reduces to C, which is the opposite of saying that every problem in C can be reduced to X. Therefore, we can infer that an algorithm for X that reduces to C allows us to solve any problem in C. \nThe answer: solve any problem in C", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.\" This means that a problem set that is hard for NP can also be stated as NP-hard.\nThe answer: NP-hard", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. This can be analogously written as \"the hardest problems in NP\". \nThe answer: NP-complete", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that \"likelihood\" is not related to size, shape, age, or color, and rule 8 to determine that \"lowest likelihood\" means the same as \"highest antonym(likelihood).\" Therefore, the answer is \"P.\"", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If a known NP-complete problem \u03a02 can be reduced to \u03a01, and P = NP is unsolved, then there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a01. Therefore, \u03a01 is also likely to be one of the hardest problems in NP and not in P. Additionally, if \u03a01 can be solved in polynomial time, then P = NP. \nThe answer: There is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a01.", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if a problem X is more difficult than problem Y, then Y is more antonym(difficult) than X, so if an NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then P is more antonym(difficult) than NP. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so P comes before NP. Therefore, if an NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then P = NP.\nThe answer: P = NP.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 establishes a relationship between two entities based on a comparative attribute. In this case, the attribute is efficiency in solving computational tasks, and the two entities are the complexity class P and efficient algorithms. Rule 3 establishes that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: P", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a hypothesis associated with P, which is a comparison between P and another complexity class (NP). Rule 3 applies because the question asks about a concept associated with P (mathematical abstraction with efficient algorithmic functionality). Rule 7 applies because the question uses the word \"hypothesis\" as a synonym for \"theory\" or \"idea\". \nThe answer: The Cobham-Edmonds thesis.", "{2, 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses the complexity class NP, which contains problems that people would like to solve efficiently but for which no efficient algorithm is known. This fits with rule 2, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. It also fits with rule 3, which distinguishes between different concepts such as complexity classes and unknown algorithms. Rule 4 is relevant in distinguishing between profession and nationality, which is not applicable in this context. Rule 7 is relevant in identifying synonyms in the question. Rule 17 is relevant in identifying the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: NP", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the NP complexity class contains problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known. The passage also gives examples of such problems, including the Boolean satisfiability problem, the Hamiltonian path problem, and the vertex cover problem. Therefore, the answer is any of these three problems. \nThe answer: Boolean satisfiability problem, Hamiltonian path problem, or vertex cover problem.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that deterministic Turing machines are a subset of non-deterministic Turing machines, and therefore any problem that can be solved efficiently by a deterministic Turing machine (i.e. in the class P) is also a member of the class NP. This applies to all problems in P, so the answer is \"deterministic Turing machines\". \nThe answer: deterministic Turing machines", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: If P equals NP, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. Therefore, the efficiency of problems would increase.\nThe answer: problems would become more efficient.", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"protein structure prediction in biology\" is one of the problems that would have more efficient solutions if P = NP. \nThe answer: protein structure prediction", "{3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: We need to identify the prize offered for finding a solution to P=NP. The passage states that \"There is a US$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.\" Therefore, we can use rule 3 to understand that \"prize\" is a different concept than \"solution\" and rule 7 to identify \"resolving the problem\" as a synonym for \"finding a solution.\" Finally, we can use rule 12 to ignore any irrelevant information and output the answer: US$1,000,000. \nThe answer: US$1,000,000.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: If P = NP, then all NP problems are in P, which means there are no NP-intermediate problems. Therefore, if there are NP-intermediate problems, then P \u2260 NP. \nThe answer: Ladner", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If P \u2260 NP, then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete, and these problems are called NP-intermediate problems. If a problem meets Ladner's assertion, then it is an NP-intermediate problem.\nThe answer: NP-intermediate problem", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 17}\nExplanation: These rules cover comparisons between different concepts and the importance of negations. \nThe answer: The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the integer factorization problem.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the graph isomorphism problem", "{1, 2, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a class that the graph isomorphism problem is not commonly ascribed to, despite a definitive determination. Rule 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and degrees of certainty. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts. Rule 8 is relevant because it deals with antonyms. Rule 17 is relevant because it deals with negations. \nThe answer: NP-complete", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for what hierarchy implies that the graph isomorphism problem is NP-complete, which is a negation. Therefore, rule 3 applies, which states that negations are important for the answer. Additionally, rule 8 applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The passage states that if the graph isomorphism problem is NP-complete, then the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Therefore, the answer is that the polynomial time hierarchy collapsing to its second level implies that the graph isomorphism problem is NP-complete.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: If the graph isomorphism problem is NP-complete, then the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. This is because NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP, and if they can be solved in polynomial time, then all problems in NP can be solved in polynomial time, which would collapse the hierarchy to its second level. \nThe answer: second level", "{3, 4, 7, 13, 16, 17, 18}\nExplanation: We need to identify the people associated with the algorithm, which is a profession and therefore different from nationality. We also need to pay attention to negations in the question. \nThe answer: Laszlo Babai and Eugene Luks", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The rules selected are 1 (comparative relationships), 3 (different concepts), and 4 (different concepts). The question asks about a computational problem associated with prime factorization, which is a concept related to mathematics and computer science. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply to ensure that the answer is related to the same concept. Rule 1 applies because the question mentions \"commonly associated,\" implying a comparative relationship. \nThe answer: The integer factorization problem.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about determining the value of an input, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about a comparison of the input value to a variable, specifically if it is less than that variable. Therefore, the answer is \"k\".", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The article states that the fact that no efficient integer factorization algorithm is known forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. This means that the lack of a solution to the integer factorization problem is a fundamental aspect of the RSA cryptographic system.\nThe answer: RSA cryptographic system", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the efficiency of different algorithms. Rule 3 applies because size is a concept relevant to the problem. Rule 8 applies because it compares the efficiency of different algorithms. \nThe answer: general number field sieve", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The unproven assumption is that certain complexity classes are unequal. This relates to rule 1 because if A is a complexity class and B is another complexity class, and A is suspected to be unequal to B, then B is suspected to be unequal to A. This also relates to rule 3 because complexity classes are different concepts. Finally, this relates to rule 8 because if A is suspected to be unequal to B, then B is suspected to be more antonym(equal) than A, and A is suspected to be less antonym(equal) than B. \nThe answer: The unproven assumption is that certain complexity classes are unequal.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If A is more complex than B, then B is more simple than A. The suspected inequality of complexity classes can be expressed as \"P is not equal to NP, and if P is not equal to NP, then P is not equal to PSPACE either.\" \nThe answer: \"P is not equal to NP, and if P is not equal to NP, then P is not equal to PSPACE either.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are many known complexity classes between P and PSPACE, including RP, BPP, PP, BQP, MA, PH, etc. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can't assume that the classes are physically located somewhere. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the classes are not located within each other, but rather they are distinct and separate. \nThe answer: between P and PSPACE", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking about what would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any information about those. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that two complexity classes are unequal, we can infer that they are not the same. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we can infer that proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory. \nThe answer: Proving that any of the known complexity classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" means that the concept of complement problems is not related to the concept of NP problems, so we cannot assume that they are in the same complexity class. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" means that if NP problems are in a certain complexity class, then their complement problems are in the opposite complexity class. Therefore, the answer is co-NP. \nThe answer: co-NP", "{rule list: 17}\nExplanation: Negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for the reversed answer. \nThe answer: reversed", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because the question asks about the relationship between P and co-NP, which are complements of each other. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" does not apply because it is not relevant to the question. \nThe answer: If P is not equal to co-NP, then P is not equal to NP.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: If P and co-NP are established to be unequal, then it implies that NP is also not equal to co-NP. This would mean that P is not equal to NP, as NP is a subset of co-NP.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those options. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if a problem can be solved in logarithmic space, it means that it requires less space than problems that cannot be solved in logarithmic space. Therefore, the answer is space. \nThe answer: space.", "1, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if L is a subset of P, then P is a superset of L. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the relationship between L and P, and if L is a subset of P, then P is a superset of L, and vice versa. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the commonly ascribed attributes of L in relation to P, and the use of \"though unknown\" implies a negation. \nThe answer: It is not known if L is strictly contained in P or equal to P.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for what lies between L and P that prevents a definitive determination of their relationship. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so we cannot assume that any other complexity class lies between L and P. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we cannot definitively determine the relationship between L and P, it must be because there are complexity classes that are more antonym(L) than P and more antonym(P) than L. The only complexity classes that fit this description are NL and NC, so the answer is NL and NC. \nThe answer: NL and NC.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any potential confusion between the terms \"between\" and \"among\" in the question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to infer that there are two complexity classes between L and P, rather than just one. \nThe answer: NL and NC", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about what is unknown about the relationship between the complexity classes between L and P. Rule 3 states that size and complexity are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer is that it is not known if the complexity classes between L and P are distinct or equal. \nThe answer: It is not known if the complexity classes between L and P are distinct or equal.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a term that describes a situation where a problem takes too long to be useful, which implies that there are other problems that can be solved more quickly. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking for a concept or term, not a physical attribute like size or color. \nThe answer: Intractable problems.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Intractable problems lacking polynomial time solutions negate the practical efficacy of exponential-time algorithms. This is because even for small inputs, the running time of an exponential-time algorithm can be so large that it is unusable in practice. A polynomial time algorithm, on the other hand, is considered to be efficient and practical, but even a polynomial time algorithm with a high degree (e.g. n^15) may still be impractical for large inputs. \nThe answer: exponential-time algorithms", "3, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if NP is not equal to P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so if NP is equal to P, then the NP-complete problems are not intractable. \nThe answer: NP-complete problems", "{3, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a specific type of arithmetic that presents a decision problem not in P. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts like size and shape are different, so we can't assume that arithmetic is the same as other decision problems. Rule 7 reminds us that synonyms may be used in the question, so \"eponymous variation\" can be understood as \"named after someone.\" Rule 8 tells us that if a problem is not in P, then it is hard, and if one case is hard, then most cases are hard. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to look for a problem that is not in P. \nThe answer: Presburger arithmetic.", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that even though the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Therefore, despite the existence of the Presburger problem, solutions have been established in reasonable periods of time. \nThe answer: Algorithms have been written to solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases.", "{2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that just because a problem is not in P does not mean that all large cases of the problem are hard. The example given is the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic, which has been shown not to be in P but algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Therefore, the answer is the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic.", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" applies because the question asks about the speed of an algorithm in solving the problem, which implies that the answer should be a measure of time. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the passage states that algorithms can solve the problem \"in less than quadratic time,\" which implies that the answer should be a measure of time that is faster than quadratic time. \nThe answer: less than quadratic time", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for an example of a problem with large instances that is routinely solved by SAT handlers employing efficient algorithms. Rule 3 reminds us that size is a different concept from intractability, so just because a problem is large doesn't mean it's necessarily hard. Rule 8 tells us that if a problem A is more efficient than problem B, then problem B is less efficient than problem A. Therefore, the answer is the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: Researchers laid out numerous foundations before the actual research on the complexity of algorithmic problems started. \nThe answer: They laid out numerous foundations.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the most influential researcher among those grappling with the deficit of work surrounding the complexity posed by algorithmic problems. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the article is discussing multiple researchers. Rule 23 tells us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1936\" is in the passive voice, so we can infer that Alan Turing was the most influential researcher. \nThe answer: Alan Turing", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Alan Turing is credited with defining Turing machines, which are a theoretical device used to simplify and study the complexity of algorithms. The mention of \"flexible simplification of a computer\" also suggests that Turing machines are a theoretical concept rather than a physical device.\nThe answer: Turing machines", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the year in which Alan Turing's definitional model of a computing device was received. The passage states that Turing machines were defined by Alan Turing in 1936, which implies that this was the year in which his definitional model was received.\nThe answer: 1936", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size and shape are different, and rule 23 states that a Turing machine is a concept related to computing. Therefore, the answer should focus on the concept being emulated by a Turing machine, rather than any specific size or shape. \nThe answer: a computer", "{1, 3, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (comparative statements), 3 (different concepts), 6 (different concepts), and 13 (names are important). The answer is \"On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms\" by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms\" was authored by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns, so we need to pay attention to names and their order.\nThe answer: Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Hatmanis and Stearn's paper \"On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms\" was published in 1965. This is a simple question of identifying the year in which the work was received.\nThe answer: 1965", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms\" laid out the definitions of time and space complexity. According to rule 3, size is a different concept from other concepts, so time and space complexity are not the same as measurements of size. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, if the paper defined time and space complexity, then the answer is that the paper did not define measurements of size. \nThe answer: The paper did not define measurements of size.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Edmonds characterized a \"good\" algorithm in 1965, as stated in the passage.\nThe answer: 1965", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question specifically asks for the name of the person who provided the definition. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: John Myhill", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions Raymond Smullyan's study of rudimentary sets in 1961, so the answer is 1961.\nThe answer: 1961", "{7, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the author of a paper on real-time computations published in 1962. The relevant sentence states \"Hisao Yamada's paper on real-time computations (1962).\" The answer is Hisao Yamada. \nThe answer: Hisao Yamada", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the concrete choice typically assumed by most complexity-theoretic theorems is not relevant to the answer. Therefore, the answer is: the concrete choice of input encoding.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding.\" This means that the choice of input encoding is typically left independent in order to maintain a level of abstraction.\nThe answer: choice of input encoding", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about whether the question is asking for the nationality of the person responsible for axiomatic complexity theory. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps identify that Manuel Blum is the person responsible for axiomatic complexity theory.\nThe answer: Manuel Blum", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: speed-up theorem", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\"", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer is found in the sentence \"In 1972, Richard Karp took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, 'Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems', in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.\" The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). \nThe answer: 21", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that teachers use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning, providing a course of study which is called the curriculum. The use of the word \"called\" indicates that the answer is a synonym or definition of \"curriculum.\" Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so these are not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in the question or passage. \nThe answer: curriculum", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: \"pedagogy\" is a synonym for the science of teaching.\nThe answer: pedagogy", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: from a university or college", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that teachers may use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning. \nThe answer: a lesson plan", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that the role of a teacher is often carried out at a school or other place of formal education, indicating that a teacher is most likely to be teaching at a formal educational institution.\nThe answer: a school or other place of formal education", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also not relevant. However, the rule that \"a person's role may vary among cultures\" is relevant, as it explains that cultural differences can impact a teacher's role. Additionally, the rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is not relevant. \nThe answer: Cultural differences", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Literacy is a concept related to education and language. Therefore, other concepts related to education and language, such as numeracy, may be similar to literacy. \nThe answer: numeracy", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Vocational training is a type of training that focuses on developing skills for a specific profession or trade. This is similar to craftsmanship, which also involves developing skills for a specific trade or craft.\nThe answer: Craftsmanship", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that teachers may provide instruction in \"life skills,\" which would be the most helpful for everyday life.\nThe answer: life skills", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that formal education through home schooling can be assisted by \"a family member, or by anyone with knowledge or skills in the wider community setting.\" This means that a family member is most likely to teach a child at home.\nThe answer: a family member", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because home schooling is a type of formal education that takes place at the student's home, so the student's home is more specifically the place of education. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking for a specific term to describe this type of education. \nThe answer: home schooling", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Home schooling is a form of formal education that takes place at home, which is a different setting than traditional schools.\nThe answer: formal education", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The opposite of an ongoing role of teaching would be a transient role of teaching.\nThe answer: transient role", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: knowledge or skills", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions several specific titles for religious teachers, such as gurus, mullahs, rabbis, pastors/youth pastors, and lamas. However, the question asks for a general name for a religious teacher. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we cannot use any of the specific titles mentioned in the article as the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can infer that the question is asking for a general term that could apply to any religious teacher, regardless of their specific title or religion. Therefore, the answer is \"clergy\" or \"religious leader\". \nThe answer: clergy/religious leader", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions religious texts such as the Quran, Torah, and Bible, indicating that these are different texts associated with different religions.\nThe answer: Quran is a religious text.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"religion and nationality are different concepts\" (rule 4) means that the nationality of the text is irrelevant to the answer. The rule that \"texts are different from religious figures\" (rule 3) means that the name of the religious figure is irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Quran, Torah, or Bible.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the question mentions \"religious and spiritual teachers\" does not affect the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can infer that the question is asking about the specific individuals who would teach from these texts. Therefore, the answer is: gurus, mullahs, rabbis, pastors/youth pastors, and lamas.", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: Homeschooling is a form of teaching that is carried out informally within the family. This falls under the category of formal teaching, which can also be carried out by paid professionals. \nThe answer: Homeschooling", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that formal teaching may be carried out by paid professionals who enjoy a status in some societies on a par with physicians, lawyers, engineers, and accountants. This suggests that professionals in these fields are most likely to be doing formal teaching.\nThe answer: paid professionals", "{rule list: 4}\nExplanation: The rule states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the question is asking for a different type of accountant, not a different nationality of CPA.\nThe answer: There is no answer to the question as it is based on a false premise.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Informal teaching may be carried out in the wider community. This is in addition to teaching within the family, as stated in the article.\nThe answer: the wider community", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, the answer is \"paid professionals\". \nThe answer: Paid professionals", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that teachers can help with the organization of school functions, which is a task outside of formal teaching. This is an example of rule 3, which states that profession and tasks are different concepts. The passage also mentions that teachers can serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities, which is another task outside of formal teaching. This is an example of rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Finally, the question asks for a synonym of \"school functions,\" which is mentioned in the passage as one of the tasks that teachers can help organize. This is an example of rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph.\nThe answer: School functions.", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that teachers may serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities, which implies that these activities would require a teacher to take on a supervisor role.\nThe answer: extracurricular activities", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Therefore, we can infer that \"studying\" refers to \"extracurricular activities\" mentioned in the article. The rule that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: Extracurricular activities.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Profession and responsibility are related concepts, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Teachers", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that \"Around the world many governments operate teacher's colleges,\" which indicates that governments run teacher's colleges. \nThe answer: teacher's colleges", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: A teacher's college would exist to certify, govern, and enforce the standards of practice for the teaching profession, serving and protecting the public interest.\nThe answer: To certify, govern, and enforce the standards of practice for the teaching profession, serving and protecting the public interest.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 and 17, which state that profession and negations are important for the answer. The question asks who a teacher's college would be protecting, implying that the college is protecting someone. Since the article mentions that teacher's colleges are established to serve and protect the public interest, the answer is the public. \nThe answer: the public", "{4, 19}\nExplanation: Teacher's colleges are established to certify, govern, and enforce the standards of practice for the teaching profession, so it can be inferred that those who are taught at teacher's colleges are individuals who aspire to become teachers. Gender is irrelevant to the profession of teaching.\nThe answer: individuals aspiring to become teachers", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from profession and nationality. Teacher's colleges are related to the profession of teaching, not to any of the other concepts.\nThe answer: standards of practice", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that teacher's colleges may investigate complaints involving members and conduct hearings into allegations of professional misconduct. This implies that teachers could be the subjects of a teacher's college investigation.\nThe answer: teachers", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The teacher's colleges may investigate complaints involving members and conduct hearings into allegations of professional misconduct. Negations are important for the answer because the question asks for what someone could be investigated for. \nThe answer: Professional misconduct", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is a member in good standing with the college, then the college is the entity that requires teachers to be members in good standing. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between the profession of teaching and the entity responsible for regulating it. Rule 13 applies because it emphasizes that names are important for the answer, and in this case, the entity is referred to as \"the college.\" \nThe answer: the college", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the functions of teacher's colleges, which may include taking disciplinary action against teachers. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including the concept of disciplinary action. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and other concepts. Rule 5 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and other concepts. Rule 6 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and vehicles. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The teacher's college.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article discusses the functions of teacher's colleges and mentions that one of their functions is accrediting teacher education programs. This falls under the category of profession, which is different from nationality, and the article also does not mention any specific names or locations. Therefore, rules 3, 4, and 16 are the most relevant.\nThe answer: teacher's colleges", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that a teacher may teach \"perhaps in another environment such as outdoors.\" \nThe answer: Outdoors.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for the name of a teacher who teaches just one person, which can be rephrased as \"What is the name for a teacher who does not teach a group of people?\" The answer is \"tutor,\" which is a teacher who teaches on an individual basis.", "{3, 4, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The rules state that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) and \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" (3), so the location of a teacher is not related to their profession. The question asks for an indoor location, so the irrelevant information about outdoor environments can be ignored (12). The answer is \"no answer\" as the article only mentions indoor locations in passing and does not provide a specific answer to the question.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that \"facilitating student learning\" is a characteristic that can be compared between teachers. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between the profession of teaching and the nationality of the teacher.\nThe answer: Teachers facilitate student learning.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that learning can be either informal or formal. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate options that refer to those concepts. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"informal\" in the article. The answer is \"informal approach to learning.\" \nThe answer: Informal approach to learning.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"Different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy.\" This is a term used to describe the methods and approaches used to instruct students.\nThe answer: pedagogy", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips, indicating that learning outside of the classroom is possible. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that learning is not inside of the classroom does not change its name. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for a synonym for \"learning that is not inside of the classroom.\" \nThe answer: learning outside of the classroom", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The article discusses different ways of teaching, including the use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet. This falls under rule 3, as technology is a different concept from teaching methods, and rule 7, as \"started to change\" is a synonym for \"begun to shape.\" \nThe answer: the increasing use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the increasing use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet, as a factor that has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom. This is a negation question, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. The answer is \"the internet\". \nThe answer: the internet", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the objective can be a practical skill, so any objective related to a practical skill would be labeled as practical.\nThe answer: a practical skill.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant authority would determine the standardized curricula. This falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The relevant authority is not specified in the article, but it can be inferred that it is a governing body or educational institution. \nThe answer: the relevant authority", "{3, 4, 19}\nExplanation: Disabilities are not related to size, shape, age, or color, and are not related to profession or nationality. A person's gender is also irrelevant to their disability. \nThe answer: learning disability", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that a teacher may interact with students of different ages, including infants, so the youngest student a teacher might have is an infant.\nThe answer: an infant", "{4, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 and 12, which state that profession and irrelevant passages are not important for the answer. The answer is: standardized curricula.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that teaching using pedagogy involves assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. Therefore, the answer is: particular skills.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Learning is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color, so rule 3 applies. The passage states that \"the real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving,\" indicating that most of the learning takes place through individual effort and problem-solving. Rule 16 applies as \"bulk\" implies that this is the main or largest area of learning.\nThe answer: self-study and problem solving", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The profession of the teacher is mentioned, indicating that profession and not nationality is relevant. The word \"encourage\" implies a positive action, so the negation rule is not relevant. However, the word \"timid\" is a negation, so rule 17 is relevant.\nThe answer: Encourage them.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The word \"cocky\" refers to a person's attitude or behavior, which is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 17 also applies, which states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks what a teacher would do for someone who is \"cocky\", which implies that the teacher would do something to address or correct this behavior. \nThe answer: deflate the cocky", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it helps us understand that the function being described comes after the description of the teacher's role. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer is: a coach.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison between primary and secondary school teaching relationships. Rule 3 applies because the answer refers to the difference in the relationship between teachers and children, which is a concept distinct from size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: In primary schools, each class has one teacher who stays with them for most of the week and teaches them the whole curriculum, while in secondary schools, students are taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers. The relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in primary school.", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: In primary schools, each class has a teacher who teaches them the whole curriculum.\nThe answer: the whole curriculum", "{3, 16, 19}\nExplanation: Rule 3 distinguishes between different concepts, including the concepts of \"primary school\" and \"secondary school.\" Rule 16 establishes that in the context of this article, \"secondary school\" comes after \"primary school.\" Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can assume that both male and female teachers may teach in secondary schools.\nThe answer: different subject specialists", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Primary schools have a closer teacher-child relationship.\nThe answer: primary school", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" (16) is relevant because it helps us understand that the teacher is taking on the role of a surrogate parent. \nThe answer: surrogate parent", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from profession and nationality. Therefore, the answer cannot be about any of these concepts. Additionally, the question is asking about alternative approaches for primary education, which is a concept related to education and not profession or nationality. \nThe answer: \"platoon\" system", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer is referring to an educational system, not a profession or nationality. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also not relevant. The answer is referring to a system of education, not physical attributes. The relevant rule is that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A.\" The answer is referring to a system where students move from one specialist to another for each subject, which is called a \"platoon\" system. Therefore, the answer is: platoon system.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in a platoon system, students stay with the same group of peers for all classes, which gives them a strong sense of security.\nThe answer: staying with the same group of peers for all classes", "{2, 3}\nExplanation: In a platoon system, students move from one specialist teacher to another for each subject. This means that the teachers are more knowledgeable in their specific subject area than a teacher who teaches multiple subjects. \nThe answer: knowledgeable in their specific subject area", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: This question is asking for the country being discussed in the article. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of teaching subjects. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. Therefore, we can simply output \"United States\". \nThe answer: United States", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The article discusses a new trend in teaching called co-teaching, where two or more teachers work together to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom. This is a different approach from traditional teaching methods where one teacher is responsible for the entire class. This trend is mentioned in the first sentence of the article.\nThe answer: Co-teaching", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that co-teaching involves \"two or more teachers\" working together. \nThe answer: Two or more teachers", "{3, 4, 5, 6}\nExplanation: These rules establish that concepts such as size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles are different and cannot be confused. Therefore, the answer cannot be \"size\", \"shape\", \"age\", \"color\", \"profession\", \"nationality\", \"animals\", or \"vehicles\". The only concept left in the question is \"learning\", which is what co-teaching gets the students to focus on.\nThe answer: learning", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because co-teachers work together harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student. Rule 4 applies because co-teachers are both teachers. \nThe answer: Co-teachers work harmoniously together.", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Co-teaching provides social networking support. \nThe answer: social networking support", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 and 13, which state that profession and names are equally important for the answer. The passage mentions that the most common form of school discipline was corporal punishment, so the answer is: corporal punishment.", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"a teacher was expected to act as a substitute parent, with all the normal forms of parental discipline open to them.\" This indicates that the teacher's role was to discipline the child as a parent would. \nThe answer: to act as a substitute parent and discipline the child.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that the teacher had access to \"all the normal forms of parental discipline.\" This implies that the teacher had access to a variety of disciplinary methods, which could include verbal reprimands, detention, extra assignments, and physical punishment. However, it is important to note that the passage specifically mentions corporal punishment as the most common form of school discipline throughout history.\nThe answer: All the normal forms of parental discipline, including corporal punishment.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Corporal punishment is the most common form of school discipline throughout history. The use of the word \"most\" implies that there are other forms of school discipline, so rule 3 applies. The question asks about the frequency of corporal punishment, so negations are not important, but the question is asking for a level of commonality, so rule 17 applies.\nThe answer: most common", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: A teacher was expected to act as a substitute parent, which means they could use all the normal forms of parental discipline. This implies that a teacher could act in the role of a parent while a child was in school.\nThe answer: while a child was in school", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Corporal punishment was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world in the past.\nThe answer: very/common", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the presence or absence of corporal punishment in different regions. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concept of corporal punishment and other concepts such as verbal reprimands. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between the concept of corporal punishment and the concept of a country or region. Rule 8 applies because it establishes a relationship between the presence or absence of corporal punishment in different regions. Rule 17 applies because it establishes a negation in the question. \nThe answer: Most Western countries (and some others) have banned it.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The question asks for a Western country where corporal punishment is still allowed, implying that it has been banned in most Western countries. Therefore, we can use rule 1 to infer that the answer is a Western country where corporal punishment is less common than in other countries. Rule 4 tells us that nationality is not relevant, so we can focus on the country itself. Finally, rule 17 tells us that the negation \"still allowed\" is important, meaning that the answer is a Western country where corporal punishment has not been banned. The answer is the United States. \n\nThe answer: United States", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the U.S. entity that said corporal punishment was Constitutional, which implies that there was some controversy or disagreement about its legality. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that it was a U.S. entity is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and the question includes the word \"not\" in the form of \"did not violate.\" Therefore, the answer is the US Supreme Court. \nThe answer: US Supreme Court", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Corporal punishment causes physical pain to a student.\nThe answer: physical pain", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: We can use rule 1 to infer that if some states have not banned corporal punishment, then the others have. Rule 3 tells us that the concept of \"banning\" is different from \"practicing\" corporal punishment. Finally, rule 8 tells us that if some states do not practice corporal punishment, then the others do. Therefore, the answer is 20 (50 - 30). \nThe answer: 20", "{1, 2, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that corporal punishment is still used to a significant degree in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, and that private schools in these and most other states may also use it. Therefore, the answer is the South. \nThe answer: the South", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If corporal punishment is declining in some states, then it must be increasing in others. The use of \"though declining\" implies that the trend is towards less use of corporal punishment. \nThe answer: declining", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"objects and tools are different concepts\" applies here. The passage mentions that a \"specially made wooden paddle\" is used for corporal punishment in American schools, so the answer is \"wooden paddle\".\nThe answer: wooden paddle", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal's office.\" This indicates that corporal punishment is usually performed in the principal's office, which is a specific location. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that \"nowadays\" refers to the present time. \nThe answer: in the principal's office", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"often by caning\" is a common form of corporal punishment in schools in some countries.\nThe answer: Caning", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it allows us to understand that if corporal punishment is commonplace in some countries, then it is less common or not practiced in others. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that countries are not a concept related to size, shape, age, or color, but rather a different concept altogether. Rule 7 applies because the question asks for \"countries\" but the article uses the term \"individual countries.\" \nThe answer: some Asian, African, and Caribbean countries", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that for details on individual countries' practices of corporal punishment in schools, one should see the page titled \"School corporal punishment.\" This indicates that the information can be found on a separate page or resource, and therefore falls under rule 3 (different concepts). Additionally, the mention of a specific page implies that names are important for the answer, falling under rule 13. \nThe answer: School corporal punishment page", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: Profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4), so the fact that Singapore is mentioned does not necessarily mean that the answer is related to a profession. Therefore, we only need to apply rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. \"Punishment\" is a synonym for \"detention,\" which is mentioned in the article as a common punishment in Singapore. \nThe answer: detention", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that the answer cannot be \"detention\" as it is not a profession or nationality. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is also not relevant. \nThe answer: detention", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: This question is asking for the location of where a pupil remains during detention. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the location of the pupil during detention is not related to any of these concepts. \nThe answer: in a classroom", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the way the student is required to sit is not related to any of these concepts. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which means that we need to focus on the word \"just\" in the question. Therefore, the answer is: \"sit quietly\".", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any possible confusion about what the student might be asked to write. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is also relevant, as the question specifies that the student is asked to write something, rather than not to write something. \nThe answer: They write lines or a punishment essay.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Profession is a relevant concept and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: an assertive teacher", "{rule list: 2}\nExplanation: This rule states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, the passage states that positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior, indicating that they are both equally important in maintaining discipline.\nThe answer: immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts.\" Boundaries are not related to any of these concepts, so they must be a different type of concept. Therefore, the answer is: firm, clear boundaries.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline.\nThe answer: Sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Teachers are expected to respect their students, and sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline.\nThe answer: respect", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for who wants a more confrontational type of discipline, which implies a negation. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 2 states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. Therefore, the answer is: Some teachers and parents.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying countries that combine strict discipline with high standards of education. Rule 3 states that concepts such as discipline and education are different. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different, so the answer cannot be a profession. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can look for countries that are known for strict discipline and high educational standards. The answer is East Asian countries.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Critics think that the cause of problems with modern schooling is the weakness in school discipline.\nThe answer: weakness in school discipline", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Critics want to see a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline. This is a negation of the consensus viewpoint that advocates for a less strict approach to discipline. Rule 1 applies because the two styles of discipline are opposite in nature. Rule 3 applies because the type of discipline is a different concept from the problems with modern schooling. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the type of discipline that critics want, which is the antonym of the consensus viewpoint. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"want,\" which implies a negation of the consensus viewpoint. \nThe answer: More assertive and confrontational style of discipline.", "{1, 2, 7, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"average attainment on standardized tests may exceed those in Western countries\" in Japan. This implies that Japan has higher scores on standardized tests than the U.S. despite the fact that the article does not explicitly mention the U.S. as a comparison. \nThe answer: Japan", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a country with unmanageable students and lack of discipline, which is a negation of the official rigid codes of behavior. Therefore, rules 3 (distinguishing between concepts), 8 (antonyms), and 17 (negations) are relevant. \nThe answer: Japan", "{2, 3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a country that has high test scores but problematic classroom discipline. Rule 2 applies because it clarifies that high test scores do not necessarily mean that educational goals are the same across cultures. Rule 3 applies because it emphasizes that discipline and test scores are different concepts. Rule 4 applies because it highlights that nationality and country are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Japan", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"officially, schools have extremely rigid codes of behavior\" in this country, implying that the codes of behavior are very strict. Additionally, the use of the word \"although\" suggests that there may be a contrast between the strict codes of behavior and the actual behavior of the students. \nThe answer: Japan", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size is a concept that affects the ability to maintain order in a classroom. If class A has a larger size than class B, then it is more difficult to maintain order in class A than in class B. \nThe answer: class sizes of 40 to 50 students.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because maintaining order in the classroom is more important than instruction, so instruction is less important than maintaining order. Rule 3 applies because maintaining order and instruction are different concepts. \nThe answer: instruction", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: If teachers concentrate their attention on motivated students, then they may ignore attention-seeking and disruptive students. This means that teachers prioritize attention on motivated students. \nThe answer: motivated students", "{1, 3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because motivated students are more focused than attention-seeking and disruptive students. Rule 3 applies because motivation is different from behavior. Rule 4 applies because profession is different from behavior. Rule 17 applies because the question asks who may be ignored, implying that some students may be neglected. \nThe answer: attention-seeking and disruptive students", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If teachers concentrate their attention on motivated students, then attention-seeking and disruptive students receive less attention and resources. Therefore, motivated students end up getting more of the teacher's resources.\nThe answer: motivated students", "{rule list: 1, 2, 4}\nExplanation: Sudbury schools prefer popularly based authority, where rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole, rather than dictatorial authority. This is because they believe that community discipline prevails when laws are fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws is in place. This creates an atmosphere of persuasion and negotiation rather than confrontation. \nThe answer: popularly based authority", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage only mentions schools as an example of where popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority. Therefore, we can use rule 4 to infer that schools and other entities (such as governments) are different concepts, and rule 7 to infer that synonyms for \"schools\" cannot be used to answer the question. As a result, there is no answer to this question based on the given passage.", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: The Sudbury model democratic schools claim that the atmosphere in a school using popularly based authority is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront. This is because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole. Therefore, the answer is an atmosphere of persuasion and negotiation. \nThe answer: an atmosphere of persuasion and negotiation", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Popularly based authority is claimed to maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority, and rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole. This creates an atmosphere of persuasion and negotiation rather than confrontation, resulting in a school where community discipline prevails. The negation in the question (\"what is public order like?\") indicates that the answer should be the opposite of what might be expected, so the answer is that public order is not chaotic or disorderly, but rather easier and more efficient to preserve than anywhere else. \nThe answer: Public order is easier and more efficient to preserve than anywhere else.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: good, clear laws", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Teachers who show enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials. Therefore, a teacher must show enthusiasm towards the course materials for increased learning.\nThe answer: enthusiasm", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and degrees of a quality, which is important in understanding the transfer of enthusiasm from teacher to student. Rule 17 is relevant because it deals with negations, which is important in understanding what is not transferred to students. \nThe answer: passion/enthusiasm for the course materials", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: These teachers do not teach by rote, meaning they do not simply repeat information without variation or creativity. They also do not show little enthusiasm for the course materials. \nThe answer: teach by rote and show little enthusiasm for the course materials.", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: Enthusiastic teachers tend to affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials and transfer their passion to receptive students. Students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who didn't show much enthusiasm for the course materials, so they rate them positively.\nThe answer: positively", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 apply because the article discusses the correlation between teacher enthusiasm and student motivation, and how enthusiastic teachers can lead to more engaged and interested students. Rule 3 applies because the article specifically mentions nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing and emotional facial expressions, as factors that increase student motivation. \nThe answer: Teacher enthusiasm, particularly nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm such as demonstrative gesturing and emotional facial expressions.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom. This implies that they did this more often than students who did not have an enthusiastic teacher.\nThe answer: Read lecture material outside of the classroom more often.", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: Dramatic gesturing is an example of nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm.\nThe answer: nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"controlled, experimental studies\" that explored intrinsic motivation of college students.\nThe answer: controlled, experimental studies", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn. The use of \"result\" indicates a cause and effect relationship, which falls under rule 2. The question specifically asks for the \"kind\" of levels of motivation, which implies a negation, making rule 17 relevant. \nThe answer: higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn", "{1, 2, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparative concepts, which are present in the question. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for synonyms to be present in the question. Rule 17 is relevant because it deals with negations. \nThe answer: self-determined", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Enthusiasm may act as a \"motivational embellishment\"; increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material.\nThe answer: variety, novelty, and surprise", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The term for catching the motivation expressed by the teacher is \"emotional contagion.\" This is in line with rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, and rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: emotional contagion", "{1, 2, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because teacher enthusiasm can create a classroom atmosphere that is more energetic and engaging, which can lead to higher levels of student interest. Rule 2 applies because teacher enthusiasm can make the subject matter more interesting and exciting, which can increase student motivation. Rule 3 applies because the concept of mere exposure suggests that students' expectations about intrinsic motivation can be influenced by the teacher's enthusiasm. Rule 7 applies because the question asks for a cause of higher student interest, which is a synonym for motivation. \nThe answer: Teacher enthusiasm can create a classroom atmosphere full of energy and enthusiasm which feed student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships. Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. \nThe answer: Student-teacher relationships", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if enthusiastic teachers create beneficial relationships with their students, then students have positive attitudes towards school and are more motivated. Rule 3 applies because personal achievement and academic success are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the type of relationships, and the passage specifically mentions \"beneficial relations\" that enthusiastic teachers create with their students. \nThe answer: beneficial relations", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the goals he receives from his superior", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding the difference between personal and academic goals, and how a teacher can guide a student in aligning them. Rule 3 emphasizes that concepts such as personal and academic goals are distinct and should not be confused. Rule 4 emphasizes that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is not directly relevant to this question, but serves as a reminder that different concepts should be treated as such. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is relevant because the question asks what a teacher should guide a student in, implying that the student needs guidance in this area. \nThe answer: aligning his personal goals with his academic goals.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Good student-teacher relationships are strongly linked to student motivation and attitudes towards school.\nThe answer: student motivation and attitudes towards school", "{1, 2, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the type of teachers that students are more interested in. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Therefore, we can infer that students are less interested in teachers who are not friendly and supportive. Rule 2 tells us that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. Therefore, we can infer that students are most interested in teachers who are friendly and supportive. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is also not relevant to this question.\nThe answer: friendly and supportive teachers", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: If teachers are friendly and supportive, students are likely to build stronger relations with them. Teachers who spend more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers. Therefore, students build stronger relationships with friendly, supportive, and interactive teachers. \nThe answer: friendly, supportive, and interactive teachers", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Supportive teachers spend more time interacting and working directly with students.\nThe answer: Interacting and working directly with students.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" applies because the passage states that effective teachers \"allow humor into their classroom,\" indicating that humor is a significant part of their teaching style. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" also applies because the question asks for the type of teacher for whom humor is a part of the classroom, implying that there may be other types of teachers for whom humor is not a part of the classroom. \nThe answer: effective teachers", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The second aspect of teacher enthusiasm is enthusiasm about the students. This is because a teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future. This falls under rule 1 because it is a comparison between two concepts (enthusiasm about teaching and enthusiasm about the students) and rule 4 because profession and nationality are different concepts. \nThe answer: enthusiasm about the students", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to the teacher's enthusiasm about the subject matter they are teaching. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so it can be applied to the question to understand that the opposite of \"enthusiastic\" is \"unenthusiastic\". \nThe answer: enthusiastic", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well.\nThe answer: in the student", "{1, 3, 5, 7, 17}\nExplanation: An enthusiastic teacher can be very influential in a young student's life.\nThe answer: influential", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if a teacher enjoys teaching, then the students will get more out of the subject matter. Rule 3 applies because enjoying teaching, enjoying being around students, and enjoying the subject matter are different concepts.\nThe answer: teaching, being around students, and the subject matter", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the \"largest type\" of misconduct, which implies a comparison of different types. Rule 3 states that size and type are different concepts, so we cannot compare types based on their size. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms, so we can assume that \"largest\" means \"most significant\" or \"most prevalent.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important, so we need to look for the opposite of \"misconduct\" in the article. The article mentions \"sexual misconduct\" specifically, so we can infer that it is the largest type of misconduct being reviewed by the media. \nThe answer: Sexual misconduct.", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that 9.6% of students in the United States claim to have received unwanted sexual attention from an adult associated with education. \nThe answer: 9.6% of students", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country that the statistic is for, so we need to look for any mention of a country in the article. Rule 3 tells us that we need to differentiate between concepts, so we can't assume that the country is the United States just because the American Association of University Women conducted the study. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the article does not explicitly state which country the statistic is for. Therefore, we cannot provide a concise, minimal answer.", "{rule list: 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time period of the statistic, which is not explicitly stated in the article. However, the use of the past tense \"reported\" suggests that the statistic is not current. \nThe answer: The time period of the statistic is not specified in the article.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" tells us that the name of the organization that conducted the survey is important. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" tells us that the specific percentage reported in the survey is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: American Association of University Women", "{1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A is more prevalent than B, then B is less prevalent than A. Rule 2 applies because it clarifies that if a study shows a certain prevalence, then it is the most accurate and reliable information available. Rule 13 applies because it clarifies that location is important for the answer.\nThe answer: England", "{rule list: 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. In this context, the question is asking for the definition of \"professionals\" in the study. The passage mentions that the British study included priests, religious leaders, case workers, and teachers as professionals. However, it also notes that the questions referred to \"sexual abuse with a professional,\" not necessarily a teacher. Therefore, the definition of \"professionals\" in the study is not explicitly available and not necessarily reliable.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of people involved in the study, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the article provides information on what the study did include, but also what it did not include. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"The sample was drawn from a list of 80,000 schools to create a stratified two-stage sample design of 2,065 8th to 11th grade students\" is in the passive voice, but it still provides the answer to the question. \nThe answer: 2,065", "{4, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks about a specific study that covered subjects in 80,000 schools. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate the mention of priests and religious leaders as they are not relevant to the question. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"study\" or \"research\" in the passage. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about the British study. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we can focus on the mention of the AAUW study. \nThe answer: The AAUW study.", "{rule list: 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: These rules help us identify that the question is asking for a location where there have been well-known cases of teacher misconduct, and that the use of \"very well-known\" implies a positive answer. The negation in the question is also important to note. \nThe answer: United States", "{rule list: 4, 10}\nExplanation: The gender of the teachers mentioned is relevant to the answer, so rule 4 applies. Typos in the question are irrelevant, but contractions are, so rule 10 applies.\nThe answer: Increased scrutiny on teacher misconduct.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is related to the fear of being labeled a pedophile or hebephile, which is a negative association with the profession of teaching. This fear is likely due to the societal stigma surrounding male teachers and their interactions with children. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are relevant as they distinguish between concepts such as profession and age, and gender and profession. Rule 17 is also relevant as it highlights the importance of negations in the question, which is necessary to understand the reason behind men avoiding the teaching profession. \nThe answer: fear of being labeled a pedophile or hebephile", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify \"general secretary\" as the profession and \"National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers\" as the organization. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can identify \"Chris Keates\" as the general secretary. \nThe answer: Chris Keates", "{13, 18}\nExplanation: The statement made by Chris Keates caused issues with child protection and parental rights groups.\nThe answer: child protection and parental rights groups", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules of 3, 4, and 16 are relevant because they establish that profession and gender are different concepts, and that first comes before last. The answer is that the avoidance of men to become teachers has reportedly led to a shortage of male teachers in some areas.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Chris Keates believed that teachers who have sex with pupils over the age of consent should not be placed on the sex offenders register. This is a negation of being placed on the register, which is important to the answer.", "3, 4, 7, 17\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. Stress is a concept related to mental and physical health, which falls under rule 3. Negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for something that can hurt a teacher's health. \nThe answer: Occupational stress.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: When teachers have a large workload, it can contribute to occupational stress.", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: The profession of the subject is relevant to the answer, and gender is irrelevant to profession.\nThe answer: occupational burnout", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: A change in an organization can cause occupational stress for teachers, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health, productivity, and students' performance. (Applying rule 3, \"organizational change\" is a concept related to \"occupational stress,\" and applying rule 4, \"profession\" is a different concept from \"organization.\") \nThe answer: Occupational stress", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: If a teacher experiences occupational stress, it can negatively impact their mental and physical health, productivity, and students' performance. Therefore, if a teacher is experiencing occupational stress, it can result in a decrease in student performance.\nThe answer: occupational stress", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of teachers who experienced occupational stress in a specific study conducted in 2000. The answer can be found in the sentence \"A 2000 study found that 42% of UK teachers experienced occupational stress.\" This is a passive sentence, so we need to identify the subject (the study) and the object (the number of teachers who experienced occupational stress). The answer is 42%.\nThe answer: 42%", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location where the 2000 study was conducted, so we need to focus on rules that deal with locations and negations. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the location where the study was conducted, not where the teachers were located. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to look for any negations in the question. The answer is not explicitly stated in the article, so we can use process of elimination to determine that the study was not conducted in the UK, since the question states that the study found that 42% of UK teachers experienced occupational stress, implying that the study was conducted elsewhere. Therefore, the answer is: not in the UK.", "Rule 1: if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\nRule 2: if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\nExplanation: The question asks for a comparison between the stress levels of UK teachers and the average profession. Rule 1 applies because the article states that the 42% figure for occupational stress among UK teachers is twice the figure for the average profession. Therefore, the average profession has half the rate of occupational stress compared to UK teachers. Rule 2 also applies because the question asks for a comparison of how much higher the stress figure is for UK teachers compared to other jobs. The answer is that the stress figure for UK teachers is twice as high as the average profession. \nThe answer: Twice the figure for the average profession.", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The second relevant rule states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, the 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety, depression, and stress than average workers, so the answer is anxiety. The 17th relevant rule states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to specifically look for the study that showed double the rate, which is the 2012 study. \nThe answer: the 2012 study.", "{1, 4, 18}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison between teachers and another group. Rule 4 applies because profession is a different concept from nationality. Rule 18 applies because the question contains the word \"more\". \nThe answer: average workers", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions two types of interventions: organizational interventions and individual-level interventions. \nThe answer: two", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: \"Providing support networks\" is an organizational intervention aimed at reducing occupational stress among teachers. According to rule 3, \"providing support networks\" is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color, which means it cannot be classified under any of those categories. According to rule 4, profession and nationality are different concepts, which means \"providing support networks\" cannot be considered a profession. Therefore, the answer is: an organizational intervention.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"stress-management training\" as an individual-level intervention used to relieve occupational stress among teachers. The word \"relieve\" indicates that stress-management training is considered a way to reduce or alleviate stress. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and is not relevant to this question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer and is also not relevant to this question.\nThe answer: a way to relieve occupational stress among teachers", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Bonuses are a form of reward or incentive, which can help to reduce occupational stress among teachers by increasing job satisfaction and motivation. Rule 3 states that rewards and job satisfaction are different concepts, while rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, offering bonuses can help to reduce occupational stress among teachers by increasing job satisfaction and motivation, which in turn can lead to improved performance and reduced stress levels. \nThe answer: occupational stress among teachers", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Changing the work environment is a modification of the physical surroundings of the workplace, which falls under the concept of \"environment\" and is therefore a different concept from \"schedule,\" \"support networks,\" \"mentoring,\" \"promotions,\" and \"bonuses,\" which are organizational interventions. It is not an individual-level intervention like stress-management training and counseling.\nThe answer: Organizational intervention", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that \"in almost all countries teachers are educated in a university or college.\" Rule 4 applies because the question asks for the location where teachers are taught, which is a different concept than their nationality or profession. \nThe answer: in a university or college", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The rules state that governments may require certification by a recognized body before teachers can teach in a school. Therefore, the answer is certification. \nThe answer: certification", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in many countries, an elementary school education certificate is earned after completion of high school. Rule 3 states that age and education level are different concepts, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, the answer is an elementary school education certificate. \nThe answer: elementary school education certificate", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that in addition to certification, many educational institutions require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation. This means that passing a background check and psychiatric evaluation might also be required of a teacher to pass, in addition to certification.\nThe answer: background check and psychiatric evaluation", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In addition to certification, many educational institutions especially within the US, require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation to be able to teach in classroom.\" This means that the requirement for a background check applies specifically to the United States.\nThe answer: United States", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being \"the Australian government.\" The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" means that we can't just say \"the states and territories.\" Therefore, the answer is \"the individual states and territories.\" \nThe answer: the individual states and territories", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that the different levels of education (primary, secondary, tertiary) are distinct concepts. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that the different levels of education are not related to a person's profession or nationality. \nThe answer: three", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and so are profession and nationality. Secondary education is a type of education, while tertiary education is another type of education. \nThe answer: Tertiary education", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Tertiary education refers to education at the university and/or TAFE college level. This falls under the third tier of education in Australia's three-tier model, following primary and secondary education.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Australian education system follows a three-tier model, with primary education being the first tier. \nThe answer: Primary education", "{1, 4, 19}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Therefore, the minimum requirement to teach in Canada is a post-secondary degree Bachelor's Degree.\nThe answer: a post-secondary degree Bachelor's Degree", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it clarifies that the second Bachelor's Degree mentioned in the passage is a different degree from the post-secondary degree mentioned earlier. Therefore, the answer is: a second Bachelor's Degree such as a Bachelor of Education.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts and the rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts both indicate that the concept of \"private school\" is different from the concept of \"funding source.\" Therefore, the answer is: \"funded by the private sector, businesses and sponsors.\"", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: In Germany, teachers are considered civil servants. This is because they are recruited through special university classes and their salaries depend on the civil servants' salary index scale. Therefore, rule 3 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and rule 4 (civil servant is a profession) apply.\nThe answer: Civil servants", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: Teachers in Germany are mainly civil servants recruited from special university classes called Lehramtstudien.\nThe answer: special university classes", "{rule list: size and category are different concepts, profession and nationality are different concepts}\nExplanation: Elementary Schools are a type of school, which falls under the category of schools for younger students. Therefore, the answer is not a profession or a nationality. \nThe answer: Grundschule", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that salaries for teachers depend on the civil servants' salary index scale, which is a system used to determine the salaries of civil servants. Therefore, rule 3 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) are relevant. \nThe answer: civil servants' salary index scale", "{rule list: profession and level are different concepts, names are equally important}\nExplanation: Upper-level secondary schools are called Gymnasium.\nThe answer: Gymnasium", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: Teaching on an island results in extra pay for primary teachers in Ireland.\nThe answer: extra pay", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the basic pay for a starting teacher, which is less than the pay for a teacher with 25 years of service. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific aspect of the teacher's job (pay) and not their size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animal, or vehicle. \nThe answer: \u20ac27,814", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the salary increases incrementally with seniority. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking about a specific amount of money. \nThe answer: \u20ac53,423", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"A principal of a large school with many years experience and several qualifications (M.A., H.Dip., etc.) could earn over \u20ac90,000.\" This means that a principal of a big school can make over \u20ac90,000.\nThe answer: over \u20ac90,000", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is also not relevant. The most relevant rules are that if A is required to have X to do Y, then not having X means not being able to do Y (rule 1), and that professions are important for the answer (rule 4). \nThe answer: The Teaching Council.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the section of the Teaching Council Act that pertains to registration. This is indicated by the use of the word \"under\" in the passage. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for the section that requires registration, not the section that prohibits payment. Rule 23 reminds us that passive voice is used in the passage, so we need to look for the section that is being referred to, not the subject that is doing the referring. \nThe answer: Section 30", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the date mentioned in the passage (2001) is the year when the Teaching Council Act was passed. Rule 23 establishes that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is the case in \"the Teaching Council Act 2001 was passed\". \nThe answer: 2001", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts applies here, as well as the rule that irrelevant information should be ignored. The answer is \"Oireachtas funds.\" \nThe answer: Oireachtas funds.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The rule \"if A had profession X but changed to profession Y, then A has profession Y\" is not relevant to this question. The relevant rule is \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which establishes that the information about the introduction of vetting comes at the beginning of the passage. \nThe answer: 2006", "{1, 4, 19}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Therefore, the answer is \"new entrants to the teaching profession\" and \"existing staff\" are subject to vetting.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Garda vetting procedures apply to both teaching and non-teaching posts, and that existing staff will be vetted on a phased basis.\nThe answer: on a phased basis", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes the relationship between those who refuse vetting and their ability to be appointed or engaged by the school. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of profession and employment. Rule 17 applies because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: those who refuse vetting", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that salaries for Nursery, Primary and Secondary School teachers ranged from \u00a320,133 to \u00a341,004 in September 2007. The high end of the salary range in 2007 was \u00a341,004. \nThe answer: \u00a341,004", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Salaries can go higher than the range depending on experience and extra responsibilities.\nThe answer: experience and extra responsibilities", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that Preschool teachers may earn \u00a320,980 annually.\nThe answer: \u00a320,980 annually.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that the type of degree a teacher must have is not related to their nationality. The rule that education is a different concept from profession tells us that the type of degree a teacher must have is related to their profession. Therefore, the answer is: a bachelor's degree.", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the salary range was valid in September 2007.\nThe answer: September 2007", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that \"counties offer alternative licensing programs to attract people into teaching.\" This indicates that counties offer alternative ways to become licensed as a teacher in order to attract more people to the profession. \nThe answer: alternative licensing programs", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: These rules state that profession and subject are different concepts, and that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The question asks about \"positions\" that counties are trying to recruit for, which can be interpreted as \"teaching positions\" or \"teacher positions\". Therefore, the answer is: hard-to-fill teaching positions.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" (8) are relevant here. The question asks whether opportunities would be the same in each subject or vary, implying that there may be differences based on the subject taught. Therefore, the answer is that opportunities would vary by subject taught.", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the type of opportunities that would be expected from the counties. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be related to a specific profession. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if retirements outweigh slowing enrollment growth, then the expected opportunities would be more than the slowing enrollment growth. \nThe answer: Excellent job opportunities", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that retirements are especially high among secondary school teachers, which implies that they are retiring more than teachers in other levels. This is supported by the fact that the article mentions \"especially\" and \"outweigh slowing enrollment growth.\" \nThe answer: secondary school teachers", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" helps us identify that the question is asking about a profession, which is teaching. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the answer is the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS). \nThe answer: the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS)", "{3, 4, 19}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the profession is not relevant to the answer. The rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Therefore, the answer is: teaching.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that there are seven Scottish universities that offer Initial Teacher Education (ITE) courses. \nThe answer: seven", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article explains that graduates wishing to teach in Scotland must complete a program of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) at one of the seven Scottish Universities. Once successfully completed, they are given \"Provisional Registration\" by the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS), which is raised to \"Full Registration\" status after a year if the \"Standard for Full Registration\" has been met. Therefore, completing the ITE program results in Provisional Registration. \nThe answer: Provisional Registration", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Provisional Registration is upgraded to Full Registration after a year if the requirements are met.\nThe answer: one year", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the specific information in the passage about the start of the salary year. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the absence of negations indicates that the answer is an affirmative statement. Rule 22 is also relevant because it clarifies that \"beginning\" refers to the first part of the year. \nThe answer: April 2008", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, if a teacher earns up to \u00a332,583 after 6 years of teaching, a Probationer would earn less than that. \nThe answer: \u00a320,427.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that salary is a different concept from other details mentioned in the passage. We use rule 8 to infer that if a teacher earns more after 6 years of service, then a Probationer earns less than \u00a332,583. \nThe answer: \u00a320,427", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because earning more money after 6 years means that the salary is increasing, and therefore, the initial salary is less than the salary after 6 years. Rule 2 applies because the initial salary is given as a specific amount, while the salary after 6 years is given as a range. Therefore, the initial salary is the least amount a teacher can earn after 6 years, and the highest amount a teacher can earn after 6 years is \u00a332,583. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking about what a teacher needs to do to earn more money, which is related to their profession. \nThe answer: Complete the modules to earn Chartered Teacher Status.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: Profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4), and names are equally important for the answer (rule 13).\nThe answer: Teachers in Scotland can register with trade unions, including the Educational Institute of Scotland and the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Education in Wales differs from education elsewhere in the United Kingdom in that a significant number of students are educated through the medium of Welsh and Welsh medium education is available to all age groups. This is due to the fact that Wales has a strong Welsh-speaking population and a history of Welsh language education. \nThe answer: medium of instruction", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that a significant number of students in Wales are educated through the medium of Welsh, and that Welsh medium education is available to all age groups. Therefore, the language used to educate in Wales is Welsh.\nThe answer: Welsh", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from others is not relevant to this question. The first rule is not relevant because there is no comparison between entities. The answer to the question is found in the last sentence, which states that \"lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16.\" This means that students are required to learn Welsh until they are 16 years old.\nThe answer: Until the age of 16.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for the percentage of primary schools that used Welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction, implying that there are some schools that use Welsh as a secondary medium. Therefore, the answer is \"22 per cent\".", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Welsh medium education is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in adult education.\nThe answer: all age groups", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: Teachers in Wales can be registered members of trade unions such as ATL, NUT or NASUWT.\nThe answer: trade unions", "{2, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the average age of teachers in Wales is falling with teachers being younger than in previous years.\" This means that the average age of teachers in Wales is decreasing.\nThe answer: The average age of teachers in Wales is falling.", "{1, 2, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the time period when attacks on teachers were the highest. Rule 1 helps us understand that \"highest\" means \"most\" and we need to look for the time period when attacks were the most frequent. Rule 2 helps us understand that \"growing cause of concern\" means that the frequency of attacks is increasing. Rule 16 helps us understand that we need to identify the time period when attacks were at their peak. Rule 17 helps us understand that \"all-time high\" means the highest point in history. \nThe answer: between 2005 and 2010.", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: NASUWT is a trade union for teachers in Wales.\nThe answer: a trade union for teachers in Wales", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that negations are important for the answer is relevant because the question asks about the negative impact of the attacks. The rule that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer is not relevant because the question does not contain any typos. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the question. The answer: growing cause of concern.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"each state determines the requirements for getting a license to teach in public schools.\" This means that the requirements for teachers are decided by the state. \nThe answer: each state", "{2, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" applies because the article states that teaching certification generally lasts three years, but teachers can receive certificates that last as long as ten years. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies because the question asks about the longest time, which implies a comparison to shorter times. \nThe answer: 10 years", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that public school teachers are required to have a bachelor's degree and the majority must be certified by the state in which they teach. This satisfies both rule 3 (education level) and rule 4 (profession). \nThe answer: a bachelor's degree and state certification.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: Charter schools may not require that their teachers be certified.\nThe answer: Charter schools", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: Charter schools may not require their teachers to be certified, but they must meet the standards to be highly qualified as set by No Child Left Behind. \nThe answer: the standards to be highly qualified as set by No Child Left Behind", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: In the past, teachers were paid relatively low salaries compared to now. \"Relatively low\" implies that salaries were less than what they are now, which means that teachers were paid less in the past than they are now.\nThe answer: relatively low salaries", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years.\" This indicates that salaries have been increasing. Rule 2 applies because \"improved rapidly\" implies that salaries have gone from being somewhat low to being least low or even most high. Rule 8 applies because \"getting much better\" is a synonym for \"improved rapidly.\" \nThe answer: average teacher salaries", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. This applies to teachers with more experience and higher education earning more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that factors such as state and relative cost of living can affect a teacher's salary. \nThe answer: more experience and higher education", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259.\" \nThe answer: elementary school teachers", "{7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific website where teachers sell their lesson plans. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means that \"website\" can be replaced with \"web platform\" or \"online platform\". Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, which means that the specific name of the website should be mentioned in the article. The answer: TeachersPayTeachers.com.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules of size, shape, age, and color and animals and vehicles are not relevant to the question. The rule of profession and nationality is not relevant as the question is about types of religious or spiritual teachers, which are not professions or nationalities. The answer does not require knowledge of gender or names. The rule of first and last is not relevant. The answer does not require knowledge of active or passive sentences. The answer does not require knowledge of negations or contractions. The answer does not require knowledge of synonyms or typos. The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 4 (different concepts), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). \nThe answer: There are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in Christianity, across all three major traditions - (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational.", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule that profession and nationality are different concepts are not relevant to this question. The rule that negations are important for the answer is also not relevant. However, the rule that emphasizes the importance of synonyms and antonyms in the question is relevant, as is the rule that emphasizes the importance of negations in the context. The answer is: Protestant.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so being a confessor does not necessarily mean being a bishop. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so since the Pope is mentioned first and the confessor is mentioned later, it can be inferred that the confessor is not a bishop. \nThe answer: No", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions three major traditions in Christianity: (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational. \nThe answer: (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The abbreviation for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not explicitly stated in the article, but it is a common knowledge that the abbreviation is LDS Church. Rule 3 states that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the abbreviation is not explicitly stated does not affect the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that the abbreviation is commonly known is sufficient to provide a concise answer. \nThe answer: LDS Church", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage mentions that the role of spiritual teacher may be filled by individuals who hold any office or no office at all. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about the concept of a spiritual teacher, which is different from the concept of an office in the Aaronic priesthood. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about who may be a spiritual teacher, and the use of \"may\" implies a negation. \nThe answer: Many individuals, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and negations are important for the answer. The passage mentions that the emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more \"low-church\" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family. Therefore, the answer is not a specific type of mentorship, but rather spiritual mentorship in general. \nThe answer: spiritual mentorship", "{1, 4, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rules state that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, and that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. Therefore, we can infer that the answer refers to a person, and not a specific gender. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is also relevant, as the question asks about spiritual mentorship, which is not tied to a specific nationality. Finally, the rule that \"his\" refers to male names and \"her\" refers to female names is also relevant, as the question asks about who is expected to lead the family in spiritual mentorship. \nThe answer: The husband and father of a family.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The rule that \"additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders\" is relevant because it establishes the hierarchy of spiritual authority within the LDS Church. The rule that \"Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home\" is also relevant because it establishes the importance of the father's spiritual authority within the family. \nThe answer: the father of the house", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Therefore, we need to focus on the specific term used in the passage. \nThe answer: guru", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"high\" and \"low\" are comparative terms. Rule 2 applies because \"extremely high\" implies that the focus is at the highest level. Rule 17 applies because the question is asking for a negation, and the answer is the opposite of \"low.\" \nThe answer: high", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about who gurus control, which implies that there is a belief that gurus do control someone. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the passage. The passage states that gurus often exercise a great deal of control over the lives of their disciples, so the answer is disciples.\nThe answer: disciples", "{2, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking about an area where spiritual mentorship is highly emphasized. Rule 2 applies because \"extremely high\" is a stronger version of \"very high,\" so the answer should use the superlative form. Rule 4 applies because the question is asking about an area, which is a different concept from profession or nationality. \nThe answer: In many traditions of Hinduism.", "{1, 4, 13, 19}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, names are equally important for the answer, and a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Therefore, the answer is \"Lama\".", "{rule list: 19, 23}\nExplanation: A Lama who has consciously determined to be reborn in order to continue their Bodhisattva vow.\nThe answer: be reborn", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a Bodhisattva vow, which is mentioned in the context as being continued by a Lama who has consciously determined to be reborn. Rule 3 states that concepts such as names are important for the answer, and rule 7 states that synonyms from words in the context paragraph may be used in the question. Therefore, the answer is Bodhisattva vow. \nThe answer: Bodhisattva vow", "{rule list: 19, 23}\nExplanation: A Lama who has consciously determined to be reborn is called a Tulku.\nThe answer: It is not specified.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Lama \"has through phowa and siddhi consciously determined to be reborn.\" This implies that the Lama made a conscious decision to be reborn, likely through the practice of phowa and siddhi. The use of \"consciously\" and \"determined\" suggest a deliberate and intentional choice. The rules used are 1 (to understand the relationship between phowa and siddhi and the Lama's decision to be reborn), 2 (to understand the degree of consciousness and intentionality involved in the decision), 3 (to differentiate between the concepts of phowa, siddhi, and rebirth), 4 (to differentiate between the concepts of profession and religion), 7 (to consider synonyms and related concepts), 8 (to understand the importance of negations), 12 (to ignore irrelevant information), and 17 (to consider the importance of negations in the question). \nThe answer: phowa and siddhi", "{4, 17, 19}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any confusion between who teaches and where they are from. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"proper\" in the question. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can eliminate any confusion between male and female teachers. \nThe answer: ulemas", "{4, 23}\nExplanation: Profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4), so the article's mention of ulemas being able to render legal verdicts upon matters of Islamic law indicates that those with the profession of ulama have the authority to decide on legal matters in Islam. Additionally, the use of the passive voice in \"can render legal verdicts\" indicates that the subject (ulemas) is being acted upon the verb (render), which is a characteristic of passive sentences (rule 23).\nThe answer: ulemas", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a specific type of Islam, which is the mystical or spiritual type. This is mentioned in the passage as Sufism. The other rules are not relevant to this question.\nThe answer: Sufism", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: \"exoteric\" is a concept that is being compared to \"esoteric\" in the passage, and the passage explains that exoteric refers to actions-oriented, such as the Five Pillars of Islam. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to this question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: actions-oriented", "{3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the concept of spiritual teachers in Sufism and mentions that the highest living saint is called a Qutb.\nThe answer: Qutb", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: Martin Luther's nationality is a different concept from his profession or any other characteristic mentioned in the article. Gender is also not relevant to his nationality.\nThe answer: German", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the first date mentioned is November 10, 1483, which is Luther's birthdate, and the last date mentioned is February 18, 1546, which is his death date. Therefore, the answer is February 18, 1546.\nThe answer: February 18, 1546.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Luther rejected teachings and practices of the Late Medieval Catholic Church.\nThe answer: Late Medieval Catholic Church", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The Church claimed that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money.\nThe answer: God's punishment for sin.", "{16, 17}\nExplanation: In this sentence, Luther's refusal to retract his writings resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor. This is a clear example of a negative consequence resulting from Luther's actions. Therefore, rules 16 and 17 are the most relevant, as they state that negations are important for the answer. Additionally, the question contains the word \"refused,\" which is a negation. \nThe answer: Luther was excommunicated by the Pope and condemned as an outlaw by the Emperor.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the opposite of \"earned by good deeds,\" which is \"received as a free gift of God's grace.\" Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the concept of how salvation is achieved, which is different from the concepts of size, shape, age, and color.\nThe answer: through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Martin Luther believed that God's grace was achieved through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin, not through good deeds.\nThe answer: faith in Jesus Christ", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Pope", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question asks for what Luther thought was the only source of knowledge of God, which is the Bible. The answer is found in the sentence \"His theology challenged the authority and office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge from God.\"", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Luther considered all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood, which falls under the concept of religion. This is supported by rule 3, which states that religion and profession are different concepts. \nThe answer: a holy priesthood", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Martin Luther translated the Bible into the vernacular, which made it more accessible and had a tremendous impact on the church and German culture. This is an example of rule 1 because translating the Bible into the vernacular made it more accessible, and therefore Latin (the previous language of the Bible) was less accessible. This is an example of rule 3 because language is a different concept than the Bible. \nThe answer: the Bible", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"language\" is a different concept from \"religion\" (rule 3) is relevant because it helps us focus on the impact of Luther's translation on the German language. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" (rule 8) is also relevant because Luther's translation made the Bible more accessible in the vernacular (German), which means that before his translation, the Bible was less accessible in the German language. \nThe answer: Luther's translation of the Bible promoted the development of a standard version of the German language.", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Luther's translation of the Bible into the vernacular influenced the writing of an English translation, the Tyndale Bible.\nThe answer: Tyndale Bible", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Luther's hymns influenced the development of singing in churches.\nThe answer: singing in churches", "{4, 19}\nExplanation: Martin Luther's marriage allowed Protestant clergy to marry, breaking with the Catholic Church's tradition of celibacy for clergy.\nThe answer: Protestant clergy to marry.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Martin Luther was born before any other event mentioned in the article. Rule 22 establishes that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed and \"latter\" to the last, but there are no entities listed in this article. Therefore, we can simply output the answer as: November 10, 1483. \nThe answer: November 10, 1483.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the location where Martin Luther was born in the passage.\nThe answer: Eisleben, Saxony", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Saxony is a location, and therefore rule 3 applies. The article provides information about Martin Luther's birthplace, which was in Saxony, and therefore rule 13 applies. \nThe answer: Holy Roman Empire", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Martin Luther was baptized as a Catholic. \nThe answer: Catholic", "{4, 16, 19}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any mention of Martin's nationality or ethnicity is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Hans Luder is Martin's father. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can determine that Martin's father wanted him to become a lawyer.\nThe answer: lawyer", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Martin Luther entered the University of Erfurt at the age of 19 and received his master's degree in 1505.\nThe answer: University of Erfurt", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Luther's description of the University of Erfurt falls under the concept of quality, specifically his opinion of the university's atmosphere. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, Luther's description implies a negative opinion of the university, so the answer should reflect this negative sentiment.\nThe answer: Luther described the University of Erfurt as a \"beerhouse and whorehouse.\"", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the sentence mentions Luther entering the University of Erfurt at the age of 19 and then goes on to describe his daily routine, which includes waking up at four every morning. Therefore, we can conclude that Luther had to awaken at four every morning at the age of 19 when he entered the University of Erfurt.\nThe answer: at the age of 19", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Luther described his learning at the University of Erfurt as \"a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises.\"\nThe answer: as \"a day of rote learning and often wearying spiritual exercises\"", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year in which Luther received his degree, which is a specific point in time. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the year in which he received his degree comes after the year in which he entered the university. Rule 23 tells us that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb.\" The sentence \"He received his master's degree in 1505\" is in the active voice, so we know that Luther received his degree in 1505. \nThe answer: 1505.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Luther enrolled in law school but dropped out almost immediately.\nThe answer: law school", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: uncertainty", "{1, 3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Martin Luther dropped out of law school and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. However, he found philosophy unsatisfying as it did not offer assurance about loving God, which was more important to him. He believed that reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God, and that human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, making Scripture increasingly important to him. Therefore, Martin Luther preferred theology and Scripture. \nThe answer: Theology and Scripture", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 and 17. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not applicable here. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. In the passage, Luther's tutors taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Therefore, the answer is that Luther's tutors advised him to test everything himself by experience.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Luther believed that reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Therefore, reason could not be used to test one's relationship with God. \nThe answer: one's relationship with God", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Martin Luther was terrified of death and divine judgment after a lightning bolt struck near him.\nThe answer: death and divine judgment", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2 July 1505", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther \"entered a closed Augustinian cloister in Erfurt on 17 July 1505.\" This is a passive sentence, where \"Luther\" is the subject being acted upon by the verb \"entered.\" Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so \"Erfurt\" comes after \"closed Augustinian cloister.\" Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, \"the subject is acted upon the verb,\" so \"Luther\" is the subject being acted upon by the verb \"entered.\" \nThe answer: Erfurt (closed Augustinian cloister)", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The deaths of two friends.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Martin's father viewed his entering the cloister as a waste of Luther's education.\nThe answer: Luther's education", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Luther's devotion to the Augustinian order implies that he prioritized it over other things. Rule 3 applies because Luther's devotion is not related to size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: the Augustinian order", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Luther felt that he made Christ the jailer and hangman of his poor soul.\nThe answer: jailer and hangman", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between Luther and Johann von Staupitz. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between Luther's profession as a member of the Augustinian order and his nationality. Rule 16 applies because it establishes a temporal relationship between Luther's spiritual despair and his interaction with Johann von Staupitz. \nThe answer: Johann von Staupitz", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. In this case, the question asks for the lesson that Johann von Staupitz taught Luther about repentance, so the answer should focus on the concept of repentance. The passage states that von Staupitz taught Luther that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart, so the answer is that von Staupitz taught Luther that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Martin Luther was ordained to the priesthood in 1507.\nThe answer: 1507", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the name of the person who asked Luther to teach theology is not relevant. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"von Staupitz\" is the last name and \"Luther\" is the first name.\nThe answer: von Staupitz", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: We need to determine when Luther was called by von Staupitz to Wittenberg. Rule 1 tells us that if A is called before B, then B was called after A. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Therefore, we can infer that Luther was called by von Staupitz to Wittenberg before he was ordained to the priesthood in 1507. The exact year is given in the text as 1508. \nThe answer: 1508", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther received a bachelor's degree in Biblical studies on March 9, 1508.\nThe answer: March 9, 1508", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Sentences by Peter Lombard", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage states that Martin Luther was awarded his Doctor of Theology on October 19, 1512, and then on October 21, 1512, he was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg. Therefore, the answer is October 19, 1512. \nThe answer: October 19, 1512.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"On 21 October 1512, [Luther] was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg\" directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 21 October 1512", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify Luther's position at the University of Wittenberg. Rule 1 tells us that if A is called to position X, then A holds position X. Rule 16 tells us that \"position\" refers to a job or role. Rule 23 tells us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, the answer is: Doctor in Bible.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" The passage states that Luther was \"received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg\" on 21 October 1512 and \"spent the rest of his career in this position at the University of Wittenberg.\" Therefore, Luther spent his career at the University of Wittenberg.\nThe answer: University of Wittenberg", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the first date mentioned is 19 October 1512, and the degree that Martin Luther received on that date is mentioned in the same sentence. Therefore, the answer is: Doctor of Theology.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1516", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: To sell indulgences to raise money to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the theology that states that faith alone is not enough for justification. Rule 3 states that concepts such as theology are different from concepts such as size or shape. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: Roman Catholic theology.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\", meaning that the answer cannot be any of those concepts. The rule that applies to the negation in the question is \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\", meaning that \"faith alone\" is not enough for man's justification. Therefore, the answer is \"such faith as is active in charity and good works\".", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the definition of a Catholic doctrine, which implies that there may be other doctrines that are not fides caritate formata. The answer is that fides caritate formata is the Catholic doctrine that justification depends on faith that is active in charity and good works.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Martin Luther protested the sale of indulgences to his bishop on October 31, 1517.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Luther wrote to his bishop, Albert of Mainz\nThe answer: Albert of Mainz", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of Luther's document, which is mentioned in the passage as \"his 'Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences', which came to be known as The Ninety-Five Theses.\" Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for the later name of the document. \nThe answer: The Ninety-Five Theses", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's intention is being negated in the question, so rule 17 applies. The question is asking for a person's opinion, which falls under the category of profession, so rule 4 applies. \nThe answer: Hans Hillerbrand", "{7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 7 and 8 are relevant because the question asks for a specific thesis that questions the Pope's actions, and the answer must be a direct quote from the text. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"not with his own money\"), which is important for understanding which thesis is being referred to.\nThe answer: Thesis 86", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that 'As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory (also attested as 'into heaven') springs.'\" The use of the word \"objection\" indicates a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Johann Tetzel", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that \"As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory (also attested as 'into heaven') springs.\" This means that Tetzel stated that the soul could leave purgatory either by going into heaven or by simply being released from purgatory. \nThe answer: The soul could leave purgatory either by going into heaven or by being released from purgatory.", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"objected to\" is the opposite of \"supported\". Rule 8 applies because \"objected to\" is a comparison between Luther and Tetzel. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"who objected to not\". \nThe answer: Luther", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the person who said that the soul would spring from purgatory through monetary donations. The sentence in the article is in the form of a reported speech, so it is in the passive voice. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, the person who said the quote is not the subject of the sentence. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negation of the quote. The article states that Luther objected to the saying, so the answer is that the quote was attributed to Johann Tetzel, but Luther objected to it. \nThe answer: Johann Tetzel", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Martin Luther insisted that forgiveness was God's alone to grant, which means that no one else can grant forgiveness. Additionally, the use of the word \"error\" implies that there were people who claimed otherwise. \nThe answer: God", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error. This means that indulgences were not supposed to grant the giver salvation or absolution from all punishments.\nThe answer: Indulgence were not supposed to grant the giver salvation or absolution from all punishments.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the act of giving money to the church and the concept of absolution. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of giving money and absolution. Rule 8 applies because it establishes that giving money to the church does not absolve the giver from anything. \nThe answer: Giving money to the church did not absolve the giver from anything.", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for what Luther called \"these donations,\" which implies that the donations have been previously mentioned in the article. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negative term that describes the donations. Rule 18 reminds us that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the wording of the question. The answer: Luther called these donations \"false assurances.\"", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Luther believed that Christians must not slacken in following Christ on account of false assurances that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation. This statement implies that Luther believed that such claims were in error and that forgiveness was God's alone to grant.\nThe answer: Christ", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes the relationship between Tetzel's saying and contemporary Catholic teaching on indulgences. Rule 7 is relevant because the question contains a synonym for \"indulgences\" (\"freeing souls from purgatory\"). Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"by no means representative\"), which indicates that the answer is not Tetzel. \nThe answer: Tetzel", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The statement of Tetzel showed that he had the capacity to exaggerate.\nThe answer: He had the capacity to exaggerate.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tetzel \"overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead,\" indicating that he exaggerated the effectiveness of indulgences for deceased individuals. Therefore, the answer is \"in regard to indulgences for the dead.\" \nThe answer: for indulgences for the dead", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Tetzel's teachings on indulgences for the living were in line with Catholic dogma of the time.\nThe answer: indulgences for the living were in line with Catholic dogma of the time.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"posting on the door\" can be replaced by \"95 theses\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer is \"the story of the posting on the door\". \nThe answer: The story of the posting on the door.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be related to any of these concepts. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we need to identify the main idea of the paragraph. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negation in the passage. The answer is the story of the posting on the door. \nThe answer: The story of the posting on the door.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the story of the posting on the door is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon.\nThe answer: Philipp Melanchthon", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Melanchthon's location at the time is negated in the passage, indicating that it is important for the answer. Names are also important for the answer.\nThe answer: It is not known where Melanchthon was at the time.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The scholars agree that the story of the posting on the door has little foundation in truth. \nThe answer: little foundation in truth", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther's friends translated the 95 Theses into German in January 1518 and that copies had spread throughout Germany within two weeks and throughout Europe within two months.\nThe answer: January 1518", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a device that aided a controversy. The passage mentions that the controversy was aided by the printing press, which is a device used for printing and copying texts. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the printing press is a physical device is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"device\" can be considered a synonym for \"printing press.\" \nThe answer: printing press", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and first comes before last and last comes after first (rule 16).\nThe answer: Luther's friends (or \"friends of Luther\")", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany.\nThe answer: two weeks", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"two weeks\" is less time than \"two months.\" Rule 7 applies because \"spread\" is a synonym for \"copied and disseminated.\" \nThe answer: two months", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Luther's writings circulated widely, reaching France, England, and Italy as early as 1519.\nThe answer: 1519", "{rule list: 1, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Students are the only group mentioned in the passage that would go to hear someone speak.\nThe answer: Students", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Luther's early career, specifically the time period in which he published a short commentary on Galatians and his Work on the Psalms and three of his best-known works in 1520, was one of his most creative and productive. This information is given in the passage. \nThe answer: Luther's early career", "{3, 7, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify when some of Luther's best-known works were published. Rule 3 tells us that age is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 tells us that we can use synonyms from the context paragraph. Rule 16 tells us that we need to identify the chronological order of events. The answer: 1520.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther published three of his best-known works in 1520: To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church, and On the Freedom of a Christian. Therefore, the answer is that Luther produced On the Freedom of a Christian in 1520. \nThe answer: On the Freedom of a Christian", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther lectured on the Psalms, the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians.", "{rule list: 2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Luther came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways, and he became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity. The answer is penance and righteousness.", "{rule list: 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Luther came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways and became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity. The answer is that Luther decided that the Catholic Church was corrupt.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther believed the Catholic Church had lost sight of several central truths of Christianity, but the question specifically asks for what Luther believed the Church had lost sight of. Rule 3 applies because size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 applies because the question contains the word \"lost sight of,\" which is an antonym of \"came to view in new ways\" used in the passage. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the word \"not,\" indicating a negation. \nThe answer: Luther believed the Church had lost sight of several central truths of Christianity.", "{rule list: 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the central article of the Christian doctrine, which is a concept. Rule 2 applies because the passage describes the importance of this concept to Luther and how it influenced his teachings. Rule 3 applies because the passage mentions other concepts related to Christianity that are not the central article. Rule 8 applies because the passage describes Luther's view that the Catholic Church had lost sight of this central article. \nThe answer: justification", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rules selected ensure that we correctly identify the subject of the sentence and avoid any confusion due to gender or profession. The answer is \"God\". \nThe answer: God", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the first publication mentioned in the article is On the Bondage of the Will. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that the sentence \"On the Bondage of the Will was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus\" is in the passive voice, and the subject is \"On the Bondage of the Will\". \nThe answer: 1525.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a gift from God", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in the Smalcald Articles", "{3, 5, 9, 19}\nExplanation: Luther believed that the just person lives by faith. \nThe answer: faith", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The answer must be related to Luther's rediscovery of \"Christ and His salvation\", which is the first point of the Reformation. Rule 1 applies because \"first\" implies a comparison with a second point. Rule 3 applies because \"first point\" refers to a concept. \nThe answer: Luther's rediscovery of \"Christ and His salvation\"", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"first of two points\" implies that there is a second point that is also part of the foundation. Rule 3 applies because \"Christ and His salvation\" and \"the sale of indulgences\" are different concepts. \nThe answer: Luther's rediscovery of \"Christ and His salvation\"", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"first of two points\" implies a comparison between two things. Rule 3 applies because \"Christ and His salvation\" are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what fueled Luther's concept, implying a negation. \nThe answer: Luther's rediscovery of \"Christ and His salvation\"", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are two points that became the foundation for the Reformation. The use of \"first\" implies that there is a second point. The word \"railing\" in the second sentence indicates that Luther was strongly opposed to the sale of indulgences, which suggests that this was the second point. \nThe answer: 2", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the recipient of Luther's letter containing the 95 Theses, which is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we need to apply rules 16 and 23 to identify that the subject is Luther and that the sentence is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: It is not specified in the given passage who received Luther's letter containing the 95 Theses.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Archbishop Albrecht forwarded the Theses to Rome after checking them for heresy, indicating that he did not agree with them. Therefore, we need to consider rules 1 and 2 to understand that he was less likely to agree with the Theses. Additionally, rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the antonym of \"agree\" is \"disagree\", so we can infer that Archbishop Albrecht disagreed with the Theses. Finally, rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to take into account the negation in the question. Therefore, the answer is: Rome.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Albrecht needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric. (rule 4: profession and nationality are different concepts, rule 17: negations are important for the answer) \nThe answer: a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: one half", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: Archbishop Albrecht sent Luther's letter containing the 95 Theses to Rome in December 1517.\nThe answer: December 1517", "{1, 4, 7, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21}\nExplanation: We need to identify the Pope who tried to undermine Luther's theories. We can infer from the passage that Pope Leo X responded slowly to Luther's ideas and deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against him. Therefore, we can conclude that Pope Leo X sought to undermine Luther's theories.\nThe answer: Pope Leo X", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Pope Leo X responded to Luther's reform movement with a series of papal theologians and envoys, which only served to harden Luther's anti-papal theology. The passage does not indicate that Pope Leo X launched anything specific against Luther. \nThe answer: Nothing specific, or no action was launched against Luther.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: October 1518", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The papal legate's orders were to arrest Luther if he failed to recant. This is stated in the passage: \"Cajetan's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant.\" The sentence is in the passive voice, with \"Cajetan's original instructions\" as the subject and \"to arrest Luther\" as the action. Rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) helps identify that \"Cajetan\" is the papal legate mentioned earlier in the passage. Rule 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb) helps understand the structure of the sentence. \nThe answer: To arrest Luther if he failed to recant.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in January 1519, Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach and Luther made certain concessions to him. Therefore, the answer is January 1519.\nThe answer: January 1519.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: remain silent if his opponents did", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Johann Eck", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the scripture that Luther used to support his opinion that churchmen were not infallible. This information is directly stated in the passage, and no additional rules are needed to extract the answer.\nThe answer: Matthew 16:18", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Johann Eck referred to Luther as a new Jan Hus, which means he considered Luther to be a heretic. This is an example of a comparison where A (Luther) is more antonym(orthodox) than B (Jan Hus), according to rule 8. \nThe answer: a new Jan Hus", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"On 15 June 1520, the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull (edict) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings, including the 95 Theses, within 60 days.\" This is a clear statement of when the Pope warned Luther. Rule 16 helps us identify that the question is asking for a specific time, and rule 23 helps us understand that the sentence is in the active voice, with the Pope as the subject warning Luther. \nThe answer: 15 June 1520", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Luther risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings within 60 days.\nThe answer: recant 41 sentences drawn from his writings", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 60 days", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The passage only mentions the name of the person, not their profession or nationality. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is also not relevant, as there is only one person mentioned in the passage. However, the rule that names are equally important for the answer, as well as the rules that shape the order of events (rule 3) and the use of titles (rule 4) are relevant. The passage mentions that Karl von Miltitz, a papal nuncio, attempted to broker a solution. Therefore, the answer is Karl von Miltitz. \n\nThe answer: Karl von Miltitz", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the date when Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo X, which is given in the passage as \"3 January 1521.\"\nThe answer: 3 January 1521", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the enforcement of the ban on the 95 Theses fell to the secular authorities. This means that it was not a religious authority that enforced the ban. Additionally, the article mentions that Luther appeared before the Diet of Worms, which was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire, with Emperor Charles V presiding. Therefore, the answer is: secular authorities.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 18 April 1521", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The question is asking for the type of assembly that the Diet of Worms was, which is not related to any of those concepts. The rule that applies is also rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The Diet of Worms is mentioned after the ban on the 95 Theses, so it can be inferred that it took place after the ban. Therefore, the answer is: an assembly that took place after the ban on the 95 Theses.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that Emperor Charles V presided over the assembly. Rule 23 establishes that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" which means that the answer is not \"Charles V,\" but rather \"Emperor Charles V.\" \nThe answer: Emperor Charles V", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Prince Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, obtained a safe conduct for Luther to and from the meeting.\nThe answer: Prince Frederick III, Elector of Saxony", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who spoke to Luther about his books, which is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we need to use rules 16 and 23 to identify the subject in the passive sentence. Rule 16 states that in a sentence, the subject comes before the verb, and rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. In this case, \"Johann Eck\" is the subject and \"presented\" is the verb, so we can identify that Johann Eck spoke to Luther about his books on behalf of the Empire.\nThe answer: Johann Eck", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question, as it does not involve either profession or nationality. However, the rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant, as the question specifically asks for the name of a person. Therefore, the answer is: the Archbishop of Trier.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify the specific question that Eck asked Luther, which is a matter of identifying the relevant information in the passage. Rule 3 tells us that we should not conflate different concepts, so we can ignore any information about Luther's response to the question. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can look for a statement that is the opposite of \"the books were his.\" The passage tells us that Eck asked Luther if the books were his and whether he stood by their contents, so the answer is \"whether he stood by their contents.\" \n\nThe answer: whether he stood by their contents", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the passage, it is mentioned that Luther prayed, consulted friends, and gave his response the next day. Therefore, his response was given the day after he was presented with the books by Johann Eck.\nThe answer: the next day", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Luther confirmed he was the author of the books, but requested time to think about whether he stood by their contents. He prayed, consulted friends, and gave his response the next day.\nThe answer: Luther confirmed he was the author of the books, but requested time to think about whether he stood by their contents.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies here, as the action of Luther raising his arm comes after the speech. \nThe answer: Luther raised his arm in the traditional salute of a knight winning a bout.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Style and salute are related to physical gestures and therefore fall under the concept of shape.\nThe answer: traditional", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article explicitly states that Michael Mullett considers Luther's speech a \"world classic of epoch-making oratory.\" The use of \"considers\" indicates that this is an opinion, and the word \"world classic\" suggests that it is a widely held opinion. The negation in the question (\"who considers\") is important to note, as it indicates that the answer should be a specific person or entity. \nThe answer: Michael Mullett", "{rule list: 7, 13, 17}\nExplanation: Michael Mullett considered Luther's speech as a \"world classic of epoch-making oratory.\"\nThe answer: world classic of epoch-making oratory", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther refused to recant his writings.\nThe answer: Luther refused to recant his writings.", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the person who said the quote \"Here I stand. I can do no other.\" Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that Luther is the person being referred to in the context. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: Luther", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The words were inserted in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the more dramatic form of words", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that private conferences were held over the next five days to determine Luther's fate. This implies that a group of people made the decision, which is an active sentence. Therefore, rule 23 applies. Additionally, the passage states that the Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms, which declared Luther an outlaw and required his arrest. This implies that the decision was made through a legal document, which is a passive sentence. Therefore, rule 16 applies.\nThe answer: Luther's fate was decided through private conferences and the presentation of the Edict of Worms by the Emperor.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies here, as the article clearly states that the private conferences were held over the next five days after a certain event, and then the Emperor presented the final draft of the Edict of Worms on May 25, 1521. \nThe answer: May 25, 1521", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: In an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question is in the passive voice, so we need to identify the subject of the sentence and the actor. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that \"the Emperor\" comes before \"the final draft of the Edict of Worms.\" Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we know that \"the final draft of the Edict of Worms\" was presented by \"the Emperor.\" \nThe answer: The Emperor.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Edict of Worms required Luther's arrest and made it a crime for anyone to give him food or shelter. It also permitted anyone to kill him without legal consequence.\nThe answer: It permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Kill him", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther's interception and stay at Wartburg Castle were planned.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Luther was intercepted by masked horsemen in the forest near Wittenberg and taken to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach.\nThe answer: Wartburg Castle at Eisenach", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"my Patmos\"", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that during his stay at Wartburg, Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German. This means that Luther translated the New Testament into German at this time.\nThe answer: the New Testament", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther shamed him into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Luther argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin.\nThe answer: sin", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Luther explained that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin and that God's grace cannot be earned, but rather it alone can make humans just. Therefore, it can be inferred that Luther explained that acquiring God's grace cannot be done through good works or earning it. \nThe answer: God's grace cannot be earned", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: August 1, 1521", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Luther argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin, implying that sin is less important than faith. Rule 2 applies because Luther emphasized that God's grace alone can make humans just, making it the most important factor. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what Luther considered greater than sin, implying that sin is of lesser importance. \nThe answer: God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make humans just.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's statement is a negation, indicating that justice does not reside in this life.\nThe answer: justice", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Luther widened his target from individual pieties to doctrines, indicating a comparison between the two. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific time period. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the word \"when,\" indicating a temporal aspect.\nThe answer: In the summer of 1521.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, Luther condemned the idea that the mass is a sacrifice, which means that he viewed it as not a sacrifice. Therefore, the answer is: Luther described the mass that was viewed as sacrifice as not a sacrifice.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Luther condemned the idea that the mass is a sacrifice and instead called it a gift to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation.\nThe answer: Luther called the mass a gift.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Luther rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution. \nThe answer: private confession and absolution", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts such as pieties, doctrines, and practices. Rule 8 applies because Luther condemned the idea of mass as a sacrifice, so he must have rejected the idea of vows as a means of salvation. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about what Luther said regarding vows. \nThe answer: Luther assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin, because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: He broadened the foundations of the Reformation by placing them on prophetic faith.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1521", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"centered\" implies a comparison between Luther's focus and other possible focuses. Rule 7 applies because \"focus\" is a synonym for \"interest.\" \nThe answer: Luther's focus was centered on the prophecy of the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9-12, 23-25.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Little Horn in Daniel 8:9-12, 23-25", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the power of the antichrist in 2 Thessalonians 2 and the Little Horn in Daniel 7", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Gabriel Zwilling", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes a timeline of events, with Andreas Karlstadt and Gabriel Zwilling embarking on a radical program of reform in Wittenberg in June 1521. Therefore, the answer can be found by identifying the timeframe mentioned in the passage. The use of rule 16 helps to identify that the question is asking for a specific time, and the use of rule 23 helps to understand that the sentence structure is passive. \nThe answer: in June 1521", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The reforms in Wittenberg exceeded anything envisaged by Luther and provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy. Therefore, the reforms caused disturbances and revolt.\nThe answer: disturbances and revolt", "{rule list: 3, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes disturbances and violence in Wittenberg after Andreas Karlstadt and Gabriel Zwilling embarked on a radical program of reform, but the situation became even more volatile after the arrival of the Zwickau prophets, who preached revolutionary doctrines. The question asks for the group responsible for causing more violence, which implies that both groups were involved in violence. Therefore, rules 3 and 7 (to distinguish between concepts) and rule 8 (to consider antonyms) are not relevant. However, rule 17 (to consider negations) is relevant because the question asks for the group responsible for causing more violence, which implies that one group caused more violence than the other. The answer is the Zwickau prophets. \nThe answer: Zwickau prophets", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Rule 22 states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last.\" In this case, the passage mentions \"the town council\" and \"Luther,\" so we can infer that Luther was asked to return by the town council.\nThe answer: The town council", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Luther returned to Wittenberg on March 6, 1522.\nThe answer: March 6, 1522.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: personal presence and living word", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: preached eight sermons", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The \"Invocavit Sermons\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther reminded the citizens to trust God's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the effect of Luther's intervention was immediate.\nThe answer: immediate", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector.\" The use of the word \"praising\" in the question indicates that the letter was positive in nature.\nThe answer: Jerome Schurf", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Schurf wrote to the elector \"after the sixth sermon.\"\nThe answer: after the sixth sermon", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the effect of Luther's return, which is the cause. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" meaning that the cause (Luther's return) comes before the effect (the joy it spread). Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the letter is expressing a positive effect. \nThe answer: Luther's return spread joy among the people and brought misguided people back to the truth.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther's words were bringing back \"misguided people\" into the way of truth. The use of the word \"misguided\" implies that these people were previously not following the truth or were misled in some way.\nThe answer: Misguided people.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Luther sought to restore public order.\nThe answer: public order", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther \"reinvented\" himself as a \"conservative force within the Reformation\", indicating that he became a more traditional and established figure within the movement. This aligns with rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts. \nThe answer: conservative force", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Luther banished the Zwickau prophets.\nThe answer: Zwickau prophets.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the negative impact caused by the radical reformers on the new order. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negative impact. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to look for a sentence where the radical reformers are the subject and something negative is happening to the new order. The answer: they threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther had to deal with \"not only the established Church but also the radical reformers.\" This implies that Luther had to deal with both the established Church and the radical reformers. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including the established Church and the radical reformers. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and other concepts, and the established Church is a religious institution rather than a profession. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, Luther had to deal with both the established Church and the radical reformers, so he was neither more nor less aligned with one group than the other. \nThe answer: the established Church", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Nicholas Storch is a preacher who helped instigate the German Peasants' War of 1524-25, during which many atrocities were committed, often in Luther's name. \nThe answer: Nicholas Storch was a preacher who helped instigate the German Peasants' War.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Storch and Muntzer helped instigate the German Peasants' War of 1524-25, during which many atrocities were committed, often in Luther's name. (rules 1 and 2 apply to \"many atrocities were committed\"; rule 3 applies to \"peasants\"; rule 4 applies to \"preachers\" and \"nationality\"; rule 5 applies to \"peasants\" and \"war\"; rule 8 applies to \"unable to stifle radicalism\"; rule 17 applies to \"unable to stifle radicalism\") \nThe answer: the German Peasants' War of 1524-25", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas M\u00fcntzer helped instigate the German Peasants' War of 1524\u201325.\" This means that the war happened in 1524-25. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that \"age\" is a different concept from the time period in which an event occurred. Rule 8 is relevant because the question asks for a specific year, and the answer provides a range of years. \nThe answer: 1524-25", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: support an attack on the upper classes in general", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the upper classes in general", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that negations are important for the answer is relevant because the question asks who Luther reminded the peasants to obey, implying that he did not support their rebellion. Therefore, the answer is that Luther reminded the peasants to obey the temporal authorities. \nThe answer: the temporal authorities.", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: Luther became angry at the widespread burning of convents, monasteries, bishops' palaces, and libraries during a tour of Thuringia.\nThe answer: Thuringia", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Luther called the peasants something negative, the answer should be the opposite of that. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Luther called the revolting peasants \"rebels like mad dogs\".", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther became enraged at the burning of various buildings, including convents, monasteries, bishops' palaces, and libraries. Therefore, he expressed the destruction as something that made him angry. Additionally, the question asks for how he expressed the destruction, implying that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Luther expressed the destruction with anger.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's call to action was directed towards the nobles, who he urged to put down the rebels like mad dogs. This is in line with rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: the nobles", "{rule list: 2, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Luther's justifications are based on three different concepts: religious doctrine (Divine Right of Kings), legal authority (law of God and Empire), and blasphemy. Therefore, rules 2, 3, and 4 are relevant. \nThe answer: three", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: ignoring it", "{3, 8, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: St. Paul wrote in his epistle to the Romans 13:1\u20137 that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted. \"All authorities\" means every authority, without exception, so there is no room for interpretation or exceptions. Therefore, rules 3 (different concepts), 8 (antonyms), 13 (names are important), 16 (order matters), and 17 (negations) are relevant.\nThe answer: God", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer is a concept or doctrine related to religion and authority. It is mentioned in the context as the \"Divine Right of Kings\". This concept is based on the belief that monarchs are appointed by God and therefore have a divine right to rule. \nThe answer: The Divine Right of Kings", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the type of death that Luther believed the revolting peasants deserved. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and not interchangeable. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, we need to look for a statement that describes the type of death that Luther believed the peasants deserved. The passage states that Luther believed the peasants deserved \"death in body and soul, if only as highwaymen and murderers.\" This means that Luther believed the peasants deserved a severe punishment, including physical death and spiritual damnation. \nThe answer: death in body and soul", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: backing for the uprising", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passive sentence \"Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen\" indicates that the subject (the rebels) was acted upon by the Swabian League. Therefore, the Swabian League defeated the rebels.\nThe answer: The Swabian League", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Battle of Frankenhausen happened \"on 15 May 1525.\" This is a specific date, which can be found by applying the rules that prioritize chronological information and passive voice constructions.\nThe answer: 15 May 1525.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence structure is in passive voice, so we need to identify the subject and object of the verb. The subject is \"the revolutionary stage of the Reformation\" and the object is \"a close.\" Therefore, the event that followed the Battle of Frankenhausen was the end of the revolutionary stage of the Reformation.\nThe answer: the end of the revolutionary stage of the Reformation", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks about the protection that allowed Luther's Reformation to flourish, implying that there was a threat to its success. Rule 3 states that concepts such as protection and success are different, so it is important to focus on the concept of protection. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that Luther's Reformation faced some sort of threat. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last,\" so we can assume that Luther's Reformation came before the anabaptist movement and other religious movements. \nThe answer: the wing of the secular powers", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Martin Luther married Katharina von Bora.\nThe answer: Katharina von Bora", "{rule list: 1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Luther arranged for the nuns to be smuggled out in herring barrels.\nThe answer: in herring barrels", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that age is a different concept from profession and nationality. We use rule 16 to determine that age comes before profession. \nThe answer: 26 years old", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that age is a different concept from profession and nationality. We use rule 16 to determine that age comes before the person's name. \nThe answer: 41 years old.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther helped the nuns escape in April 1523, which means that this event happened before Luther's marriage to Katharina. Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that the event happened before the marriage. We can also use rule 13 to understand that the names of the nuns are not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: April 1523", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther and his prospective bride were engaged on 13 June 1525.\nThe answer: 13 June 1525", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the couple was engaged in the morning of June 13th and married in the evening of the same day. \nThe answer: in the evening", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that the ceremonial walk to the church and the wedding banquet were left out. {16} First comes before last and last comes after first, so the walk to the church would have come before the wedding banquet. {22} \"The same day\" refers to the day of the engagement, which was also the day of the wedding. \nThe answer: the wedding banquet", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the wedding banquet was left out and made up two weeks later on 27 June, indicating that the banquet was celebrated on June 27th.\nThe answer: June 27th", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes the wedding of a couple and mentions that they were married by Johannes Bugenhagen. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the person who performed the marriage ceremony. Rule 23 applies because the sentence is in the passive voice, with the couple being the subject and Bugenhagen being the object. \nThe answer: Johannes Bugenhagen", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because Luther's decision to marry surprised many, indicating that they did not expect it. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" applies because the question asks about how Luther's marriage was seen by others, implying that there may have been negative reactions. The rule that \"negations in the question are important for the answer\" also applies because the question uses the word \"seen,\" which implies a subjective evaluation. \nThe answer: Luther's marriage was seen as reckless by some, including Melanchthon.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Luther's marriage was a clerical marriage, meaning a marriage between a member of the clergy and a layperson.\nThe answer: A clerical marriage.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Luther condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds.\nThe answer: on Biblical grounds", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's fear of being labeled a heretic and facing death caused him to avoid marriage.\nThe answer: fear of being labeled a heretic and facing death", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Melanchthon called the marriage reckless.\nThe answer: reckless.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Luther and his wife lived after the year 1525 when they moved into \"The Black Cloister,\" a former monastery gifted to them by the new elector John the Steadfast. They had six children together, with the youngest being born in 1534.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The Black Cloister was a former monastery.\nThe answer: a former monastery", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther and his wife had six children: Hans, Elizabeth, Magdalene, Martin, Paul, and Margaret. The order in which they are listed follows the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\"\nThe answer: six", "{rule list: 19, 20, 22}\nExplanation: Luther referred to his wife as \"Katie\" and stated that he would not exchange his poverty for the riches of Croesus.\nThe answer: poverty and life with his wife", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: Katharina helped the couple earn a living by farming the land.\nThe answer: farming the land", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Luther's Biblical ideal of congregations choosing their own ministers proved unworkable.\nThe answer: choosing their own ministers", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). Luther established a supervisory church body from 1525 to 1529. \nThe answer: a supervisory church body", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther \"laid down a new form of worship service.\" This indicates that Luther established a new worship service in his church.\nThe answer: a new form of worship service", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: two catechisms", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Luther wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality, but if he were forced to choose, he would take his stand with the masses. This means that Luther did not have a clear stance on the extent of his church.\nThe answer: Luther did not have a clear stance on the extent of his church.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: extreme change and replacing one controlling system with another.", "{rule list: 1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Luther concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony.\nThe answer: the church in the Electorate of Saxony", "{4, 15}\nExplanation: Luther acted only as an adviser to churches in new territories, many of which followed his Saxon model.\nThe answer: Luther acted as an adviser to churches in new territories.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that Luther worked closely with the new elector, John the Steadfast, for secular leadership and funds on behalf of the church. This information is presented in a passive sentence, where the subject (Luther) is acted upon the verb (worked closely with). Therefore, we need to use rules 16 and 23 to determine that John the Steadfast is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: John the Steadfast", "{3, 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relationship with the elector led to a development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign, which was originally unintended. This is because the elector authorised a visitation of the church, a power formerly exercised by bishops. Therefore, rules 3 (distinguishing between concepts of profession and government), 4 (distinguishing between concepts of nationality and government), 16 (ordering of events), and 23 (passive voice) are relevant. \nThe answer: It led to a development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that Luther wrote a German Mass in early 1526.\nThe answer: early 1526", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther intended the German Mass as an alternative for the \"simple people\", a \"public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians.\" This implies that the new mass was intended for those who were not familiar with the Latin Mass and may not have been able to understand it. Additionally, rule 8 applies because the question asks for who the new mass was intended, which is the opposite of who considered it too papistic. \nThe answer: the \"simple people\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted \"everything that smacks of sacrifice\". Therefore, he left out the parts of the original Catholic mass that involved sacrifice.\nThe answer: everything that smacks of sacrifice", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther's new German Mass made trappings such as Mass vestments, altar, and candles optional, allowing freedom of ceremony. This means that the new mass allowed for less emphasis on ceremonial aspects. Additionally, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the antonym of \"less emphasis on ceremony\" is \"more emphasis on ceremony\", so we can infer that the new mass allowed for less emphasis on ceremony. \nThe answer: The new mass allowed for less emphasis on ceremony.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther introduced the new order of worship during his visitation of the Electorate of Saxony, which began in 1527.\nThe answer: 1527", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: visitation of the Electorate of Saxony", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"Christian education,\" which is a different concept from other types of education. Additionally, the context refers to \"pastors,\" indicating that the education being assessed is related to religious teachings and not secular education.\nThe answer: Christian education", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther saw \"the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian doctrine.\" This is a negation, which is important to note according to rule 17. Additionally, the passage is referring to knowledge of a specific concept (Christian doctrine), which falls under rule 3. \nThe answer: Christian doctrine", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"many pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching.\" This is a negation, indicating that the pastors were unable to teach.\nThe answer: teach", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Luther created a catechism to teach the basics of Christianity to the congregations in an easy-to-understand way, using questions and answers to promote understanding rather than rote memorization.\nThe answer: catechism", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\". In the sentence \"In 1529, he wrote the Large Catechism\", \"1529\" comes before \"Large Catechism\", indicating that Luther wrote the Large Catechism in 1529.\nThe answer: 1529", "{3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Large Catechism was written as a manual for pastors and teachers. Therefore, it was directed to pastors and teachers.\nThe answer: pastors and teachers", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the people themselves", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: questions and answers", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The catechism", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the plan to collect his writings in volumes", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Catechism", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Small Catechism", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther's translation of the Bible", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther's Small Catechism", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther's Larger Catechism was effective for pastors, so rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) is relevant in distinguishing that being a pastor is a profession. Rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is also relevant in identifying that the Larger Catechism is the work useful for pastors. \nThe answer: Larger Catechism", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Luther wrote the Catechisms in the German vernacular, which means in the common language of the people. Additionally, there is no mention of Luther writing the Catechisms in any other language. \nThe answer: German", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks how Luther showed the Trinity in his catechisms, so the answer should focus on how he depicted the three persons of the Trinity and their roles in the believer's life, rather than on their size, shape, age, or color. The answer should also use the antonym of \"more\" to indicate that Luther did not simply teach the doctrine of the Trinity, but rather showed the persons of the Trinity as individuals to be known. \nThe answer: Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known, showing the character of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and their roles in the believer's life.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed depicts the Trinity as persons to be known, with the Father creating, the Son redeeming, and the Spirit sanctifying. Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father. The use of rule 3 is to differentiate between the concepts of salvation and the Father's role in it. Rule 8 is used to understand that Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed is not to be confused with other parts of Lutheran catechical teaching. Rule 17 is used to understand that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1522", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1534", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the translation of the Bible", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"alone\"", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"justifies us\" implies a comparison between different things that can justify us. Rule 3 applies because \"justifies us\" is related to a concept (faith) and not a physical attribute. Rule 8 applies because \"justifies us\" implies a comparison between faith and something else that could also justify us. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"not\" which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: faith alone", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and therefore irrelevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" and therefore we can infer that if Luther used a variant of German spoken at the Saxon chancellery, then he did not use a variant spoken in a different location. \nThe answer: the Saxon chancellery.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Therefore, the fact that Luther's language was intelligible to both northern and southern Germans means that it was not a matter of size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the language used by Luther was intelligible to both northern and southern Germans, so it can be inferred that it was not unintelligible to any of them. Therefore, the answer is: both northern and southern Germans.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Luther wanted everyday Germans to understand his works.\nThe answer: everyday Germans", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: Luther wanted to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans by removing impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance.\nThe answer: to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther \"intended his vigorous, direct language to make the Bible accessible to everyday Germans\" and that he wanted to \"remove impediments and difficulties so that other people may read it without hindrance.\" This implies that he removed obstacles or barriers to understanding the Bible. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply. \nThe answer: impediments and difficulties", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther's Bible was published at a time of rising demand for German-language publications. This implies that German-language publications were in demand at the time of Martin Luther. Therefore, the answer is German-language publications. \nThe answer: German-language publications", "{rule list: 3, 8, 13}\nExplanation: Luther's Bible translation became popular and influential, which is a different concept from Luther's other works. The use of \"significant contribution\" implies that Luther's Bible had a greater impact than other German-language publications. The answer does not require any information about Luther's profession or nationality.\nThe answer: Luther's Bible translation", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther's translation quickly became popular and influential, and made a significant contribution to the evolution of the German language and literature. Therefore, the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies, as Luther's translation being more popular means that other translations were less popular. Additionally, the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" applies, as popularity is not related to any of these concepts. \nThe answer: the evolution of the German language and literature", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lucas Cranach", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the influence of Luther's Bible on the evolution of the German language and literature, as well as its role in spreading Luther's doctrine throughout Germany. The passage also mentions that the Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations, including William Tyndale's English Bible. Therefore, rules 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality), 7 (synonyms), and 13 (names) are relevant. \nThe answer: William Tyndale's English Bible.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: Luther was a prolific hymn-writer\nThe answer: hymn-writing", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Luther connected high art and folk music, indicating that he used both high art and folk music to connect his hymns.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Luther used German hymns to celebrate worship.\nThe answer: German hymns", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: Luther used a lute as accompaniment to his hymns.\nThe answer: lute", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther accompanied hymns with a lute, which was later recreated as the waldzither and became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century.\nThe answer: waldzither", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Luther's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views. Therefore, Luther wrote hymns in response to specific events. \nThe answer: Specific events in his life and the unfolding Reformation.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes were the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views. The use of \"martyred\" implies that they were killed for their beliefs, which is a passive construction. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to consider the opposite of \"martyred,\" which is \"executed.\" Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so the answer is that they were executed for their Lutheran views by the Catholic Church.\nThe answer: for their Lutheran views", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Ein neues Lied wir heben an\" (or \"Flung to the Heedless Winds\" in English)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: John C.

Therefore, we can infer that Luther wrote the hymn before 1525.\nThe answer: before 1525", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther's 1529 three-part explanation of the Apostles' Creed in the Small Catechism", "{rule list: 3, 10, 11, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions Luther's three-part explanation of the Apostles' Creed in the Small Catechism, but does not provide any information about the location of the Apostles. Therefore, the answer is: N/A (not applicable).", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an earlier German creedal hymn", "{rule list: 3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The answer mentions the \"perceived difficulty of its tune,\" which implies that the reason for modern Lutherans not using the hymn is negative. Therefore, we need to consider negations in the question and rule out any positive reasons for not using the hymn. Additionally, we need to ignore contractions in the question. Finally, we need to note that the reason for not using the hymn is related to its tune, which falls under the concept of \"shape.\" \nThe answer: because of the perceived difficulty of its tune.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther produced a hymnic version of the Lord's Prayer in 1538. This is a straightforward answer that can be found by identifying the verb \"produced\" and the specific year mentioned in the sentence.\nThe answer: 1538", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism", "{rule list: 2, 13}\nExplanation: The hymn \"Vater unser im Himmelreich\" functioned as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions.\nThe answer: specific catechism questions", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the extant manuscript of Luther's hymnic version of the Lord's Prayer shows multiple revisions, demonstrating Luther's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune.\nThe answer: multiple revisions", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The later versions of the Lord's Prayer hymn still use Luther's tune.\nThe answer: Luther's tune", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Luther wrote \"Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir\" in 1523. \nThe answer: Luther wrote the hymn in 1523.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Psalm 130", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: write psalm-hymns for use in German worship", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"this and seven other hymns were published in the Achtliederbuch, the first Lutheran hymnal.\" This indicates that the Achtliederbuch was the first Lutheran hymnal.\nThe answer: Achtliederbuch", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: essential Reformation doctrine", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify which of Luther's hymns became the main one for Advent. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as age, shape, size, and color are different and cannot be compared. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Using this rule, we can see that \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" was mentioned first and \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" was mentioned second, so the former is the answer. \nThe answer: \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\"", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage lists several hymns written by Luther and the hymns they were based on. The answer can be found by identifying the hymn mentioned in the question and the hymn it was based on.\nThe answer: Veni redemptor gentium", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: A Hauptlied is a main hymn for a specific occasion.\nThe answer: a main hymn for a specific occasion", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther wrote two hymns on the Ten Commandments, \"Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot\" and \"Mensch, willst du leben seliglich\". \nThe answer: two", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Luther paraphrased the Te Deum as \"Herr Gott, dich loben wir\" with a simplified form of the melody. The question asks what this hymn became known as. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so the fact that the hymn was simplified is not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the name of the hymn is the key piece of information. \nThe answer: German Te Deum", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: baptism", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Johann Walter's", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Psalm 67 is a prayer for grace.\nThe answer: a prayer for grace", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: J.

This information is given in the passage and follows rules 4 and 16, which state that profession and nationality are different concepts and that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: early Lutheran hymnals", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: four", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther supplied 18 out of 26 songs in the Erfurt Enchiridion.\nThe answer: 18", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 24", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the first choral hymnal is being referred to in the sentence. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the title of the hymnal is \"Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn\" since it is the object of the sentence. \nThe answer: Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Johann Sebastian Bach", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Bach based chorale cantatas entirely on Luther's hymns. This indicates that Bach based his entire cantatas on Luther's chorales.\nThe answer: chorale cantatas", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Bach based his chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden entirely on Luther's hymn as early as possibly 1707, in his second annual cycle. This means that 1707 is the earliest possible year that Bach began using Luther hymns.\nThe answer: 1707", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Bach used Luther's hymns in his cantatas as early as possibly 1707, and continued to use them in his second annual cycle from 1724 to 1725, and later in 1735.\nThe answer: 1707, 1724-1725, 1735.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to find the last use of Luther's work by Bach, which implies a chronological order. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\". Rule 23 tells us that passive voice is used in the sentence \"W\u00e4r Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit, BWV 14\", which means that this is the last use of Luther's work by Bach.\nThe answer: 1735", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death, so the answer is that Luther believed that the soul sleeps after death. \nThe answer: The soul sleeps after death.", "3, 8, 17\nExplanation: Luther rejected the idea of torments for the saints and the existence of Purgatory, which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death. Therefore, the answer is that Luther disavowed the doctrines of torments for the saints and Purgatory.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Luther's view on the afterlife is in contrast to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon. Rule 3 applies because Luther disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages. Rule 8 applies because Luther maintained that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell. \nThe answer: Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christian's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Luther rejected the existence of Purgatory and the idea of Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death. Rule 3 applies because the concept of Purgatory is different from the concepts of sleep and peace after death. Rule 4 applies because Luther's profession as a theologian is different from his religious beliefs. Rule 17 applies because the negation \"rejected\" in the question is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Luther rejected the existence of Purgatory.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for where Luther described the resting place of the saints, which is a specific location. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can look for the first mention of a location in the passage. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" so we can look for an active sentence where Luther is the subject. The sentence \"In his Smalcald Articles, he described the saints as currently residing 'in their graves and in heaven'\" is an active sentence where Luther is the subject and describes the location of the saints. \nThe answer: \"in their graves and in heaven\"", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"differed\" implies a comparison between Luther's view and the view of later theologians. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for who noticed the difference, which implies that the difference was significant enough to be noticed. \nThe answer: Franz Pieper", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the mention of theologian in the question is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a theologian who had a different view from Luther. \nThe answer: Johann Gerhard.", "{3, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Lessing (1755) had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of Lutheran orthodoxy on this issue.\"\nThe answer: Lessing", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Lessing reached his conclusions earlier than Gerhard, so we can infer that Gerhard reached his conclusions after 1755.\nThe answer: after 1755", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther's Commentary on Genesis", "{rule list: 1, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther\". Rule 1 applies because \"misunderstood\" is the antonym of \"understood\". Rule 7 applies because \"misread\" is a synonym of \"misunderstood\". Rule 13 applies because the name \"John Jortin\" is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Francis Blackburne", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1765", "{3, 8, 13, 16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage under dispute is about whether the soul sleeps or experiences visions. Francis Blackburne argued that Luther's passage was misread, while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out that it actually refers to the soul of a man \"in this life\" tired from his daily labor who at night enters his bedchamber and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams. Fritschel is the one who pointed out that the passage refers to a living man.\nThe answer: Gottfried Fritschel", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: dreams", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific event in time, which can be answered by identifying the subject (Philip I), the action (convoked an assembly), and the object (German and Swiss theologians) in the sentence. The sentence is in the past tense, indicating that the event already happened. Rule 16 helps determine the order of events, and rule 23 helps identify the passive voice in the sentence. \nThe answer: October 1529", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Landgrave of Hesse", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Marburg Colloquy was meant to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states, except for the nature of the Eucharist. \nThe answer: Doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states, except for the nature of the Eucharist.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" applies because the article states that \"Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen.\" The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because the question asks for the number of points agreed on, not disagreed on. \nThe answer: 14", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen, the exception being the nature of the Eucharist.\" This means that the one point not agreed on was the nature of the Eucharist. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"nature\" are different from concepts such as \"size\" or \"color.\" Rule 8 states that if one thing is not agreed on, it is the opposite of what the other thing is. \nThe answer: The nature of the Eucharist.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the body and blood of Christ (Real Presence)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine, which he called the sacramental union. Therefore, the answer is sacramental union. \nThe answer: sacramental union", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and antonyms, which are important for understanding the contrast between Luther's belief in the Real Presence and his opponents' belief in only spiritual or symbolic presence. Rule 3 is relevant because it emphasizes that concepts like presence and significance are distinct from each other. Rule 4 is relevant because it highlights the difference between profession and nationality, which is not relevant to this question but may be relevant to other questions. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains how to handle comparisons between two entities. Rule 17 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of negations in understanding the meaning of a sentence. \nThe answer: Luther's opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes a debate between theologians about the significance of Jesus' words at the Last Supper. The debate sometimes became confrontational, as evidenced by the exchange between Zwingli and Luther. This suggests that negations are important for the answer (rule 17) and that the sentence structure may be in the passive voice (rule 23).\nThe answer: The meeting often became confrontational.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing of the Augsburg Confession. Therefore, the Augsburg Confession was signed after the Marburg Colloquy. \nThe answer: 1530", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing of the Augsburg Confession.\nThe answer: the Marburg Colloquy", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the formation of the Schmalkaldic League the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as John of Saxony, Philip of Hesse, and George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach.\" This indicates that the Protestant nobles formed the Schmalkaldic League.\nThe answer: Schmalkaldic League", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the Swiss cities, however, did not sign these agreements.\" This is a clear negation that answers the question. The rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that disagreements on one topic (the Eucharist) do not necessarily imply disagreements on other topics (signing the agreements). The rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: the Swiss cities", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Scholars sometimes assert that Luther believed that faith and reason were antithetical and that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason. \nThe answer: Luther believed that faith and reason were antithetical.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as faith and reason are different. Rule 8 states that if A thinks X is impossible, absurd, and false, then B thinks that X is possible, reasonable, and true. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is reason. \nThe answer: reason", "{1, 2, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Luther asserted that reason is the greatest enemy that faith has. Rule 2 applies because he also wrote that human reason \"strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it\". Rule 3 applies because faith and reason are different concepts. Rule 8 applies because Luther's statements imply that reason and faith are antonyms. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for how Luther said reason contributes to faith. \nThe answer: Luther said that reason in no way contributes to faith.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Luther believed that reason was the greatest enemy of faith. (rule 8 - if A is X, then B is more antonym(X) than A) \nThe answer: Reason", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. This means that separating faith and reason is a separation of different spheres of knowledge, which Luther honors. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question is in the form of an active sentence, so the answer is the object of the verb \"honor\", which is \"the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to\".\nThe answer: the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are relevant because they establish that concepts such as mistreatment and conversion are different from each other, and that the negation in the question is important for the answer. Rule 7 is relevant because the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 8 is relevant because the question asks about what Luther stated, which is a profession. Rule 17 is relevant because the negation in the question is important for the answer. \nThe answer: that Jesus Christ was born a Jew", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that \"In his later years, Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists, Zwinglianism, and the papacy.\" The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more hostile than B, then B is less hostile than A), 3 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 8 (if A is hostile towards B, then B is friendly towards A), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: Jews.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's treatment of Jews is being compared to his treatment of another group, indicating that profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4). The question uses the word \"like,\" which implies a comparison and therefore requires consideration of negations (rule 17). \nThe answer: The question does not provide enough information to determine the answer.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage that states \"His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren L\u00fcgen (On the Jews and Their Lies) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times, although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme, even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe.\" \nThe answer: 1543", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that Luther saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians, indicating that he viewed them as a threat. Rule 3 applies because size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to Luther's view of the Turks. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about Luther's view of the Turks, not the other way around. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about Luther's view of the Turks, and negations are important for understanding his perspective. \nThe answer: Luther saw the Ottoman Turks as a threat.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to punish Christians by God, as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist, whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Luther believed that the Turks were a scourge sent to punish Christians by God, as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist, whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church. \nThe answer: to punish Christians by God", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the papacy", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Luther supported non-religious war against the Turks, in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms. The answer specifies that he did not oppose a religious war, so rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) is relevant. Rules 3 and 4 are also relevant to ensure that the answer is not confused with a religious war. \nThe answer: secular war", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Luther read a Latin translation of the Qur'an.\nThe answer: Qur'an", "{rule list: 2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Luther produced critical pamphlets on Islam\nThe answer: critical pamphlets", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: \"Mohammedanism\" and \"the Turk\" are terms used by Luther to refer to Islam and Muslims, respectively. According to rule 3, different concepts such as names and concepts are not interchangeable. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, Luther's use of \"Mohammedanism\" and \"the Turk\" to refer to Islam and Muslims respectively implies a negative connotation, so the antonym of this connotation would be positive, meaning that Islam and Muslims are not negative concepts. \nThe answer: Islam and Muslims", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Luther's view of Islam as a tool of the devil implies that he saw it as a negative force. Rule 3 applies because Luther's view of Islam as a tool of the devil is a different concept from his indifference to its practice. Rule 4 applies because Luther's view of Islam is a different concept from his nationality or profession. Rule 8 applies because Luther's view of Islam as a tool of the devil implies that he saw it as less good than Christianity. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about Luther's view of Islam, and the negation \"indifferent\" is important to the answer. \nThe answer: Luther saw Islam as a tool of the devil, but was indifferent to its practice.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Luther's opposition to banning the publication of the Qur'an suggests that he believed in the importance of free speech and the ability to scrutinize different beliefs and ideas, regardless of whether he agreed with them or not. Therefore, the purpose of Luther not wanting to ban the Qur'an was to uphold the principle of free speech and allow for open discussion and debate. \nThe answer: to uphold the principle of free speech and allow for open discussion and debate.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for what Johannes Agricola preached that God's gospel revealed. The passage states that Agricola claimed that God's gospel, not God's moral law (the Ten Commandments), revealed God's wrath to Christians. Therefore, the answer is that Agricola preached that God's gospel revealed God's wrath to Christians. \nThe answer: God's wrath to Christians", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Johannes Agricola", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: According to the article, Agricola claimed that God's gospel, not God's moral law, revealed God's wrath to Christians. This suggests that Agricola believed that the law should not be in control of Christians. \nThe answer: the law belonged only to city hall", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Luther responded with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians, as well as other writings such as an open letter and a book.", "{3, 4, 8, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the book that Luther wrote in response to Agricola and the antinomians. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse concepts, so we need to focus on the book. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about Luther's profession or nationality. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can look for information about what Luther wrote against Agricola and the antinomians. Rule 13 tells us that names are important, so we need to pay attention to the names of the people involved. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last, so we need to look for information about Luther's book after the information about the disputations. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important, so we need to pay attention to any negative statements. \nThe answer: On the Councils and the Church", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is what Luther's answer to the antinomians reaffirms. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A is X, then B is antonym(X). Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 is relevant because it establishes that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Luther's answer reaffirms the \"second use of the law,\" which is the law as the Holy Spirit's tool to work sorrow over sin in man's heart, preparing him for Christ's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to work sorrow over sin in man's heart, thus preparing him for Christ's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Everything that is used to work sorrow over sin, including Christ's life, Christ's death for sin, or God's goodness experienced in creation.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians does not eliminate the accusing law.\nThe answer: eliminate the accusing law", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: only essentially holy people", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for what the Ten Commandments teach Christians how to do.

The answer is that the Ten Commandments positively teach how the Christian ought to live.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Luther believes that the Ten Commandments, when considered as an expression of God's eternal will or natural law, positively teach how Christians should live. This is the \"third use of the law.\" \nThe answer: The Ten Commandments", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the \"third use of the law,\" which teaches Christians how they should live. The use of the word \"teach\" in the question indicates that the answer is referring to a positive use of the law, rather than a condemning one. Therefore, rules 3 and 17 are relevant, as they establish that concepts such as \"teaching\" and \"negations\" are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The \"third use of the law\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an illustration of the Ten Commandments", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Ten Commandments", "{4, 12, 16, 19}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify \"Christian\" as a religious affiliation rather than a profession. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the mention of the Ten Commandments and the eschatological overtones. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify \"baptism\" as the sacrament mentioned last in the sentence. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can identify \"Christians\" as a group that includes people of all genders.\nThe answer: baptism", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Ten Commandments...are a present foreshadowing of the believers' future angel-like life in heaven.\" This implies that the Ten Commandments show the future of heaven to Christians. \nThe answer: The Ten Commandments", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The Ten Commandments are not asking anything of the Christians, but rather are a set of rules that Christians are expected to follow. The question contains a negation, which is important to consider. \nThe answer: The Ten Commandments are a set of rules that Christians are expected to follow.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks about Philip I's intentions in 1539, which is a specific point in time. Rule 1 applies because it compares Philip I's wishes to a previous state. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"wish\" which implies a desire rather than a concrete action. Rule 3 applies because the question is not about the size, shape, age, or color of anything. Rule 4 applies because the question is not about Philip I's nationality or profession. Rule 5 applies because the question is not about animals or vehicles. Rule 6 applies because the question is not about animals or vehicles. Rule 7 applies because the question contains synonyms for words in the context. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about Philip I's wishes, which is a comparison of more or less.

Rule 17 applies because it emphasizes the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Luther", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: lasting damage", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Luther lived in a community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. This is a historical fact that is mentioned in the passage and is not subject to interpretation. Therefore, Rule 3 (age) and Rule 16 (first comes before last) are relevant.\nThe answer: expelled Jews", "{1, 3, 12, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, so it can be inferred that Jews were more present in his writings than in his personal experience. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific group of people that Luther wrote about, which is a different concept than his personal encounters with them. Rule 12 applies because the passage contains information that is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a specific group of people, and names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Jews", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther's attitudes towards Jews reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including guilt and belief. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which are not relevant to this question. Rule 17 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: The murder of Christ.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Jews rejected the divinity of Jesus, which caused Luther to consider them blasphemers and liars. According to rule 3, religion is a different concept from other concepts such as shape or color. According to rule 8, if A considers B more X than C, then A considers C more antonym(X) than B. Therefore, Luther considered Jews who rejected the divinity of Jesus as blasphemers and liars. \nThe answer: the divinity of Jesus", "{rule list: 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Luther initially advised kindness towards the Jews and aimed to convert them to Christianity, but when his efforts failed, he grew increasingly bitter towards them. \nThe answer: Luther tried to convert the Jews to Christianity.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's major work on the Jews was his treatise \"Von den Juden und Ihren L\u00fcgen\" (On the Jews and Their Lies).\nThe answer: \"Von den Juden und Ihren L\u00fcgen\"", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the publication date of Luther's treatise \"On the Jews and Their Lies\". Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"large\" to describe the work, which implies that there may be other works by Luther on the same topic. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the year of publication, which is a specific detail. \nThe answer: 1543", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the work was published three years before Luther's death. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence \"both published in 1543, three years before his death\" is in the passive voice, with \"both\" as the subject and \"published\" as the verb.\nThe answer: three years before his death", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"the devil's people\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a sanction for murder", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony.\nThe answer: the Jews", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Martin Luther", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Josel of Rosheim claimed that Luther said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition.\nThe answer: doomed to perdition", "{7, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for what Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of. Rule 7 is relevant because the answer may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 17 is relevant because negations are important for the answer. Rule 23 is relevant because the sentence structure is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: Luther's anti-Jewish works", "{rule list: 3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Throughout the 1580s, riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states.\"\nThe answer: Throughout the 1580s", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"most widely read\" implies a comparison to other writers of his generation. Rule 3 applies because \"widely read\" refers to popularity, while \"author\" refers to profession. Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a person's name.\nThe answer: Luther", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: These rules cover concepts such as comparisons, synonyms, gender pronouns, and negations, which are all relevant to understanding the question and extracting the answer. \nThe answer: Luther's anti-Jewish rhetoric", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Luther's rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany, then it can be inferred that his rhetoric was used as a basis for the Nazis' attacks on Jews. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer, so it is important to note that Luther's anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed to the development of antisemitism in Germany, which later provided an \"ideal underpinning\" for the Nazis' attacks on Jews. \nThe answer: Luther's anti-Jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany, which later provided an \"ideal underpinning\" for the Nazis' attacks on Jews.", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the author whose writings were widely quoted by the Third Reich. The passage states that just about every anti-Jewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther, and that Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940. Therefore, the answer is Luther.\nThe answer: Luther", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the most radically anti-Semitic tract ever published", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 17 December 1941", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for who suggested the expulsion of Jews from Germany. The passage mentions that the Protestant regional church confederations agreed with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge, \"since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory.\" Therefore, the answer is Martin Luther. \nThe answer: Martin Luther", "{1, 3, 7, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who claimed that Luther's writings were a blueprint for actions against Jews. This involves understanding the meaning of the word \"blueprint\" in this context, which is a plan or model for action. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps to understand that Luther's writings were seen as a basis for action against Jews. Rule 3 is relevant because it emphasizes that the concepts of religion and ethnicity are different. Rule 7 is relevant because it highlights the importance of understanding synonyms in the question. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes that names are important for the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because it emphasizes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Daniel Goldhagen", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify who agreed with the burning of synagogues. Rule 1 tells us that if A agrees with B, then B agrees with A. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we need to pay attention to the religious affiliation of the individuals mentioned in the article. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. The answer: Bishop Martin Sasse.", "{rule list: 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Sasse proclaimed Luther to be \"the greatest antisemite of his time\"\nThe answer: an antisemite", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 22}\nExplanation: Scholars' debate about Luther's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis. Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Martin Brecht believed that Luther's stand on the Jews had the evil result of making him one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism, but he also pointed out that there is a world of difference between Luther's belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Therefore, Brecht called Luther's stand on the Jews \"misguided agitation.\" \nThe answer: misguided agitation", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's agitation provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews.\nThe answer: modern hatred of the Jews", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in the 18th and 19th centuries", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Luther's views were anti-Judaic, which means he was opposed to Judaism and its adherence rather than the Jews as an ethnic group. However, some scholars argue that the violence in his views added a new element to the standard Christian suspicion of Judaism, and that Luther \"Germanized\" the Christian critique of Judaism and established anti-Semitism as a key element of German culture and national identity. Therefore, the answer is that Luther's words lent an element of anti-Semitism to Christian suspicion of Jews. \nThe answer: anti-Semitism", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: These rules cover concepts such as comparisons, synonyms, antonyms, gender, negations, and passive voice. They help to identify the relevant information in the passage and understand the meaning of the question. \nThe answer: Ronald Berger", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a \"hysterical and demonizing mentality\" about Jews", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for who aided the Reich in Germany in antisemitism, which implies that the answer is a person or group of people. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can't assume that all Germans or all Lutherans aided the Reich in antisemitism. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negation in the question (\"who aided\" instead of \"who caused\"). The answer: German Lutheran clergy and theologians.", "{3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding that the Lutheran clerics used Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify the anti-Semitic policies of the National Socialists. This involves recognizing the negative views of Jews held by Luther and how they were used by the Nazi regime. Relevant rules include: 3 (distinguishing between concepts), 4 (distinguishing between profession and nationality), 5 (distinguishing between animals and vehicles), 7 (synonyms in the question), 8 (antonyms), 10 (contractions in the question), 13 (names are important), 17 (negations), 18 (negations in the question), and 23 (active vs passive voice). \nThe answer: Luther's hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion.", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a possible cause of Luther's antisemitism, implying that there may be multiple causes. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a possible cause, not a definite cause. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the word \"suggest,\" indicating that the answer may not be a definite fact. \nThe answer: a declining state of mind", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: As Luther's health deteriorated, his antisemitic views developed, suggesting that his declining state of mind may have played a role in their development. Therefore, according to rule 1, his declining health means that his mental state was less healthy than before. According to rule 2, Luther's views were increasingly antisemitic, meaning that they were becoming more extreme. \nThe answer: his health", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: Luther often deliberately used \"vulgarity and violence\" for effect\nThe answer: vulgarity and violence", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther used violent rhetoric against \"Turks\" (Muslims) and Catholics. Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as religions, are distinct. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: \"Turks\" (Muslims) and Catholics.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Mark U. Edwards is a scholar is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name \"Edwards\" in the passage. \nThe answer: Luther's Last Battles: Politics and Polemics 1531\u201346", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the repudiation of Luther's statements implies that they are considered prejudiced and unacceptable. Rule 4 applies because the repudiation is attributed to Lutheran Church denominations, which are institutions rather than individuals. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negation (\"when have Lutheran Churches repudiated...\") and the answer requires understanding that the repudiation happened in the past, specifically since the 1980s.\nThe answer: Since the 1980s.", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The survey found that Lutherans were the least prejudiced toward Jews compared to other minority groups.\nThe answer: least prejudiced", "{1, 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a comparison between Protestants and Catholics. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about a person's research, which is related to their profession. Rule 16 applies because the question asks about who found the information, which implies a chronological order. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a negation. \nThe answer: Richard (Dick) Geary", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1928-1933", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes Luther's health as deteriorating during the years of 1531 to 1546, with various illnesses and conditions affecting him. Rule 1 applies because the passage compares Luther's health during this time to his previous health. Rule 2 applies because the passage describes Luther's health as very poor during this time, with multiple conditions affecting him. Rule 3 applies because the passage describes different aspects of Luther's health, such as his ear infection and kidney stones. Rule 8 applies because the passage describes Luther's health as worse than it had been before. \nThe answer: Luther's health deteriorated further.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify what Luther began to experience in 1536. We can use rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 to determine that the different health issues listed are separate concepts and not related to each other. Rule 10 tells us that contractions in the question are irrelevant, so we can ignore \"what did\" and focus on \"Luther begin to experience in 1536.\" Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant, so we can ignore the other health issues mentioned. Finally, we can use rule 17 to determine that the negation \"begin to\" is important for the answer.\nThe answer: kidney and bladder stones.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage lists several health issues that Luther suffered from, including M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, vertigo, fainting, tinnitus, a cataract in one eye, kidney and bladder stones, arthritis, and angina.\nThe answer: kidney and bladder stones, arthritis, and angina.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Luther's health had been deteriorating for years, including suffering from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, vertigo, fainting, tinnitus, and a cataract in one eye. In 1536, he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones, and arthritis, and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum. By December 1544, he began to feel the effects of angina.\nThe answer: angina", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther's poor physical health made him short-tempered, which implies that he was already short-tempered to begin with. Therefore, we can infer that his poor physical health made him even more short-tempered than usual. \nThe answer: his poor physical health", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Luther's poor physical health made him short-tempered and harsher in his writings and comments.\nThe answer: None (the passage does not provide information on how Luther's health affected other aspects of his life)", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: As Luther's physical health declined, he became \"short-tempered and even harsher\" in his writings and comments. This means that his writings sounded more negative and critical as he became less healthy.\nThe answer: negative and critical", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The passage mentions Luther's wife Katharina scolding him for being too rude.\nThe answer: Katharina", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther preached three times in the Market Church in Halle during Christmas in 1545 and 1546, while staying with his friend Justus Jonas.\nThe answer: three times", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it is stated that Luther's last sermon was delivered at Eisleben, his place of birth, three days before his death. The answer is: Eisleben.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the passage, which states that Luther's last sermon was delivered on 15 February 1546, three days before his death. The answer is \"15 February 1546\".", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rules selected are 1 (to understand the relationship between Luther's views and those of the Jews), 3 (to differentiate between the different concepts mentioned in the passage), 4 (to understand that profession and nationality are different concepts), 8 (to understand the relationship between Luther's views and those of the Jews), and 17 (to understand the importance of negations in the question). \nThe answer: The focus of Luther's last sermon was on expelling the Jews from German territory.", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what is stated in the passage (\"from where\" instead of \"from where not\"). Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a location, which is a different concept from the content of Luther's sermon. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the location that Luther wanted to expel the Jews from, which is the opposite of what he wanted. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the location that Luther wanted to expel the Jews from, and the negation \"from where not\" is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Luther wanted to expel the Jews from all German territory.", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what Luther said about the Jews. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for what would allow the Jews to stay, which is the opposite of what Luther said about expelling them. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what Luther said would allow the Jews to stay, and negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: If they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Luther's final journey was to Mansfeld.\nThe answer: Mansfeld", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Luther was involved in negotiations for a settlement with the Mansfeld counts.\nThe answer: negotiations for a settlement", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Luther traveled to Mansfeld twice in late 1545.\nThe answer: late 1545", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther made two visits to Mansfeld in late 1545 for negotiations and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion. Therefore, the third visit was scheduled in early 1546.\nThe answer: early 1546", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: his siblings' families", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546, as stated in the passage.\nThe answer: 17 February 1546", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: chest pains", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Luther's prayer is directly quoted in the passage, indicating that the exact wording is important. The use of the word \"common\" suggests that this prayer was well-known and commonly used, which supports the idea that it is a direct quote. The negation in the question (\"quoting\" instead of \"praying\") is important to note, as Luther was not simply quoting scripture but using it as a prayer in his final moments.\nThe answer: \"Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God\" (Ps. 31:5)", "{rule list: 3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Psalm 31:5 is a prayer that Luther recited on his deathbed, committing his spirit to God. Contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: \"Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"At 1 a.m. he awoke with more chest pain\". The question asks for a specific time, which is given in the passage. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb), as the sentence is in the passive voice and the time is the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: At 1 a.m.", "{rule list: 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes that \"an apoplectic stroke deprived him of his speech.\"\nThe answer: apoplectic stroke", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Martin Luther died at 2:45 a.m. on February 18, 1546.\nThe answer: 2:45 a.m.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Luther died \"on 18 February 1546.\"\nThe answer: 18 February 1546", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Luther was buried in the Castle Church in Wittenberg, beneath the pulpit.\nThe answer: in the Castle Church in Wittenberg, beneath the pulpit.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Johannes Bugenhagen performed the funeral before Philipp Melanchthon. Rule 23 establishes that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which means that the funeral was performed by Bugenhagen and Melanchthon. \nThe answer: Johannes Bugenhagen and Philipp Melanchthon.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"a piece of paper was later found on which Luther had written his last statement.\" This indicates that Luther wrote a statement before his death. The statement was in Latin, except for the phrase \"We are beggars,\" which was in German. \nThe answer: his last statement, which included the phrase \"We are beggars\" in German.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the statement was \"in Latin, apart from 'We are beggars,' which was in German.\"\nThe answer: Latin", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"We are beggars,\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so the fact that Luther was depicted as physically imposing is important to note. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that Catholic saints were depicted as frail in contrast to Luther's imposing figure. \nThe answer: printed images that emphasized Luther's monumental size", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Catholic saints were portrayed as frail.\nThe answer: frail", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: Luther was presented as a physically imposing figure with a large body, in contrast to frail Catholic saints, to emphasize his equal stature to secular German princes and his rejection of the ascetic life of medieval religious orders. This was done through printed images, such as woodcuts by Hans Brosamer and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Younger.\nThe answer: Luther was presented as a physically imposing figure with a large body.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size is a different concept from others, and the rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the image of Luther, which emphasized his large size, was a contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders, who typically lived a life of self-denial and abstention from earthly pleasures. \nThe answer: the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1530s and 1540s", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The Church of Luther honors him on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints.\nThe answer: 18 February", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: Luther is commemorated on the Church of England's Calendar of Saints on 31 October.\nThe answer: Church of England's Calendar of Saints", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The Church of England commemorates Luther on 31 October.\nThe answer: 31 October.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Luther is commemorated on 31 October in the Church of England's Calendar of Saints.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about how Luther is honored on different calendars, implying that there may be differences in how he is honored. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the specific way in which Luther is commemorated, which is a different concept than his overall honor. \nThe answer: Luther is commemorated on 18 February in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints, on an unspecified date in the Episcopal (United States) Calendar of Saints, and on 31 October in the Church of England's Calendar of Saints.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The abbreviation for Southern California is given in the first sentence of the article. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Southern California is a region is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"abbreviated\" and \"abbreviated as\" can be considered equivalent. \nThe answer: SoCal", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the region is traditionally described as \"eight counties\", but also mentions a more extensive 10-county definition. Therefore, the actual number of counties in the region is 10.\nThe answer: 10", "{3, 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Southern California is a major economic center for both California and the United States. This importance is not related to size, shape, age, or color, nor to profession or nationality. The passage also does not mention any specific locations or names. Therefore, rules 3, 4, and 12 are relevant to eliminate irrelevant information, and rule 17 is relevant to consider the negation in the question. \nThe answer: Southern California is a major economic center for California and the United States.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The \"eight counties\" are described based on demographics and economic ties.\nThe answer: demographics and economic ties", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the 10-county definition of Southern California includes Kern and San Luis Obispo counties based on historical political divisions. This means that the reasons for adding these two counties are based on political factors. \nThe answer: historical political divisions", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the Southern California Megaregion, which is not defined by the 8- or 10-county definitions. This is a matter of geographic boundaries, which falls under the concept of \"location\" (rule 3). The passage also mentions that the megaregion extends into Las Vegas, Nevada and Tijuana, Mexico, which are different nationalities (rule 4). \nThe answer: Southern California Megaregion", "{rule list: 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a number, so rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and rule 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer) do not apply. Rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) is also not relevant. The answer is not explicitly stated in the article, so external knowledge is required. According to the article, Southern California is one of the 11 megaregions in the United States, so the answer is 11. \nThe answer: 11", "{3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The megaregion's area is more expansive, extending east into Las Vegas, Nevada, and south across the Mexican border into Tijuana.\" \nThe answer: Nevada", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The article states that the Southern California Megaregion extends south across the Mexican border into Tijuana.\nThe answer: the Mexican border", "{3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific number of counties in the megaregion is not relevant to the answer. Names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that the area past the border has a specific name is important. Negations are important for the answer, so we need to focus on the area that the megaregion extends into, not the area that it does not use for its definition. \nThe answer: Tijuana.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article describes Southern California as \"stretching along the Pacific coast\", indicating that it touches the Pacific Ocean.\nThe answer: Pacific coast", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Southern California's population encompasses seven metropolitan areas. \nThe answer: seven", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The Los Angeles area is one of the seven metropolitan areas in Southern California, and it consists of Los Angeles and Orange counties. It has over 12 million inhabitants.\nThe answer: over 12 million inhabitants", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We can use rule 3 to determine that size is a different concept from location, and rule 16 to determine that \"least\" refers to the smallest number. Therefore, the answer is the San Diego area with over 3 million inhabitants.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that for CSA metropolitan purposes, the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura are all combined to make up the Greater Los Angeles Area with over 17.5 million people. Therefore, the answer is over 17.5 million. \nThe answer: over 17.5 million", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\". Therefore, the answer is the Colorado River. \n\nThe answer: the Colorado River", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that to the east of the location in question is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River at the border with Arizona. This indicates that the name of the desert on the border of Arizona is the Colorado Desert.\nThe answer: Colorado Desert", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" allows us to focus on the relevant information in the passage, which is the mention of the Mojave Desert being near the border with Nevada. Rule 12 tells us that irrelevant information can be ignored. \nThe answer: Mojave Desert", "{rule list: locations are equally important for the answer, negations are important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the border to the south, so we need to focus on the location information in the passage. The passage states that to the south is the \"Mexico-United States border.\" The question does not contain any negations, so we do not need to consider any negations in the passage.\nThe answer: Mexico-United States border", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the state that Los Angeles and San Diego are a part of. Rule 14 states that locations are equally important for the answer, so we know that the answer will be a state. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore the population numbers given in the article. Therefore, the answer is California. \nThe answer: California.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule about size is relevant because the question asks for a specific population number. The rule about first and last is relevant because the question asks for the population of Los Angeles, which is the first city mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: 3,792,621", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the most populous city, which implies a comparison with other cities. Rule 3 applies because the question is about size. \nThe answer: Los Angeles", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: San Diego", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that San Diego is \"to the south\" of Los Angeles.\nThe answer: south", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the five counties are Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino, and Riverside. Since Orange, San Diego, Riverside, and San Bernardino are already mentioned, the last county must be Los Angeles. \nThe answer: Los Angeles", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the counties are the most populous in the state and in the top 15 most populous counties in the United States is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the counties are in California, then the answer is the United States. \nThe answer: United States", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: These are the names of counties in California.\nThe answer: counties in California", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept from other concepts means that we cannot assume that the counties are ranked in any particular order. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B means that if all five counties are in the top 15 most populous counties in the United States, then the lowest ranking one could be 15th. \nThe answer: 15th", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage only mentions counties in Southern California, so the smallest geographical region discussed is a county.\nThe answer: county", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a name associated with the motion picture industry, which is Hollywood. The irrelevant information about the location being in southern California and the list of companies headquartered there can be ignored. \nThe answer: Hollywood", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the city that the Hollywood district belongs to. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Los Angeles", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that owning a company is not related to the nationality of the company. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts tells us that companies are not related to animals or vehicles. Therefore, we use the rule that names are equally important for the answer to determine that The Walt Disney Company owns ABC.\nThe answer: The Walt Disney Company", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The rules state that professions and industries are different concepts, and that animals and vehicles are also different concepts. Therefore, we can infer that the answer must be an industry that is not related to motion pictures or television. The passage does not mention any other industry specifically, so the answer is \"none\" or \"there is no other major industry mentioned in the article.\"", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts and the rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts are not relevant to this question. The answer can be found in the passage that states \"Universal, Warner Brothers, and Sony also run major record companies as well.\" Therefore, the answer is Sony. \nThe answer: Sony", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 12}\nExplanation: These rules help us identify that the passage mentions both surf and skateboard culture, as well as yachting culture, in southern California. \nThe answer: skateboard and yachting culture", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Tony Hawk", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule about profession being a different concept from nationality (rule 4) helps us identify that the question is asking for a person's name, and the rule about gendered pronouns (rule 20) tells us that the person is male.\nThe answer: Shaun White", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A is relevant because the question asks for the island that is more famous for surf breaks than Southern California. Therefore, the answer is Oahu. \nThe answer: Oahu", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Transpac", "{rule list: names and locations are equally important}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a specific location, which falls under the rule that names and locations are equally important.\nThe answer: Palm Springs", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that many people visit the southern California coast for its popular beaches, which is a different concept than the nearby desert city of Palm Springs. Animals and vehicles are also different concepts and not relevant to the question.\nThe answer: popular beaches", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: Palm Springs is a city in California, so its location within the state is relevant. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that location and state are also different concepts. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored. \nThe answer: Southern California", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Palm Springs is popular for its nearby open spaces, in addition to its resort feel. We can ignore the mention of beaches as it is not relevant to the question.\nThe answer: nearby open spaces", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the midway point is located at 37\u00b0 9' 58.23\" latitude. \nThe answer: 37\u00b0 9' 58.23\" latitude", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the north-south midway point of California is located at exactly 37\u00b0 9' 58.23\" latitude, around 11 miles (18 km) south of San Jose. \nThe answer: 11 miles", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it helps us understand that \"southern-most counties\" refers to the counties located at the southern end of the state. Therefore, the answer is: ten.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is asking for a landmark that is used as the northern boundary in the other definition of southern California. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can use the antonym of \"other than\" to rephrase the question as \"What landmark is used in addition to Point Conception as the northern boundary in the other definition of southern California?\" The answer is \"the Tehachapi Mountains.\" \nThe answer: the Tehachapi Mountains.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a landmark that defines a boundary of southern California. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and the passage provides two possible definitions of southern California's boundary based on geographic features. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Using these rules, we can determine that Point Conception is a landmark that defines the northern boundary of southern California. \nThe answer: northern boundary", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Mexico", "{3, 10, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that we need to pay attention to the location of Los Angeles in the context. The rule that \"typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer\" means that we can ignore any typos in the question. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" means that \"lower part\" refers to the southern part of California. \nThe answer: southern California", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Monterey", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a piece of legislation, which falls under the category of profession and nationality being different concepts (rule 4). The passage mentions the Compromise of 1850, which is a specific event in history and therefore falls under the category of age being a different concept (rule 3). Finally, the passage mentions that the Compromise of 1850 prevented southern California from becoming its own separate slave state, indicating that the legislation was related to the issue of slavery, which is a political issue and falls under the category of profession and nationality being different concepts (rule 4) and first comes before last and last comes after first (rule 16).\nThe answer: Compromise of 1850", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the type of state that California was admitted to the Union as. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that California was admitted as a state is not relevant to the question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and the question specifically asks for the type of state that California was admitted as, implying that it was not a slave state. Therefore, the answer is: a free state.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"inequitable taxes\" in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative language in the passage. \nThe answer: pro-slavery southerners", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the region where pro-slavery southerners lived. Rule 3 and 4 indicate that concepts such as age, color, profession, and nationality are different and cannot be confused. Rule 7 indicates that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means that we can look for synonyms of \"pro-slavery southerners\" in the passage. Rule 13 indicates that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: \"Cow Counties\"", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that \"inequitable taxes and land laws\" are not relevant to the answer. We use rule 16 to determine that \"the 1850s\" comes before \"the Pico Act of 1859\". \nThe answer: three times", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: nearly 75%", "{rule list: 4, 13, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a Senator who was a strong advocate for the Pico Act. Therefore, we need to focus on identifying the name of the Senator and his role in relation to the Pico Act. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the Senator's nationality. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the Senator. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we need to look for the Senator's first and last name. Finally, Rule 20 tells us that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can assume that the Senator is male. \nThe answer: Milton Latham.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the newspaper that defined southern California, which is a concept. Therefore, we apply rule 3 to ensure that we don't confuse concepts. We also apply rule 13 to ensure that we pay attention to names. \nThe answer: Los Angeles Times", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The Los Angeles Times defined southern California in 1900.\nThe answer: 1900", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The Los Angeles Times originally defined southern California as including seven counties, but in 1999, they added a newer county, Imperial, to that list. Therefore, the change in definition occurred after the original definition, which was in 1900. \nThe answer: 1999", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Los Angeles Times added a newer county to the list in 1999. Therefore, the answer is Imperial.\nThe answer: Imperial", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the seven counties of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura and Santa Barbara\" were initially defined as southern California. Therefore, the answer is 7. \nThe answer: 7", "{rule list: 4, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the state is divided and promoted by its regional tourism groups, as well as by the two AAA Auto Clubs of the state. These organizations are the most relevant to the question and are mentioned specifically in the passage. Gender and nationality are not relevant concepts in this question.\nThe answer: regional tourism groups and the two AAA Auto Clubs of the state", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"the two AAA Auto Clubs of the state, the California State Automobile Association and the Automobile Club of Southern California, choose to simplify matters by dividing the state along the lines where their jurisdictions for membership apply, as either northern or southern California.\" This means that the California State Automobile Association also chose to simplify the divide.\nThe answer: California State Automobile Association", "{2, 3}\nExplanation: The article discusses how the state of California is divided into different regions, with some groups dividing it into northern, central, and southern regions, while the two AAA Auto Clubs divide it into just northern and southern regions. The question asks for the point of view that the AAA clubs are opposed to, which is the three-region point of view. Additionally, rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, which is relevant because the different ways of dividing California are based on different geographical and administrative factors, not just its physical size or shape.\nThe answer: three-region", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article discusses different ways of dividing California into regions, including the geographical phrase \"South of the Tehachapis.\" Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) applies. The question asks which mountain range influenced the split of the regions, so rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) applies. \nThe answer: Tehachapis", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it clarifies that the desert portions of north Los Angeles County are being included in the southern California region based on their geographical location, not their size or shape. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because it helps us understand that if the desert portions of north Los Angeles County are being included in the southern California region, then the central valley and interior desert landscape must be considered the opposite of southern California. \nThe answer: Southern California", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Southern California is the third most populated megalopolis in the United States, after the Great Lakes Megalopolis and the Northeastern megalopolis. Therefore, we can use rule 1 to infer that all other megalopolises in the US are less populated than Southern California. We can also use rule 16 to determine that the answer should be \"third most populated\" rather than a specific number.\nThe answer: third most populated", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Southern California consists of both heavily developed urban areas and vast areas that have been left undeveloped. The question asks for the amount of undeveloped land, implying a comparison to the developed land. Therefore, rule 3 applies to differentiate between the concepts of size and development. Rule 8 applies to invert the comparison between developed and undeveloped land. \nThe answer: vast areas", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, and color are different concepts applies here, as the question is asking for another characteristic besides being large and spread-out. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B also applies, as the question is asking for another characteristic, implying that being large and spread-out is already a characteristic. \nThe answer: suburban", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that southern California is famous for its large, spread-out, suburban communities. This implies that the region is known for its suburban development. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as size and shape, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 12 is relevant because it allows us to ignore irrelevant passages in the context. \nThe answer: suburban development", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The rules selected ensure that we understand that \"region\" refers to a geographic area and not a cultural or political entity. The answer is: metropolitan region.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the main gap to continued urbanization is Camp Pendleton. This is a specific location that is preventing further urban development. \nThe answer: Camp Pendleton", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for another area that the communities along Interstates 15 and 215 are connected with, implying that they are already connected with the San Diego metropolitan area. Therefore, rule 8 applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the San Diego metropolitan area is more connected to the communities along Interstates 15 and 215 than any other area, so any other area would be less connected. Rule 3 also applies, as the question asks for a different concept (area) than the ones listed in the passage (cities, communities, metropolitan areas). Finally, rule 4 applies to clarify that the question is not asking for a nationality or profession. \nThe answer: There is no other area mentioned in the passage that the communities along Interstates 15 and 215 are connected with, other than the San Diego metropolitan area.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The United States Census Bureau considers the San Bernardino and Riverside County areas to be a separate metropolitan area from Los Angeles County.\nThe answer: The United States Census Bureau", "{3, 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the county that people commute to other than L.A. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of nationality. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore any details about specific areas that experienced population growth. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the use of \"other than\" in the question. \nThe answer: Orange County", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"most of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties (the non-desert portions) were developed in the 1980s and 1990s.\" Therefore, the answer is the 1990s.\nThe answer: 1990s", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes southern California as having a Mediterranean climate, with hot and dry summers and mild and wet winters. The passage also notes that snow is rare in the Southwest of the state. \nThe answer: Mediterranean", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant here. The question asks for a characteristic other than \"many sunny days\" that is typical for the climate in southern California. \"Infrequent rain\" is a characteristic that is opposite to \"many sunny days\" and is therefore a valid answer. \nThe answer: infrequent rain", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the low end of the temperature range in summer, which is a concept of temperature. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the high end of the temperature range is in the 90s, the low end must be in the 60s. \nThe answer: 60s", "{rule list: 3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Snow is mentioned as being \"very rare\" in the Southwest of the state, which is a negation. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that snow is rare is not related to any of those concepts. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so any misspellings or errors in the question do not affect the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that snow is \"very rare\" is crucial to the answer.\nThe answer: Snow is very rare.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the high end of the temperature range in winter. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about those is irrelevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if summers are hot and dry, then winters are not hot and dry. Therefore, the high end of the temperature range in winter is in the 70s. \nThe answer: 70s", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the various landscapes in Southern California, starting from Pacific Ocean islands. The passage does not mention any professions, nationalities, animals, or vehicles, and there are no comparisons or negations to consider. The answer is: Pacific Ocean.", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage describes the varied collection of geologic, topographic, and natural ecosystem landscapes in southern California, indicating that the term that best describes this collection is \"varied.\" \nThe answer: varied", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Southern California consists of \"geologic, topographic, and natural ecosystem landscapes,\" indicating that these are the types of landscapes present in the region. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates those as possible types of landscapes. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates those as well. Therefore, the answer is that no other types of landscapes are mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: None mentioned.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the region spans from \"peaks\" of the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges implies that these are not the only mountains in the region. Therefore, we need to apply rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"Transverse and Peninsular Ranges\" are more specific than \"mountains,\" so \"mountains\" are less specific than \"Transverse and Peninsular Ranges.\" Thus, the answer is: None, the article only mentions the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Southern California region as consisting of various landscapes, including mountain ranges. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can't assume that the mountain ranges have a specific shape or size. However, rule 16 states that \"last comes after first,\" so we can assume that the mountain ranges are located at the end of the region and tail off into another formation. The answer is: deserts.", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that southern California has about 10,000 earthquakes each year. \nThe answer: 10,000", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: The passage states that nearly all of the earthquakes in southern California are so small that they are not felt, and only several hundred are greater than magnitude 3.0, with only about 15-20 greater than magnitude 4.0. Therefore, generally speaking, the earthquakes that hit southern California are small, with only a few being of moderate size. \nThe answer: small", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The magnitude 6.7 1994 Northridge earthquake was particularly destructive.\" This means that the Northridge earthquake had a magnitude of 6.7.\nThe answer: 6.7", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the 1994 Northridge earthquake caused the most property damage of any earthquake in U.S. history.\nThe answer: property damage", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the 1994 Northridge earthquake caused the most property damage of any earthquake in U.S. history, estimated at over $20 billion. This is a direct answer to the question.\nThe answer: over $20 billion", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the article states that the San Andreas Fault can produce a magnitude 8.0 event, which is higher than the other faults mentioned. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" applies because magnitude refers to the size or strength of an earthquake, which is a different concept than the shape, age, or color of a fault. \nThe answer: San Andreas Fault", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that many faults can produce a magnitude 6.7+ earthquake, which means that any fault that can produce a magnitude 6.7+ earthquake is less than or equal to many faults. Rule 2 applies because the article states that the San Andreas Fault can produce a magnitude 8.0 event, which is very high compared to other faults. Therefore, the answer is \"magnitude 6.7+\".", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific magnitudes of earthquakes produced by each fault are not relevant. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so faults are not vehicles and should not be treated as such. The question asks for \"one other fault\" besides the San Jacinto and Elsinore faults, so the first and last faults mentioned in the passage are not relevant. \nThe answer: Puente Hills Fault", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the organization that released a California Earthquake forecast. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the organization is related to earthquakes and is located in California is not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name of the organization in the text. \nThe answer: USGS", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that there are multiple faults in California that can produce earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 or higher, including the San Andreas Fault, San Jacinto Fault, Puente Hills Fault, and Elsinore Fault Zone. Therefore, the answer is that the earthquake forecast models the occurrence of earthquakes in California. \nThe answer: occurrence", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that Southern California's distinctive regions are divided culturally and politically, but there is no mention of any other trait. \nThe answer: There is no other trait mentioned.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that some cities in Southern California have \"sometimes global recognition.\" This implies that some cities in the region are recognized on a global scale. \nThe answer: global recognition", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer could be a specific profession. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates those possibilities as well. The answer must be related to economic activity, which is not a profession or a physical characteristic. Therefore, the answer is: economic activity.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year in which the population of southern California was recorded. The passage provides the information that the population was recorded in the 2010 United States Census. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the absence of negations in the question. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"southern California has a population of 22,680,010\" is in the active voice, so we can infer that the population was recorded in the 2010 census. \nThe answer: 2010", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Southern California has a reputation for high growth rates.\nThe answer: high growth rates.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the growth rate, which is a numerical concept. Therefore, rule 3 applies. The question also asks for the state average, which implies a comparison between different regions. Therefore, rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: 10.0%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: \"kind of economy\" implies a comparison between the economies of northern and southern California, which falls under rule 3. The question also asks for a specific type of economy, which falls under rule 8. \nThe answer: tech-oriented economy", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because it compares the growth rate of southern California to that of the northern part of the state. The rule 8 applies because the question asks for the region that began to grow, which implies that it was not growing before. The rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"assert,\" which implies a change in the region's status. \nThe answer: Greater Sacramento region", "{3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The article lists that Southern California consists of \"eight Metropolitan Statistical Areas.\" \nThe answer: Metropolitan Statistical Areas", "{3, 6, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), 6 (animals and vehicles are different concepts), 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer), and 13 (names are equally important for the answer). The answer can be found in the passage: \"The region is home to two extended metropolitan areas that exceed five million in population.\" \nThe answer: 2", "{3, 6, 10, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the population number for two extended metropolitan areas in Southern California. Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept from others, so we can focus on the population numbers. Rule 6 reminds us that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about them. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore any minor errors. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the names of the metropolitan areas. \nThe answer: 17,786,419 and 5,105,768.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The El Centro metropolitan area and San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos metropolitan area form the Southern Border Region.\nThe answer: Southern Border Region.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article provides a list of metropolitan areas in Southern California, including the Greater Los Angeles Area. The population of this area is explicitly stated as 17,786,419.\nThe answer: 17,786,419", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Los Angeles is the largest city in all of California with a population of 3.7 million people. San Diego is the second largest with a population of 1.3 million people. \nThe answer: Los Angeles", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept from other concepts means that we can't assume that the largest city is the answer. The rule that first comes before last means that we know that San Diego is the second largest city after Los Angeles.\nThe answer: 1.3 million people", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are \"twelve cities with more than 200,000 residents\" in southern California. The number 12 is a direct answer to the question. \nThe answer: 12", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are \"34 cities over 100,000 in population\" in southern California. \nThe answer: 100,000", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that we need to pay attention to the specific cities mentioned in the article. The rule that \"size\" is a different concept from \"location\" means that we can ignore the population sizes of the cities mentioned. The answer: Riverside.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"materials\" and \"resources\" are different concepts applies here. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" also applies, as the passage states that Southern California's economy is heavily dependent on petroleum. \nThe answer: petroleum", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Southern California is famous for tourism and Hollywood, which is a notably named district known for its film, television, and music industries. \nThe answer: Hollywood", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific event that occurred in Southern California between 2001-2007. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can infer that the event was not a positive one. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we can infer that the event was not a success. \nThe answer: the housing bubble", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Southern California's economy is described as \"dominated and heavily dependent upon abundance of petroleum\" compared to other regions where automobiles are not as dominant. This indicates that the region's economy is heavily reliant on the petroleum industry. Rule 4 applies as profession and industry are different concepts, and rule 8 applies as \"heavily dependent\" is a comparison of degree. \nThe answer: heavily reliant on the petroleum industry", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the region \"has been heavily impacted by the housing crash.\" This is a clear indication that the housing crash had a negative effect on the region.\nThe answer: It had a negative impact on the region.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that these industries have been major since the 1920s, which is a specific decade. Additionally, the sentence structure implies that this is the earliest time period mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: 1920s", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the region was one of the richest agricultural regions in the U.S. \nThe answer: rich", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: Livestock, citrus, and agriculture are different concepts. Therefore, the answer cannot be livestock. The passage mentions that the region is one of the richest agricultural regions in the U.S. and that farmlands were turned into suburbs. This implies that agriculture was a major industry in the region. Therefore, the answer is agriculture.\nThe answer: Agriculture", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the region was known for cattle, which is a type of livestock.\nThe answer: cattle", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that industries and professions are different concepts (rule 4), and that industries are different from size, shape, age, and color (rule 3). The passage mentions that motion pictures, petroleum, aircraft manufacturing, cattle, and citrus were major industries, but farmlands were turned into suburbs (rule 5). The passage also mentions that military spending cutbacks have had an impact, but aerospace continues to be a major factor (rule 6). Therefore, the answer is aerospace. \nThe answer: aerospace", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"business districts\" in Southern California, which is a type of location. The passage also lists specific examples of central business districts. \nThe answer: business districts", "{3}\nExplanation: CBD stands for Central Business District.\nThe answer: Central Business District.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the district in the CBD that does not have \"downtown\" in its name. Rule 3 states that shape and location are different concepts, so the fact that the other districts have \"downtown\" in their names is irrelevant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the district in question is South Coast Metro, as it is the only one listed in the middle of the sentence. \nThe answer: South Coast Metro", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Downtown Burbank is a business district, which falls under the concept of profession. Therefore, rule 4 applies. It is also described as \"Downtown,\" which implies that it is a central area of the city, falling under the concept of location. Therefore, rule 3 applies.\nThe answer: a business district", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Downtown Santa Monica and Downtown Glendale are part of the Los Angeles Area.\nThe answer: Los Angeles Area", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Warner Center is listed as one of the business districts lining Wilshire Boulevard Miracle Mile, which is located in the San Fernando Valley. Therefore, the answer is San Fernando Valley. \nThe answer: San Fernando Valley", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Century City belongs to Los Angeles, which is mentioned as having business districts lining Wilshire Boulevard, including Century City.\nThe answer: Los Angeles", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes three business districts in the San Bernardino-Riverside area: Downtown San Bernardino, Hospitality Business/Financial Centre, and University Town. \nThe answer: business district", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the San Bernardino-Riverside area maintains three business districts: Downtown San Bernardino, Hospitality Business/Financial Centre (which is in San Bernardino), and University Town. Therefore, the answer is Riverside. \nThe answer: Riverside", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 4, which states that locations are equally important for the answer, and rule 12, which states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. The answer can be found in the passage and is \"Hospitality Business/Financial Centre\" in San Bernardino and \"Downtown Riverside.\" \nThe answer: Hospitality Business/Financial Centre", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the county that is developing its business center, which is Orange County. The answer is straightforward and can be found in the first sentence of the article. Rule 3 applies to ensure that size and location are not confused, and rule 13 applies to ensure that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Orange County", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being \"Irvine\" or \"California.\" The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that \"international corporations\" are headquartered at the \"University of California, Irvine.\"\nThe answer: University of California, Irvine", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: Jamboree Business Parks is listed as part of the West Irvine business center in the article, which is mentioned after the Irvine Spectrum business center. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored. \nThe answer: West Irvine", "{rule list: profession and location are different concepts, names and locations are equally important}\nExplanation: The question asks for another business district in Orange County besides Downtown Santa Ana and Newport Center. The passage mentions several other business centers, including South Coast Metro, Irvine Spectrum, West Irvine, and the University of California, Irvine. However, the question specifically asks for a \"district,\" and only West Irvine is referred to as a district in the passage. Therefore, the answer is West Irvine. \nThe answer: West Irvine", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Orange County is a rapidly developing business center.\nThe answer: Rapidly", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Downtown San Diego is the central business district of San Diego.\" This is a clear and concise answer to the question.\nThe answer: Downtown San Diego.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" tells us that the answer must specify the locations of the business districts. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" tells us that the answer must not include any professions or nationalities. \nThe answer: Northern San Diego and North County regions.", "{3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"most of these districts are located in Northern San Diego and some within North County regions.\" This means that there are business districts outside of Northern San Diego in the North County regions. \nThe answer: North County regions", "{rule list: 13, 14}\nExplanation: University City is a business district located in a city mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: San Diego", "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21\nExplanation: We need to identify the airport that is the second busiest in the United States. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more busy than B, then B is less busy than A. Rule 2 tells us that if A is busy and B is very/somewhat busy, then A is the busiest and B is the least/most busy. Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept from other characteristics. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 5 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Rule 6 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more busy than B, then B is more antonym(busy) than A. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. Rule ", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The article mentions passenger volume and international passenger volume as metrics for determining how busy airports are.\nThe answer: passenger volume and international passenger volume", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the ranking of Los Angeles International Airport in terms of international passenger volume. Rule 3 states that size and quantity are different concepts, so we cannot assume that being second-busiest in terms of passenger volume automatically means second-busiest in terms of international passenger volume. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if LAX is third in terms of international passenger volume, we can infer that it is not second. \nThe answer: third", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article lists several airports in Southern California, but only one of them is described as the \"busiest single runway airport in the world.\" This information is a direct answer to the question.\nThe answer: San Diego International Airport", "{3, 5, 12}\nExplanation: The article lists several airports in Southern California, including Van Nuys Airport, which is described as the \"world's busiest general aviation airport.\" \nThe answer: Van Nuys Airport", "{rule list: 13, 14}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Six of the seven lines of the commuter rail system, Metrolink, run out of Downtown Los Angeles...\".\nThe answer: Metrolink", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explicitly states that there are seven lines in the Metrolink system, with six running out of Downtown Los Angeles and one connecting San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange counties directly.\nThe answer: 7", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Six of the seven lines of the commuter rail system, Metrolink, run out of Downtown Los Angeles,\" indicating that there are six lines that run out of Downtown LA. \nThe answer: 6", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the other line\" connects San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange counties directly, implying that the first six lines do not. Therefore, the answer is Orange county.\nThe answer: Orange county", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Southern California is home to the Port of Los Angeles, which is the United States' busiest commercial port.\nThe answer: Port of Los Angeles", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that we need to pay attention to the specific locations mentioned in the article. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" means that we can determine that the Port of Long Beach is the second busiest container port in the United States, since it is listed after the Port of Los Angeles. \nThe answer: Port of Long Beach", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Port of Long Beach is adjacent to the Port of Los Angeles, which is located in Southern California. Therefore, the Port of Long Beach also belongs to Southern California.\nThe answer: Southern California", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The moniker being used to describe the region's diversified technology is \"The Tech Coast.\"\nThe answer: The Tech Coast", "{3, 4, 12, 13, 19}\nExplanation: The rules selected ensure that we focus on the concept of universities in the region and avoid confusion with other concepts. Rule 3 ensures that we don't confuse the type of universities with their location or size. Rule 4 ensures that we don't confuse the type of universities with their affiliation or nationality. Rule 12 ensures that we don't get sidetracked by irrelevant information. Rule 13 ensures that we focus on the importance of names. Rule 19 ensures that we don't make assumptions about the gender of the universities. \nThe answer: prestigious and world-renowned research universities and other public and private institutions.", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the question is not asking about the nationality of the California Institute of Technology. The rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so the question is not asking about the gender of the California Institute of Technology.\nThe answer: private institution", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the number of University of California campuses mentioned in the article. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore any irrelevant information about the campuses. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about private institutions. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the first and last mentions of University of California campuses. \nThe answer: 5.", "{3, 4, 6, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of campuses is not related to any of these. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the universities are in California does not help answer the question. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the fact that universities are institutions does not help answer the question. First comes before last and last comes after first, so the order in which the universities are listed can be used to count them.\nThe answer: 12", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the profession of the Los Angeles Rams is not relevant to their classification as a sports team. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the Los Angeles Rams are the first team listed under the NFL category.\nThe answer: NFL", "{rule list: 4, 5}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the sport that the Los Angeles Clippers team belongs to. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the team is from Los Angeles does not help answer the question. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the fact that the other teams listed are from different sports does not help answer the question. \nThe answer: NBA", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts}\nExplanation: The rule states that profession and nationality are different concepts, meaning that the team's name (nationality) and the sport (profession) are not interchangeable. \nThe answer: MLB", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts eliminates any possibility of the answer being another animal team. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts eliminates any possibility of the answer being a team from a different country. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts eliminates any possibility of the answer being a team with a different name but similar characteristics. \nThe answer: Los Angeles Kings", "{4, 12}\nExplanation: The question asks for the MLS team in Southern California, which is a profession. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can focus on the fact that the question is asking for a profession. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the other teams listed. \nThe answer: LA Galaxy", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Chivas were suspended following the 2014 MLS season.\" This means that Chivas USA was the team that was suspended.\nThe answer: Chivas USA", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that from 2005 to 2014, there were two Major League Soccer teams in Los Angeles. \nThe answer: Two", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: We need to find the year when one of the two soccer teams was suspended. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more recent than B, then B is less recent than A. Therefore, we can use the fact that Chivas USA was suspended following the 2014 MLS season to answer the question. Rule 16 tells us that we should output the year as the answer. \nThe answer: 2014", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that both teams played at the StubHub Center.\nThe answer: StubHub Center", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The passage states that a second MLS team is scheduled to return in 2018, implying that the previously suspended team will be returning in that year. \nThe answer: 2018", "{rule list: 4, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions college sports being popular in southern California, specifically mentioning the UCLA Bruins and USC Trojans. The question asks for another kind of sport, implying that college sports are not the only popular type. Therefore, rules 4 and 5 apply, indicating that animals and vehicles are different concepts and that sports and college affiliation are different concepts. \nThe answer: It is not specified in the article.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the Bruins is not relevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that \"the Bruins\" refers to a team belonging to a college. \nThe answer: UCLA", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts, names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a sports team, which is a different concept from profession or nationality. The question also specifies that the team is from USC, which is a name. \nThe answer: USC Trojans", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the conference that the UCLA Bruins and USC Trojans play in. This is a factual question that does not involve any comparisons or relationships between concepts. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are the most relevant. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not applicable here. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is also not applicable here. The answer is Pac-12 Conference.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" The first team listed is the UCLA Bruins and the last team listed is the USC Trojans. Therefore, the answer is the Pac-12 Conference. \nThe answer: Pac-12 Conference", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that rugby is a growing sport in southern California.\nThe answer: rugby", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that rugby is becoming more popular as an official school sport. This implies that it is at the high school level.\nThe answer: high school", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that rugby is becoming an official school sport at increasing numbers of high schools in southern California. This indicates that rugby is rapidly becoming a popular/high school sport in the region.\nThe answer: a popular/high school sport", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting are the two companies being referred to in the sentence. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence is in the active voice and that the subject (the company being formed) is BSkyB. \nThe answer: BSkyB", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that BSkyB (now known as Sky plc) is the UK's largest digital subscription television company.\nThe answer: Sky plc", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year in which BSkyB acquired Sky Italia. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more recent than B, then B is less recent than A. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Therefore, we can infer that the acquisition of Sky Italia happened after the merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting in November 1990. The answer is 2014. \n\nThe answer: 2014.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we can infer that BSkyB is the subsidiary of the holding company, and that the holding company's name is British Sky Broadcasting Group plc. \nThe answer: British Sky Broadcasting Group plc", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: We need to identify the name of the United Kingdom operation for BSkyB. Rule 3 tells us that color, shape, age, and size are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of nationality. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the details about the company's acquisition of other companies. \nThe answer: Sky UK Limited", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2006", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: two", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that we can distinguish between different broadcasters.

Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that ONdigital is not a profession. Therefore, we can use rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, BSkyB was excluded from ONdigital, so we can say that ONdigital was more exclusive than BSkyB. Therefore, BSkyB teamed up with ITV Digital's free-to-air replacement, Freeview. \nThe answer: ITV Digital", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service, but this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005. Therefore, prior to October 2005, only one BSkyB channel, Sky Travel, was available to customers.\nThe answer: one", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sky Three", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that Sky Travel was initially provided to the Freeview service, but was later replaced by Sky Three, which was then rebranded as 'Pick TV' in 2011. \nThe answer: 'Pick TV'", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: BSkyB charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky+ PVR with their service.\nThe answer: Sky+ PVR", "{rule list: 7, 10, 12, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific date or time period, but the article does not provide one. Therefore, we must use rules 7 (synonyms), 10 (typos), 12 (irrelevant passages), 16 (order of events), and 17 (negations) to determine that the article only provides the month and year of the advertising campaign, which is September 2007.\nThe answer: September 2007", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if customers do not subscribe to BSkyB's channels, they must pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions. \nThe answer: paying a monthly fee", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box in January 2010. This is a straightforward question that only requires understanding the timeline of events mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: January 2010", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The article states that in January 2010, BSkyB discontinued the Sky+ Box and started issuing the Sky+HD Box as standard, giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+. \nThe answer: Sky+HD Box", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that BSkyB uses the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS, a Cisco Systems company.\nThe answer: VideoGuard", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question.

Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can infer that if BSkyB's new deal included HD channels and Video On Demand content that was not previously carried by cable, then the basic channels that were removed must not have included those features. \nThe answer: basic channels", "{rule list: typos in the question are irrelevant, focus on dates}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year, so we need to focus on finding a date in the article. The answer is \"2007\". \nThe answer: 2007", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what BSkyB did, which was to increase the asking price for the channels. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for what Virgin Media claimed, which may not necessarily be true. \nThe answer: Virgin Media claimed that BSkyB substantially increased the asking price for the channels.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for an additional service that BSkyB offered besides HD channels, which they claimed offered \"substantially more value\". Therefore, we can infer that the additional service is not related to the size, shape, age, or color of the channels, and that BSkyB believed it offered more value than just HD channels. The answer is Video On Demand content.", "{2, 3, 4}\nExplanation: BSkyB offered HD channels in addition to Video On Demand, which was not previously carried by cable. This falls under rule 2 as HD channels are a more valuable addition to the package, and rule 3 as it is a different concept from Video On Demand. The answer is HD channels.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time, which can be found in the article as \"In July 2013\".

Rule 2 applies because \"rename\" is a synonym for \"change the name of\". Rule 12 applies because the passage contains information about the settlement and the renaming of the service, but the specific details of the settlement are not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the new name, which comes after the old name. \nThe answer: OneDrive", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: OneDrive for Business", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that SkyDrive is a cloud storage service, which falls under the concept of technology rather than profession or nationality.\nThe answer: cloud storage", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer, Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch.

However, the mention of the company's business strategy and the launch of new channels suggests that the answer may be related to the company itself. Negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for the owner of the satellites, not who the satellites belong to. The answer: Astra.", "{3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so any information about Michael Grade's criticism is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the date of the end of the analogue service as September 27, 2001. \nThe answer: September 27, 2001.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sky Digital platform", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 3.5 million", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that Sky UK Limited was formerly known as British Sky Broadcasting or BSkyB.\nThe answer: British Sky Broadcasting or BSkyB", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that Sky UK Limited is a telecommunications company that provides television, broadband internet, and fixed line telephone services to consumers and businesses in the United Kingdom. This falls under the concept of profession, as a company's type of business is considered its profession. Therefore, rule 4 applies to clarify that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 3 also applies to clarify that the concepts of size, shape, age, and color are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: telecommunications company", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and the passage provides a specific number for the customers. The irrelevant information about its popularity and headquarters can be ignored.\nThe answer: 11 million customers", "{2, 4, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the digital TV service that overtook Sky UK Limited as the UK's most popular. Rule 2 applies because \"overtaken\" implies a comparison between two entities. Rule 4 applies because we need to distinguish between the company (Sky UK Limited) and the service (digital TV). Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"what other\") which indicates that we are looking for a service that is not Sky UK Limited. \nThe answer: Freeview", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Sky Q range consists of a broadband router called the Sky Q Hub. It also states that this is one of the products in the range, which is relevant to rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and rule 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer).\nThe answer: Sky Q Hub", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts is not relevant to this question. Rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, is also not relevant. The answer to the question is found in the passage that states \"The Sky Q Mini set top boxes connect to the Sky Q Silver set top boxes with a Wi-Fi or Power-line connection rather than receive their own satellite feeds.\" This means that the Sky Q mini set top boxes are able to connect to the Sky Q Silver set top boxes. \nThe answer: Sky Q Silver set top boxes", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The Sky Q Mini set top boxes connect to the Sky Q Silver set top boxes with a Wi-Fi or Power-line connection rather than receive their own satellite feeds. This allows all set top boxes in a household to share recordings and other media.\nThe answer: Share recordings and other media.", "{rule list: 23, 16}\nExplanation: UHD broadcasts will be introduced later in 2016, which means it will happen after the announcement on November 18, 2015.\nThe answer: later in 2016", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that the Sky Q products and services will be available in 2016. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a specific time frame. Rule 22 is relevant because it clarifies that \"range of products and services\" refers to the Sky Q set top boxes, broadband router, and mobile applications. \nThe answer: 2016", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks about what BSkyB's standard definition broadcasts are compliant with, so we need to find the opposite of compliant. The answer is that BSkyB's standard definition broadcasts are compliant with the DVB-compliant MPEG-2 standard.\nThe answer: DVB-compliant MPEG-2", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify what optional soundtracks are included in Sky Movies and Sky Box Office channels. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse concepts, so we need to focus on the channels mentioned in the question. Rule 8 tells us that if A has X and B has less X than A, then B has more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, we can infer that channels other than Sky Movies and Sky Box Office do not include optional Dolby Digital soundtracks. \nThe answer: Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard.\nThe answer: MPEG-4", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates any potential confusion between the terms \"Sky\" and \"Sky+HD\" as they are not the same type of entity. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: OpenTV system", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it distinguishes between different aspects of the broadcast, such as the format and the standard used. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is not relevant. \nThe answer: DVB-S2 standard", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that Sky Digital was launched in 1998.\nThe answer: 1998", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Astra 2A", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Astra 2A satellite", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: hundreds", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the old analogue service was broadcast from 19.2\u00b0E, while the new digital service used the Astra 2A satellite located at 28.5\u00b0E, which came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom.\nThe answer: 28.5\u00b0E", "{rule list: 10, 11, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Contractions and typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, and some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer.

The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" to the word \"sport\" in the context paragraph. \nThe answer: English Premier League Football", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the broadcasts are free-to-air and encrypted means that they are both unencrypted and not requiring a subscription. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the broadcasts are free-to-air encrypted, then they are also not requiring a subscription. \nThe answer: free-to-air and unencrypted", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"require\". The answer is: a VideoGuard UK equipped receiver.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, profession and nationality are different concepts, and negations are important for the answer. The question asks what a receiver needs to be equipped with to view encrypted content, which implies that encrypted content cannot be viewed without a specific equipment. Therefore, the answer is: a VideoGuard UK equipped receiver.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that a universal Ku band LNB (9.75/10.600 GHz) is used to receive free-to-air channels. This means that the answer is \"Ku band\". \nThe answer: Ku band", "{3, 4, 5, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so they are not relevant.

Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches.\nThe answer: the BBC", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"BSkyB paying \u00a3304m for the Premier League rights\" which means that BSkyB was going to pay \u00a3304m.\nThe answer: \u00a3304m", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: BSkyB has an operating license from Ofcom, as stated in the article. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that \"Ofcom\" is not a profession but rather a regulatory body. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the use of \"no veto\" and \"enforced\" in the passage. \nThe answer: Ofcom", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a range, which implies a comparison. The answer is \u00a315-100,000.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if BSkyB has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG, then it cannot be said that they have the power to veto it. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the concept of having a veto over the presence of channels on their EPG is different from the concept of having control over the channel's content or carriage issues. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"Can BSkyB veto...\") which is important for the answer. \nThe answer: No, BSkyB has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"BSkyB does not carry any control over the channel's content.\" This is a clear negation of control over a channel's content. \nThe answer: No, BSkyB does not carry any control over a channel's content.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that BSkyB does not have control over carriage issues such as picture quality. This means that they do not have control over the picture quality of a channel.\nThe answer: No", "{rule list: 2, 10}\nExplanation: The question asks for the date of the launch of BSkyB's digital service. Rule 2 applies because the article mentions that small-scale tests were carried out before the official launch on October 1, 1998. Rule 10 applies because the contraction \"BSkyB's\" is irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: October 1, 1998", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sky Digital", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of BSkyB's interactive service, which is a specific concept. Rule 3 states that concepts such as names are different from other concepts such as size or shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the interactive service was originally branded as Open, but is now called Sky Active. Therefore, the answer is Sky Active.\nThe answer: Sky Active", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can't assume that BSkyB competed with a specific nationality. However, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if BSkyB competed with ONdigital, then ONdigital competed with BSkyB. Therefore, the answer is ONdigital. \nThe answer: ONdigital", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of digiboxes sold within 30 days, which is a specific time frame. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"within\" which implies a range of time. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a comparison between the number of digiboxes sold within 30 days and some other number. \nThe answer: over 100,000", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the article's first sentence, which states that Virgin Media was re-branded from NTL:Telewest in 2007. Rule 16 applies because \"re-branded\" implies a change in name, and the first name listed is \"NTL:Telewest.\" Rule 23 applies because the sentence is in the active voice, with \"Virgin Media\" as the subject and \"re-branded\" as the verb. \nThe answer: 2007", "{rule list: 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that NTL:Telewest was re-branded to Virgin Media in 2007.\nThe answer: Virgin Media", "{rule list} 2, 3\nExplanation: The passage states that Virgin Media did not offer many linear HD channels, but instead focused on its Video On Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content.\nThe answer: its Video On Demand service", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the time period before and after the given dates. Rule 7 applies because the question contains a synonym for \"channel\" in \"linear\". Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation in \"only carried one\". \nThe answer: BBC HD", "{3, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the history of Virgin Media and its offerings, including its high-definition television (HDTV) set top box. The question asks for the name of another HD channel that Virgin Media could carry in the future. Relevant rules include 3 (different concepts), 7 (synonyms), 12 (irrelevant passages), and 13 (names are important). \nThe answer: Channel 4 HD", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 10 million homes.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: more than 25m people", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: August 2004", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 36%", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe were flattening", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that negations are important for the answer is relevant because the question asks what Alec Shelbrooke proposed payments of benefits to be made on, and the answer is a \"Welfare Cash Card\", which is a negation of payments being made in cash. \nThe answer: a \"Welfare Cash Card\"", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is mentioned as a comparison to the proposed Welfare Cash Card, which would only allow the purchase of \"essentials\". Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as food and non-food items, should not be confused. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for what can be purchased, not what cannot be purchased. \nThe answer: food/essential groceries.", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for what the UK parliament heard about a subscription to BSkyB. The passage states that a claim was made in parliament that a subscription to BSkyB was \"often damaging\", along with other items like alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. This is a negation, as it suggests that having a subscription to BSkyB could be seen as a negative thing. Therefore, rules 7 and 17 are relevant, as they deal with synonyms and negations. \nThe answer: often damaging", "{rule list: 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks what the UK government's benefits agency was checking in 2012. The relevant information is that they were checking claimants' \"Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone\". The word \"wrongly\" indicates a negation, which is important to the answer.\nThe answer: claimants' \"Sky TV bills\" to check if they were wrongly claiming to be living alone as a single mother.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: A man was present in the household.", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: The article states that the agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of \u00a330m for the channels.\nThe answer: \u00a330m", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Currently unknown/unclear", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Virgin Media", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that negations are important for the answer is relevant, as the question asks for the company that agreed to terminate high court proceedings with Virgin Media. The answer is both BSkyB and Virgin Media, as stated in the passage.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that both BSkyB and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels. This means that the high court proceedings were related to the carriage of basic channels.\nThe answer: carriage of basic channels", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage describes Victoria's economy as highly diversified, with service sectors and manufacturing being the majority of employment. Therefore, the answer is a service-based economy. \nThe answer: service-based", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the mention of Melbourne's cultural attractions and sporting events are irrelevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the mention of Victoria's universities is also irrelevant. First comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer is referring to Victoria's ranking in terms of gross state product. \nThe answer: second", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Victoria is ranked fourth in terms of GSP per capita because of its limited mining activity. This means that there are three other states in Australia with higher GSP per capita than Victoria. \nThe answer: fourth", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Melbourne is home to a number of museums, art galleries, and theaters and is also described as the \"sporting capital of Australia.\" \nThe answer: Melbourne", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the largest stadium in Australia.\nThe answer: the Melbourne Cricket Ground", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that many Chinese miners worked in Victoria, and their legacy is particularly strong in Bendigo and its environs.\nThe answer: Bendigo and its environs", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Lambing Flat riots are mentioned as an example of anti-Chinese violence, which is contrasted with the relatively lower level of such violence in Victoria. The question asks for the location of the riots, which is directly stated as \"in New South Wales.\" The irrelevant information about typhoid outbreak and living conditions can be ignored.\nThe answer: New South Wales", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us understand that the Buckland Valley is the location being referred to in the passage. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence is in the active voice, and therefore the riot occurred at Buckland Valley.\nThe answer: Buckland Valley", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: over 1,000", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes the conditions on the gold fields as cramped and unsanitary, and mentions an outbreak of typhoid that killed over 1,000 miners. The irrelevant information about racism and riots can be ignored.\nThe answer: cramped and unsanitary", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Victorian Legislative Council elections were held under a new multi-member proportional representation system. This means that multiple representatives are elected from each electorate based on the proportion of votes received. Additionally, the article mentions that the State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates with each electorate represented by five representatives elected by Single Transferable Vote. This is a type of proportional representation where voters rank candidates in order of preference. Therefore, the answer is: multi-member proportional representation.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates.\nThe answer: eight", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"each electorate [is] represented by five representatives.\" This means that each electorate has five representatives.\nThe answer: five", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the term of office for each house member is now the same as the lower house members, which is four years. This is a straightforward answer that can be found by applying rule 3 (age and time are different concepts) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first).\nThe answer: four years.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that elections for the Victorian Parliament are now fixed and occur in November every four years. This means that elections are held every four years. The relevant rules are 3 (age and time are different concepts) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). \nThe answer: every four years.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the strength of a political party and the location of its support base. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between political parties as a concept and their support base. \nThe answer: Australian Labor Party (ALP)", "{rule list: 2, 4}\nExplanation: The question asks for the political party that is strongest in Melbourne's affluent areas. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"affluent\" as a synonym for \"more affluent,\" which means that the party that is \"strongest\" in those areas is also the \"most\" supported by them. Rule 4 applies because political parties and geographical locations are different concepts. \nThe answer: the Liberal Party of Australia", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that political parties are not related to geographic regions, so we must use the rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts to determine that the question is asking about a geographic region. The answer is the National Party of Australia.", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Australian Greens are strongest in inner Melbourne. This means that they are the party that rules in Melbourne's inner regions.\nThe answer: Australian Greens", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that the Labor Party is traditionally strongest in the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo, and Geelong. \nThe answer: Labor Party", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: We can use rule 1 to infer that the percentage of Victorians who are not Christian is 100% - 61.1% = 38.9%. Therefore, the answer is 61.1%. \nThe answer: 61.1%", "{3, 4, 6}\nExplanation: The rule that religion is a different concept from nationality (4) allows us to identify that the question is asking about a religious group, not a nationality. The rule that different religions are different concepts (3) allows us to identify that the answer is referring to a specific religious group. Finally, the rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts (6) reminds us that we are dealing with people, not physical objects. \nThe answer: 26.7% of the Victorian population (or approximately 1 in 4 people) are Roman Catholic.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Buddhism", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that Buddhism is the state's largest non-Christian religion with 168,637 members as of the most recent census.\nThe answer: 168,637", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the number of people who claim no religion, which is a negation. Therefore, we apply rule 17. We also need to differentiate between religion and nationality, so we apply rule 3. Finally, we do not need to consider any specific professions or locations, so we do not need to apply any other rules. \nThe answer: around 20% of Victorians claim no religion.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Victoria is a state in the south-east of Australia.\nThe answer: south-east of Australia", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size and shape are different concepts means that population density is not related to the size of the state. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B means that if Victoria is Australia's most densely populated state, then it is not the least densely populated state. \nThe answer: Victoria is Australia's most densely populated state.", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"compared.\" Rule 3 applies because the question asks about population, which is a different concept than size, shape, age, or color.\nThe answer: Victoria is Australia's second-most populous state overall.", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The article states that the capital and largest city of Victoria is Melbourne.\nThe answer: Melbourne", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, so the size of Melbourne cannot be compared to other Australian cities. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we cannot compare the size of Melbourne to other Australian cities, we can say that Melbourne's size cannot be compared to other Australian cities. \nThe answer: Melbourne's size cannot be compared to other Australian cities.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the area now constituting Victoria was inhabited by a large number of Aboriginal peoples, collectively known as the Koori. Therefore, the answer is Koori.\nThe answer: Koori", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific date or time period, which is not provided in the article. However, the article does mention that Great Britain claimed the entire Australian continent east of the 135th meridian east in 1788. Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that this event occurred before the other events mentioned in the article. We can also use rule 17 to note that the question contains the word \"did\" which is a negation, so we need to provide the opposite of the negation. \nThe answer: Great Britain claimed Australia in 1788.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: New South Wales", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay.\" This means that the first settlement in Victoria was at Sullivan Bay.\nThe answer: Sullivan Bay", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay. This is the earliest mention of settlement in the article and is therefore the answer to the question.\nThe answer: 1803", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size and shape are different concepts means that the specific area of farmland used for grains is relevant to the answer. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B means that we can rephrase the question as \"What is the total area of Victorian farmland sown for grain?\" since \"how much\" can refer to either the area or the quantity produced. \nThe answer: More than 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 sq mi)", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states the percentage of farmland sown for wheat compared to other grains. Rule 2 applies because the article provides specific percentages for wheat, barley, oats, and hay. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific type of crop. \nThe answer: More than 50%", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) is sown for hay.\" \nThe answer: 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi)", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Victorian farms produce nearly 90% of Australian pears.\" This sentence provides a direct answer to the question without any need for further interpretation or inference.\nThe answer: nearly 90%", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Last year, 121,200 tonnes of pears and 270,000 tonnes of tomatoes were produced.\" \nThe answer: 270,000 tonnes", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Victoria has a written constitution enacted in 1975.\nThe answer: 1975", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Victoria's constitution is based on the 1855 colonial constitution passed by the UK Parliament. This means that the constitution is based on a historical document. The answer is: the 1855 colonial constitution.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Victorian Constitution can be amended by the Parliament of Victoria.\nThe answer: Parliament of Victoria", "3, 16, 17, 22\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. First comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the special considerations apply to certain provisions in the constitution. Negations are important for the answer, so we know that the provisions that require special considerations cannot be amended by the Parliament of Victoria alone. Finally, if two entities are listed, \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so we know that the provisions that require an absolute majority in both houses, a three-fifths majority in both houses, or the approval of the Victorian people in a referendum are the ones that require special considerations to amend.\nThe answer: certain \"entrenched\" provisions that require either an absolute majority in both houses, a three-fifths majority in both houses, or the approval of the Victorian people in a referendum, depending on the provision.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Parliament of Victoria was established by the Victoria Constitution Act 1855.

Therefore, the weather type of Mallee and upper Wimmera is hot. Additionally, rule 8 applies because the question asks for the weather type, which is the antonym of \"temperature.\" \nThe answer: hot", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is also not relevant. Rule 8, which states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A,\" is relevant because the question asks for what the average temperature exceeds in the summer. Therefore, the answer is 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F). \nThe answer: 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the average temperature in the region during winter is 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), so there is no information about how cold it gets. However, the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B applies here. Since the article mentions that the inland monthly temperatures are 2\u20137 \u00b0C (4\u201313 \u00b0F) warmer than around Melbourne, we can infer that the temperature in this region during winter is not very cold. \nThe answer: There is no information about how cold it gets, but it is not very cold.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions Victoria's highest maximum temperature, not monthly temperature. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that maximum temperature and monthly temperature are different concepts. Additionally, rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Since the question asks for the highest monthly temperature, we can infer that the answer is not the same as Victoria's highest maximum temperature. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the passage.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the highest maximum temperature in Victoria since World War II was recorded in Hopetoun on 7 February 2009, during the 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave. We can ignore the information about average temperatures and focus on the specific date mentioned in the question.\nThe answer: 2009", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Public schools in Victoria are schools that are funded and run directly by the Victoria Department of Education, and students do not pay tuition fees. This is in contrast to private fee-paying schools, which include parish schools run by the Roman Catholic Church and independent schools. The distinction between public and private schools is based on funding, which is a different concept from the type of school based on religious affiliation or ownership. The negation in the question (\"what are public schools\") is important to note, as it asks for a definition rather than a list of examples. \nThe answer: Schools that are funded and run directly by the Victoria Department of Education.", "{3, 4, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Public schools in Victoria are directly funded and run by the Victoria Department of Education, which is a government organization. Therefore, rules 3 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 4 (animals and vehicles are different concepts) do not apply. Rule 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer) is relevant because the passage mentions various types of schools in Victoria, but the question specifically asks about public schools. Rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant because the question asks about the first organization mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: Victoria Department of Education", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: Public schools in Victoria are funded directly by the government, so students do not pay tuition fees. However, some extra costs are levied, which could include things like textbooks, uniforms, and excursions. \nThe answer: extra costs", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: Private fee-paying schools in Victoria include parish schools run by the Roman Catholic Church and independent schools similar to British public schools. Independent schools are usually affiliated with Protestant churches.\nThe answer: Roman Catholic Church", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"All schools must comply with government-set curriculum standards.\" This means that all schools, both public and private, have to meet the standards set by the government for their curriculum.\nThe answer: government-set curriculum standards", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The rules ensure that we understand that \"manufacturing plant\" is a profession and not a vehicle or animal. The answer is: car manufacturing plants.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time when Toyota will close its Victoria plant. Rule 3 states that time is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"When will the Victoria plant of Toyota close?\" The answer is \"2017\". \nThe answer: 2017", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Holden's announcement occurred in May 2013,\" which means that the announcement was made in May of that year.\nThe answer: May 2013", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article states that \"Ford's Victorian plants\u2014in Broadmeadows and Geelong\u2014will close in October 2016,\" indicating that the Victorian plants are the last ones to close. Therefore, the answer is October 2016.\nThe answer: October 2016.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Ford's Victorian plants\u2014in Broadmeadows and Geelong\u2014will close in October 2016.\" This means that Ford is the brand of car manufactured in Broadmeadows.\nThe answer: Ford", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: almost 2,000 m (6,600 ft)", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Mount Bogong is the highest peak in Victoria, so we can use the concept of \"height\" (rule 3) to answer the question. We also need to compare it to other peaks in Victoria to determine that it is the highest (rule 8).\nThe answer: Mount Bogong", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Mount Bogong is the highest peak in the Victorian alpine areas and rises to almost 2,000 m (6,600 ft). Therefore, the answer is 1,986 m (6,516 ft).\nThe answer: 1,986 m (6,516 ft)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"topographically, geologically and climatically diverse areas\" in Victoria, and lists several river systems, indicating that there are diverse topological systems in the state. Rule 3 applies to differentiate between the concepts of size, shape, age, and color, and rule 8 applies to understand that if a certain type of system is mentioned in numbers, it implies that there are many of them. \nThe answer: diverse topological systems", "{rule list: 13, 15}\nExplanation: The article lists the state symbols of Victoria, including the helmeted honeyeater as the state bird.\nThe answer: helmeted honeyeater", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Victorian Alps in the northeast are the coldest part of Victoria.\nThe answer: northeast", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Victorian Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system. We can ignore the information about temperature extremes and focus on the relevant sentence. \nThe answer: Great Dividing Range", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Great Dividing Range mountain system extends east-west through the centre of Victoria.\nThe answer: east-west", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Victorian Alps are the highest part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the average temperature in the Victorian Alps is less than 9\u00b0C in winter, then the temperature in the highest parts of the ranges is more than 9\u00b0C in winter. \nThe answer: more than 9\u00b0C", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the lowest recorded temperature in Victoria. This information is directly stated in the passage, so no additional rules are needed to infer the answer.\nThe answer: \u221211.7 \u00b0C (10.9 \u00b0F)", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that rail lines in Victoria are government-owned, which falls under the concept of ownership and not nationality or profession. \nThe answer: the Victorian Government", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Metro Trains Melbourne operates an extensive, electrified, passenger system throughout Melbourne and suburbs. This indicates that a rail line operates in Melbourne.\nThe answer: Metro Trains Melbourne", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Victorian Government", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6}\nExplanation: Pacific National is a freight service operator, which falls under the concept of profession and is different from the concept of passenger rail lines, which is mentioned in the article as being operated by Metro Trains Melbourne and V/Line. Therefore, we can infer that Pacific National operates on freight lines, which are different from passenger lines in terms of their purpose and usage.\nThe answer: Pacific National operates on freight lines.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an extensive, electrified, passenger system", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Victoria has 37 seats in the Australian House of Representatives\". This directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 37", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Victoria has 12 seats in the Australian Senate.\nThe answer: 12", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts helps eliminate irrelevant information about the political parties in Victoria. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first helps identify that the lower house is mentioned after the upper house. The answer is: Legislative Assembly.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Parliament of Victoria consists of the Legislative Assembly (the lower house) and the Legislative Council (the upper house). \nThe answer: Legislative Council", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and \"current\" implies present time, which follows the rule that first comes before last (rule 16).\nThe answer: Linda Dessau", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: This question asks for a specific date, which can be found in the first sentence of the article. \nThe answer: 1 July 1851", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: still in 1851", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: one of the largest gold rushes the world has ever seen", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"in ten years the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000.\" This means that the population increased by a factor of 7, or 600%. The relevant rules are 3 (clarifying that population is a different concept from gold production) and 16 (establishing that \"ten years\" comes after the discovery of gold). \nThe answer: The population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of gold produced by Victoria in the years 1851-1860. Rule 3 states that size and quantity are different concepts, so we know that the answer will not include any descriptors like \"large\" or \"small\". Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if Victoria produced one third of the world's output, then the answer to the question is two thirds of the world's output. \nThe answer: 2/3 of the world's output", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names and locations are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the specific location mentioned in the article (Victoria) and the specific type of school mentioned (public). The order of first and last is also important, as we want to know how many public schools there were. \nThe answer: 1,548", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article provides a breakdown of the number of schools in Victoria, including public, Catholic, and independent schools. The question specifically asks for the number of Catholic schools, which is a different concept from public and independent schools. Therefore, rule 3 applies. The article states that there were 489 Catholic schools in Victoria. Additionally, rule 16 applies as the question asks for a specific number. \nThe answer: 489", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to extract the number of students enrolled in public schools in Victoria. Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept from other concepts, so we need to focus on the number. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last,\" so we can assume that the number of public schools is listed before the number of private schools. Therefore, the answer is 540,800. \nThe answer: 540,800", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Victoria has about 63,519 full-time teachers.\nThe answer: 63,519", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Over 61 per cent of private students attend Catholic schools.\" Rule 4 applies because profession and religion are different concepts, and rule 8 applies because the question asks for a percentage, which is the antonym of \"number.\" \nThe answer: Over 61%", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Victoria is the centre of dairy farming in Australia\" and this information is directly answering the question.\nThe answer: Victoria", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Victoria is home to 60% of Australia's 3 million dairy cattle.\nThe answer: 3 million", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that Victoria is home to 60% of Australia's 3 million dairy cattle.\nThe answer: 60%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Victoria produces nearly two-thirds of the nation's milk is not affected by any other information in the passage. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What proportion of Australia's milk is not produced in Victoria?\" The answer is one-third.\nThe answer: one-third", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Most abalone and rock lobster is exported to Asia.\" This indicates that the seafood caught in Victorian waters is shipped to Asia.\nThe answer: Asia", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept from other concepts is relevant because the question asks about the gauge of the rail lines, which is a measure of size. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A is also relevant because the question asks for the gauge of the Victorian rail lines, implying that there may be other gauges in use. \nThe answer: 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) broad gauge.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The question asks for the gauge to which some lines have been changed, which is a concept related to size. The passage states that some branch lines in the west of the state have been converted to 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) standard gauge, which is a smaller size than the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) broad gauge used in Victorian lines. Therefore, the answer is \"standard gauge\". \nThe answer: standard gauge", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The relevant rule is rule 3, which states that size is a different concept from other concepts. The answer is \"760 mm (2 ft 6 in).\"", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the narrow gauge rail lines were built in mountainous areas, which implies that they were not built in other areas of Victoria. Therefore, the answer is \"in mountainous areas.\" \nThe answer: in mountainous areas", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the mention of \"mountainous areas\" as a distraction. The rule that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\" helps identify that there were five formerly government-owned lines. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant. \nThe answer: five", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"After the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788...\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that the subject (who founded the colony) is not explicitly stated. However, we know from context that it was the British who founded the colony. Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that \"founding of the colony of New South Wales\" refers to the establishment of British settlement in Australia. We can also use rule 23 to understand that the passive sentence structure means that the subject is acted upon the verb, so \"founding of the colony of New South Wales\" is the answer to the question, not \"the British.\" \nThe answer: 1788", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the name of the eastern half of the colony is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"New South Wales\" is the first name mentioned and refers to the eastern half of the colony.\nThe answer: New South Wales", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that after the founding of the colony of New South Wales, Australia was divided into an eastern half named New South Wales and a western half named New Holland. \nThe answer: New Holland", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The colonial government that administered the new colony was located in Sydney, which was part of the eastern half of Australia named New South Wales. \nThe answer: Sydney.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1854 there was an armed rebellion at Ballarat against mining taxes.\nThe answer: 1854", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: British troops", "{1, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is a specific incident that occurred at Ballarat. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between the rebellion and the taxes. Rule 7 is relevant because \"incident\" is a synonym for \"rebellion.\" Rule 12 is relevant because the passage provides additional information that is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: Eureka Stockade", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the rebellion was against mining taxes and that the colonial authorities reformed the administration \"particularly reducing the hated mining licence fees.\" The use of the word \"reducing\" indicates a decrease in the fees. The negation in the question (\"reduce\") is important to note. \nThe answer: mining licence fees", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage of the Colony of Victoria Act 1855 gave Victoria responsible government. This is a straightforward question that only requires understanding the meaning of the word \"act\" and identifying the specific act mentioned in the passage. The relevant rules are 3 (to distinguish between different concepts), 16 (to understand the chronological order of events), and 23 (to understand the passive voice used in the sentence). \nThe answer: Colony of Victoria Act 1855", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The Premier of Victoria needs to lead the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. \nThe answer: the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The Premier, who is the leader of the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly, sets the legislative agenda. \nThe answer: The Premier", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts}\nExplanation: The passage states that cabinet consists of representatives elected to either house of parliament, but does not specify any particular profession or nationality. Therefore, anyone who is a representative in either house of parliament can be in the Victorian cabinet.\nThe answer: representatives elected to either house of parliament", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) is relevant because the question asks for the Premier of Victoria, which is a political position, not a nationality. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" (13) is also relevant because the question specifically asks for a person's name. \nThe answer: Daniel Andrews", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Cabinet members are representatives elected to either house of parliament.\nThe answer: Victorian cabinet members are elected representatives.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The gross value of Victorian agricultural production increased by 17% from 2003-04.\nThe answer: 17%", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The article states that the gross value of Victorian agricultural production increased by 17% during 2003-04.\nThe answer: 17%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant information is given in the passage: \"As of 2004, an estimated 32,463 farms occupied around 136,000 square kilometres (52,500 sq mi) of Victorian land.\" The number of farms is 32,463.\nThe answer: 32,463", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that farms occupy around 136,000 square kilometres of Victorian land, which comprises more than 60% of the state's total land surface. \nThe answer: around 136,000 square kilometres", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that farms occupy more than 60% of the state's total land surface, so the answer is 60%.\nThe answer: 60%", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from profession and nationality. Therefore, events are not related to the economy in terms of size, shape, age, or color. Additionally, profession and nationality are different concepts, so events are not related to the economy in terms of profession or nationality. \nThe answer: Events play a big part in tourism in Victoria's economy.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"sports tourism\" as another type of tourism in Victoria, which is different from cultural tourism.\nThe answer: sports tourism", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Victoria has major events that attract tourists, particularly cultural and sports events. Most of these events are centered on Melbourne, but others occur in regional cities. \nThe answer: Melbourne", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that while most events are centered on Melbourne, others occur in regional cities. \nThe answer: Outside of Melbourne, in regional cities.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Bells Beach SurfClassic", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Huguenot population was concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France. This means that the answer is: southern and central parts of France.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the meaning of \"numbers\" in the context. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" allows us to rephrase \"one-eighth the number of French Catholics\" as \"French Catholics outnumbered Huguenots by a factor of eight.\" \nThe answer: French Catholics outnumbered Huguenots by a factor of eight.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"a series of religious conflicts followed\" as Huguenots gained influence and openly displayed their faith, and these conflicts were fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The use of the word \"when\" in the question indicates a specific time period, so rule 2 is relevant for understanding that the Wars of Religion were fought during this time period. Rule 17 is also relevant for understanding that the question is asking for a positive answer, rather than a negative one. \nThe answer: 1562 to 1598", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Wars of Religion ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (the Wars of Religion) is acted upon the verb (ended) by the granting of the Edict of Nantes. Therefore, we need to apply rules 16 and 23 to determine that the Edict of Nantes ended the Wars of Religion.\nThe answer: The Edict of Nantes.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The Edict of Nantes granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.\nThe answer: granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the term Huguenot was originally used in derision and has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted, but the passage does not provide a clear answer. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that the term Huguenot was not meant to confer any specific size, shape, age, or color. Additionally, rule 7 tells us that we should look for synonyms in the question, and \"confer\" can be replaced with \"imply\" or \"mean\". \nThe answer: no specific meaning or implication", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the center of the Calvinist movement.\nThe answer: Geneva", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A) and 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts). The question asks for a politician's name, which is a different concept from the term \"Huguenot.\" The answer is Besan\u00e7on Hugues. \nThe answer: Besan\u00e7on Hugues", "{13, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a plot. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is the Amboise plot. \n\nThe answer: Amboise plot", "{3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. The question asks for a specific time period, so irrelevant information about the origins of the term Huguenot can be ignored. The answer can be found in the sentence \"The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560.\" \nThe answer: 1560.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages helped spread Protestantism in France because it allowed people to read and interpret the Scriptures for themselves, without relying on the clergy to do so for them. This was a key tenet of the Protestant movement, which emphasized individual interpretation of the Bible. \nThe answer: the availability of the Bible in vernacular languages", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by Guyard de Moulin around 1294, and a two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript was printed in Paris in 1487 by Jean de R\u00e9ly. Therefore, the first French language bible appeared around 1294.\nThe answer: around 1294", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Guyard de Moulin", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that a two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version of the French version of the Scriptures was printed in Paris in 1487. This means that the illustrated, paraphrased version appeared in 1487.\nThe answer: 1487", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the context, which states that Jean de R\u00e9ly's illustrated French-language scriptures were printed in Paris in 1487. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Neither of these rules are strictly necessary for this question, but they may be helpful in other cases. \nThe answer: Paris", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rules state that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and \"profession and nationality are different concepts\", so the answer cannot be any of those. The question asks for a collective term, which implies that the answer is a category or group. Therefore, the answer must be a term that refers to a group of towns. The only relevant information in the passage is that there were 66 of them and they were granted to the Huguenots by the Edict of 1598. Therefore, the answer is \"villes de s\u00fbret\u00e9\". \nThe answer: villes de s\u00fbret\u00e9", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Montpellier was \"among the most important\" of the 66 \"villes de s\u00fbret\u00e9\" granted to the Huguenots, but it does not provide information on which one was the most important. However, the article does mention Montpellier by name, so we can use the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" to determine that Montpellier is the answer.\nThe answer: Montpellier", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Montpellier was granted \"ville de s\u00fbret\u00e9\" status by the Edict of 1598, which granted limited autonomy to Huguenot cities. However, tension with Paris led to a siege in 1622 and the dismantling of the city's fortifications. The question asks for the proclamation that officially ended Huguenot autonomy, which is the Edict of Al\u00e8s in 1629. \nThe answer: Edict of Al\u00e8s", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that Montpellier was the subject being acted upon by the verb \"siege.\" Therefore, the answer is \"1622.\" \nThe answer: 1622", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The article does not explicitly state when the proclamation was issued, but it does mention the Edict of 1598, which granted Montpellier and other cities to the Huguenots. Therefore, the proclamation was issued in 1598.\nThe answer: 1598", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was Maria de la Queillerie, who arrived with her husband to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town. Therefore, the answer is Cape Town.\nThe answer: Cape Town", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope helped establish a settlement that is now known as Cape Town. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Maria de la Queillerie was the wife of a commander and the daughter of a church minister is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer is Cape Town. \nThe answer: Cape Town", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was Maria de la Queillerie, wife of commander Jan van Riebeeck. This means that the first name mentioned in the passage is the answer.\nThe answer: Maria de la Queillerie", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and names are equally important for the answer. The passage mentions the \"Dutch East India Company,\" which is a trading company and therefore falls under the concept of profession. The passage also mentions that the Huguenots settled near the Cape with the help of this company. \nThe answer: Dutch East India Company", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"quite a few arrived as late as 1700; thereafter, the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time.\" This means that the number of new Huguenot colonists declined after the year 1700.\nThe answer: 1700", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1624", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the Huguenots were \"barred by the government from settling in New France\" and instead settled in New Netherland and Great Britain's colonies. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the leader of the expedition, which is a different concept than the Huguenots themselves. Rule 13 applies because the question specifically asks for a person's name. \nThe answer: Jess\u00e9 de Forest", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the establishment of a Huguenot congregation in New Amsterdam, which continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit. This is the first Huguenot church in the New World.\nThe answer: L'Eglise fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la Nouvelle-Amsterdam / L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Huguenots were offered land across from Manhattan on Long Island and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek, becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, which is now known as Bushwick. Therefore, the answer is Brooklyn. \nThe answer: Brooklyn", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Charleston", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Elie Prioleau was a Huguenot pastor who settled in Charleston, South Carolina. According to the passage, he was from the town of Pons in France. \nThe answer: Pons", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1697", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Charleston, South Carolina.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that William III of Orange was the strongest opponent of Louis XIV. This implies that Louis XIV's main rival was William III of Orange.\nThe answer: William III of Orange", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Stadtholder William III of Orange later became King of England.\nThe answer: King of England", "{1, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the League of Augsburg was formed as a coalition to oppose Louis XIV. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for a coalition, which is a political concept, while the article mentions both political and national concepts (Dutch Republic, Huguenots, French-speaking Calvinist churches). Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the opposite of \"support,\" which is \"oppose.\" \nThe answer: the League of Augsburg", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the European country that the Huguenots felt kinship for emigration to. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the Huguenots were looking for a country to emigrate to is not related to their profession. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the Huguenots found the Dutch Republic to be the most attractive country for exile, then they must have felt less kinship for their home country of France. \nThe answer: Dutch Republic", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672, which is a specific event in the 17th century.\nThe answer: 1672", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the mention of \"proclamation\" in the question is important. Rule 8 is also important because it involves a comparison between two concepts. Rule 17 is important because the question contains the word \"abolished,\" which is a negation. \nThe answer: The Edict of Fontainebleau.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Louis XIV issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which abolished all legal recognition of Protestantism in France and forced the Huguenots to convert. Therefore, the answer is the date when the edict was declared.\nThe answer: 1685", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to a specific person who issued a declaration, so rule 4 applies to distinguish between profession and nationality. Rule 17 also applies to consider the negation in the question. \nThe answer: Louis XIV", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific number, which is a quantitative concept. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from color, so we can ignore any information about the color of the Huguenots. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"How many Huguenots did not flee France by the early 18th century?\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to take into account the negation in the rephrased question.\nThe answer: roughly 500,000", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The Catholic Church in France\nThe answer: The Catholic Church in France", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the height of this persecution was the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed.\" The use of the word \"height\" implies that this was the worst example of Huguenot persecution.\nThe answer: St. Bartholomew's Day massacre", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 5,000 to 30,000", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Huguenots had their own militia, indicating that they defended themselves through military means. Additionally, the use of the word \"retaliating\" suggests that they were responding to attacks or persecution. \nThe answer: They had their own militia.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that there were \"underlying political reasons\" for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, in addition to religious persecution. This implies that there was a non-religious reason for the massacre.\nThe answer: underlying political reasons", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629.\"\nThe answer: between 1621 and 1629", "{3, 8, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of the Huguenot rebellions, which is a matter of geography and falls under rule 3. Rule 8 is relevant because the question asks for the location in a negative form (\"where did these uprisings not take place?\"). Rule 13 is also relevant because the answer requires knowledge of a specific name or term. \nThe answer: southwestern France", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Henry IV was a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism and that he protected Protestants through the Edict of Nantes. Therefore, he is the King and former Huguenot who looked out for the welfare of the group.\nThe answer: Henry IV", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it is stated that \"His successor Louis XIII, under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother Marie de' Medici, became more intolerant of Protestantism.\" Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, and therefore we need to pay attention to the specific individual mentioned as the successor. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"resumed persecution\"), which means we need to look for a change in policy towards the Huguenots. \nThe answer: Louis XIII.", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"a series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out.\" The question asks for the name of these civil wars, which is provided in the passage as \"the Huguenot rebellions.\"\nThe answer: the Huguenot rebellions", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"approximately one million Protestants in modern France represent some 2% of its population.\" This means that the number of Protestants in France is 1 million. The relevant rules are 3 and 8, which state that size is a different concept from other concepts and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\nThe answer: 1 million", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The article states that approximately one million Protestants in modern France represent some 2% of its population.\nThe answer: 2%", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that most Protestants in France are concentrated in Alsace, which is in northeast France.\nThe answer: Alsace", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: C\u00e9vennes mountain region", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country where a group calls themselves Huguenots. The article mentions that approximately one million Protestants in modern France represent some 2% of its population and most are concentrated in Alsace in northeast France and the C\u00e9vennes mountain region in the south, who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day. Therefore, the answer is France.\nThe answer: France", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Huguenots formed three societies or congregations, one of which was located 21 miles north of New York in a town named New Rochelle. \nThe answer: New Rochelle", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: New Paltz", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the \"Huguenot Street Historic District\" in New Paltz has been designated a National Historic Landmark site. This indicates that the area designated as a historical landmark is the Huguenot Street Historic District in New Paltz.\nThe answer: Huguenot Street Historic District in New Paltz", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the \"Huguenot Street Historic District\" in New Paltz, which is designated as a National Historic Landmark site and contains the oldest street in the United States of America. \nThe answer: oldest street in the United States of America", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that a small group of Huguenots settled on the south shore of Staten Island, which is a borough of New York City. Therefore, the answer is Staten Island. \nThe answer: Staten Island", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that nationality is a different concept from profession, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks about a country, and the article mentions the Dutch Republic as the country that received the largest group of Huguenot refugees. Therefore, the answer is the Dutch Republic. \nThe answer: Dutch Republic", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, estimated to be between 75,000 and 100,000 people, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is between 75,000 and 100,000 people. \nThe answer: Between 75,000 and 100,000 people.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at the time of the Huguenot influx. Therefore, the population before the emigration was around 2 million.\nThe answer: around 2 million", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are not relevant to the answer. First comes before last. \nThe answer: Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia.", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the declaration that led to the emigration of Huguenot refugees, so we need to look for a negation in the passage. The passage mentions the \"revocation of the Edict of Nantes,\" which was a decree that had granted religious freedom to French Protestants, including Huguenots. Therefore, the negation of this decree led to the emigration of Huguenot refugees.\nThe answer: The revocation of the Edict of Nantes.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the Gate of King Hugo, which was located in Tours. No other relevant information is provided.\nThe answer: Tours", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for an alternative name for \"Huguon,\" which is mentioned in the first sentence. The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but the passage does provide an explanation for the origin of the name, which is attributed to Reguier de la Plancha. Therefore, the answer is not given directly in the passage and requires some inference. \nThe answer: The passage does not provide an alternative name for \"Huguon.\"", "{rule list: 13, 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity that allegedly haunted the gate. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a name in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to words like \"supposedly\" and \"allegedly.\" Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last, but there are only two entities mentioned in the passage, so this rule is not relevant. \nThe answer: le roi Huguet", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name by which the \"supposedly reformed\" were known. Rule 3 states that color, shape, age, and size are different concepts, so the word \"supposedly\" does not change the meaning of \"reformed\". Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"supposedly reformed\" can be replaced with \"these supposedly 'reformed'\". Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the answer is \"the 'supposedly reformed'\". \nThe answer: the 'supposedly reformed'", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time of day that the \"reformed\" gathered for their rituals. Rule 3 states that concepts such as time of day are different from concepts such as size or shape. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"gathered at night\" can be considered synonymous with \"time of day.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negation in the passage. The phrase \"supposedly 'reformed'\" implies that the author does not believe that these gatherings were truly reformed, so the answer is that there is no specific time of day mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: No specific time of day is mentioned.", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks where Huguenots and Walloons settled in England, so we need to identify the locations where they lived. The passage mentions several towns in Kent, including Sandwich, Faversham, and Maidstone, as well as Canterbury, where there is evidence of their presence in the form of weavers' houses and a weaving school. We can use rules 3 (locations are important), 4 (nationality and profession are different concepts), 7 (questions may contain synonyms), 12 (irrelevant passages can be ignored), 13 (names and locations are important), 16 (first and last are important), and 17 (negations are important) to arrive at the answer.\nThe answer: Canterbury, Sandwich, Faversham, and Maidstone.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Weavers", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Huguenot refugees in Canterbury practiced economic separation from the indigenous population by working as weavers and settling in towns with refugee churches. This demonstrates a difference in profession and possibly nationality between the refugees and the indigenous population. \nThe answer: economic separation", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The rules indicate that professions and locations are important for the answer, irrelevant passages should be ignored, and names are equally important. The answer: Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a restaurant", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Cork City", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"A number of Huguenots served as mayors in Dublin, Cork, Youghal and Waterford in the 17th and 18th centuries.\" \nThe answer: Dublin, Cork, Youghal, and Waterford.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: D'Olier Street is a street in Dublin named after a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland. The question asks for its location, which can be answered by applying rules 16 and 23 to determine that it is in Dublin. \nThe answer: Dublin", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and in a list of examples, the first comes before the last (rule 16).\nThe answer: a High Sheriff and one of the founders of the Bank of Ireland.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the French church in Portarlington \"dates back to 1696,\" indicating that it was built in that year.\nThe answer: 1696", "{3, 7, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a common term for the loss of key members of French society due to Huguenot emigration. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about these concepts. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"loss of key members of French society.\" Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can pay attention to any specific names or groups mentioned in the article. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to be careful not to choose an answer that is the opposite of what the question is asking. The answer is \"brain drain.\" \n\nThe answer: brain drain", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: New France", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that the French crown refused to allow non-Catholics to settle in New France. This means that persons who were not Catholic were not allowed to settle in New France.\nThe answer: non-Catholics", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the European conflict that the French and Indian War was a part of, which implies that the answer is a different conflict. Rules 3 and 4 establish that concepts such as nationality and events such as wars are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if the French and Indian War was a part of a European conflict, then the answer is not the French and Indian War itself. Rule 17 establishes that negations are important for the answer, which means that the answer should be a positive statement. \nThe answer: The Seven Years' War.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1759-60", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Henry of Navarre succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV\nThe answer: no previous name is given in the article", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the warfare was definitively quelled in 1598 when Henry of Navarre issued the Edict of Nantes.\nThe answer: 1598", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The Edict of Nantes granted the Protestants (Huguenots) equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains. This is the opposite of what was happening during the period of warfare mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: granted them equality with Catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The Edict of Nantes protected Catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions.\nThe answer: founding of new Protestant churches in Catholic-controlled regions.", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Henry of Navarre, having succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV, and having recanted Protestantism in favour of Roman Catholicism.\" Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that \"Henry of Navarre\" refers to the same person as \"Henry IV.\" Rule 17 states that \"negations are important for the answer,\" which means that the answer is \"Protestantism.\" \nThe answer: Protestantism", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the revocation required education of children as Catholics. This is a positive statement, so we do not need to apply rule 17. We also do not need to consider professions or nationalities, so we can apply rules 3 and 4 to determine that education is a different concept from size, shape, age, color, profession, and nationality. Finally, we can apply rule 8 to determine that if the Edict required Huguenot children to be educated as Catholics, then after the revocation, Huguenot children were not required to be educated as Protestants. Therefore, the answer is: Huguenot children were required to be educated as Catholics.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: It prohibited emigration.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 4,000", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Huguenots who stayed in France eventually converted to Catholicism and were called \"new converts\". This is a negation question, so rule 17 applies. Rule 4 also applies to differentiate between profession and nationality.\nThe answer: \"new converts\"", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that nationality and profession are different concepts means that the location where the Huguenots settled is not related to their profession. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B means that if some Huguenots settled in Britain and North America, then the Huguenots who did not settle in those places settled elsewhere. The answer: Holland, Prussia, and South Africa.", "{1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The first rule is relevant because it establishes a comparison between the destinations of the Huguenots. The fourth rule is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is important in identifying the destinations. The seventh rule is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms in the question. The twelfth rule is relevant because it allows for the exclusion of irrelevant information. The thirteenth rule is relevant because it establishes that names are important for the answer. The sixteenth rule is relevant because it establishes the importance of the order of information. \nThe answer: Switzerland and the Netherlands.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"a group of Huguenots was part of the French colonisers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found France Antarctique.\" This is a passive sentence, so we need to look for the object (\"France Antarctique\") to find the answer. Therefore, the answer is: 1555.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the French colonizers who arrived in Brazil in 1555 to found France Antarctique. Therefore, the answer is \"France Antarctique\".\nThe answer: France Antarctique", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese.\" This sentence is in the passive voice, so we need to use rule 23 to understand that the subject (Portuguese) acted upon the verb (destroyed) and the object (Fort Coligny). We also need to use rule 16 to understand that the year comes after the event. \nThe answer: 1560", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Guanabara Confession of Faith", "{rule list: 4, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that having a French surname does not necessarily mean that the family speaks French. The rule that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession means that the gender of the family members is irrelevant to their language. However, the rules that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names and \"his\" refer to male names and \"her\" refer to female names indicate that the language spoken by the families is likely to be Afrikaans, as they are described as \"mostly Afrikaans-speaking.\" \nThe answer: Afrikaans", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for an industry that descended from Huguenot settlers, which is a reference to their skills in vineyards and brandy distilling. This falls under the concept of profession, which is different from nationality. Additionally, the question is asking for a specific industry, which requires identifying a profession that is associated with a particular field. Finally, the question is asking about the descendants of the Huguenot settlers, which means that their names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: the wine industry", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that many farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names and that many families have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry. Therefore, the answer is in the Western Cape province in South Africa.\nThe answer: Western Cape province in South Africa", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that many families in South Africa have surnames indicating their French Huguenot ancestry, such as \"Blignaut, Cilliers, de Klerk (Le Clercq), de Villiers, du Plessis, Du Preez (Des Pres), du Randt (Durand), du Toit, Duvenhage(Du Vinage), Franck, Fouche, Fourie (Fleurit), Gervais, Giliomee (Guilliaume), Gous/Gouws (Gauch), Hugo, Jordaan (Jourdan), Joubert, Kriek, Labuschagne (la Buscagne), le Roux, Lombard, Malan, Malherbe, Marais, Maree, Minnaar (Mesnard), Nel (Nell),Naude', Nortje (Nortier), Pienaar (Pinard), Retief (Retif), Rossouw (Rousseau), Taljaard (Taillard), TerBlanche, Theron, Viljoen (Villion) and Visagie (Vis", "{rule list: 1, 3, 13, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question asks for a Revolutionary War midnight rider who was a Huguenot descendant. The answer is Jack Jouett, as stated in the article. Rules 1, 3, 13, 19, 20, and 21 are relevant because they ensure that the answer is focused on the specific person and their ancestry, rather than any other irrelevant information in the article. \nThe answer: Jack Jouett", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Henry Laurens", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The location of the last Huguenot congregation in the US is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Charleston, South Carolina.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Manakin Episcopal Church", "{4, 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer), 13 (names are equally important for the answer), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The passage mentions the Huguenot Society of America having chapters in numerous states, with the one in Texas being the largest. Therefore, the answer is Texas. \nThe answer: Texas", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Bedfordshire was one of the main centers of the British lace industry at the time. This information directly answers the question.\nThe answer: The lace industry", "{3, 7, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the belief that the style of lace known as 'Bucks Point' demonstrates a Huguenot influence is fallacious. This is due to the fact that Mechlin lace, which is a combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground, did not develop until the first half of the eighteenth century, long after the Huguenots settled in Bedfordshire. Additionally, there is no contemporary documentation to support the claim that there were Huguenot lacemakers in Bedfordshire. Therefore, rules 3 (different concepts), 7 (synonyms), 10 (typos), and 17 (negations) are relevant. \nThe answer: Bucks Point", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that there is no contemporary documentation to support the idea of Huguenot lacemakers in Bedfordshire, and that the only reference to immigrant lacemakers in that period is of twenty-five widows who settled in Dover. Therefore, there is no reference to Huguenot lacemakers in Bedfordshire in the 19th century.\nThe answer: None", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the development of Mechlin lace is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so any misspellings of \"Mechlin\" do not affect the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the wording of the question. The answer: first half of the eighteenth century.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from others, so the answer should not include any reference to the shape of the neighborhoods. The rule 16 states that the first item listed comes before the last, so the answer should list the neighborhoods in the order they were mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt.", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"one-fifth of the city's population was French speaking.\" This means that out of every five people in Berlin, one spoke French.\nThe answer: one-fifth", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: In protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07.", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period, which can be answered by identifying the relevant information in the passage. The passage states that the Huguenots switched to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07.\nThe answer: 1806-07", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" (rule 13) is relevant here, as the question specifically asks for other cities with Huguenot congregations. Rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) are not relevant. Rule 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph) is somewhat relevant, as the question uses the phrase \"Northern European cities\" instead of explicitly asking for cities in the article. The answer is: Fredericia (Denmark), Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that being a Calvinist ruler is a profession and not a nationality. Therefore, we need to use rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can say that Prussia had a Calvinist ruler, so the answer is Prussia.", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the \"last remaining bastion\" which implies that all other bastions have been lost. Rule 3 applies because the answer refers to a specific region in France. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the \"last remaining bastion\" which implies a chronological order. \nThe answer: the rugged C\u00e9vennes region in the south.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Camisards", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Catholic Church", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: between 1702 and 1709", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1564, a group of Norman Huguenots established the small colony of Fort Caroline on the banks of the St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville, Florida. This is a straightforward answer that requires no additional rules beyond identifying the location and time period mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: Jacksonville", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"a group of Norman Huguenots under the leadership of Jean Ribault established the small colony of Fort Caroline.\" This means that Jean Ribault was the leader who established the colony at Florida.\nThe answer: Jean Ribault", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1564, a group of Norman Huguenots established the small colony of Fort Caroline on the banks of the St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville, Florida.\nThe answer: Fort Caroline", "{rule list: 2, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that a French naval attack against the Spanish colony at St. Augustine failed and the stranded French soldiers surrendered to the Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez, who proceeded to massacre the Huguenots and wipe out the Fort Caroline garrison. Therefore, the answer is the Spanish army.\nThe answer: Spanish", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the colony \"survived only a short time\" and that it was destroyed after the French naval attack failed and the Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez massacred the defenseless Huguenots and wiped out the Fort Caroline garrison. This implies that the destruction of the colony happened after the French naval attack and the massacre. Therefore, we can infer that the colony was destroyed in 1565.\nThe answer: 1565", "{rule list: 1, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is a specific name, which means that rules 12 and 13 are relevant for identifying it. The passage provides two names, Charlesfort and Fort Caroline, but the question asks for the name of the first outpost in South Carolina, which means that rule 1 is relevant for determining that Charlesfort is not the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is Fort Caroline.\nThe answer: Fort Caroline", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the settlement of St. Augustine was established near Fort Caroline. \nThe answer: Jacksonville, Florida.", "{rule list: 1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"In 1565 the Spanish decided to enforce their claim to La Florida, and sent Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s, who established the settlement of St. Augustine near Fort Caroline.\" Rule 1 applies because \"Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s\" is the subject of the sentence and \"established the settlement of St. Augustine\" is the verb phrase, indicating that he is the one who performed the action. Rule 16 applies because \"Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s\" is the first and last name of the person in question. Rule 23 applies because the sentence is in the active voice. \nThe answer: Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Ribault first established a settlement in South Carolina in 1562.\nThe answer: 1562", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Wars of Religion", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article compares the land grants promised to the Huguenots in Lower Norfolk County with the land they were offered in Manakin Town. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the name of the English colony, which is a different concept from the land grants or the location of Manakin Town. Rule 13 applies because the name of the colony is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Virginia", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the French Huguenots were promised land grants in Lower Norfolk County, but were instead offered land 20 miles above the falls of the James River, at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town, now in Powhatan County. \nThe answer: Powhatan County", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the colonial authorities offered the Huguenots land at the abandoned Monacan village known as Manakin Town, which is now in Powhatan County, 20 miles above the falls of the James River, instead of the land grants promised in Lower Norfolk County. Therefore, the town actually granted to the Huguenots on arrival was Manakin Town.\nThe answer: Manakin Town", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas.\" This means that the original number of settlers was 390.\nThe answer: 390", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that on May 12, 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalize the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (the Huguenots) is acted upon the verb (naturalized). Therefore, we need to apply rules 16 and 23 to determine that the answer is May 12, 1705. \nThe answer: May 12, 1705.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the passage, the Dutch Revolt is mentioned as happening between 1568-1609, so the answer is 1568. \nThe answer: 1568", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Spain", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the \"Apologie\" of William the Silent", "{rule list: 4, 13, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the leader of the Dutch Revolt and the author of the Apologie. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about their professions. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the leader and author. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the leader's name comes before the author's name. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can assume that the leader is male. \nThe answer: William the Silent", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The article mentions that William the Silent was the leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. Therefore, he was a Calvinist.\nThe answer: Calvinist", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the 1708 passage of the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act, which implies that there was a previous time when England was less welcoming to Huguenots. The use of the word \"both\" indicates a contrast between the two periods. The negation in the question (\"more welcoming\") is important to note. \nThe answer: The Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act was passed in 1708. Rule 3 states that age and time are different concepts, and rule 16 states that when a specific year is mentioned, it comes before any other time reference. \nThe answer: 1708", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 50,000", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a person, so rule 16 applies. The article mentions Andrew Lortie as a leading Huguenot theologian and writer who led the exiled community in London, so rule 4 applies to distinguish his profession from his nationality.\nThe answer: Andrew Lortie", "{rule list: 3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Lortie openly criticized the doctrine of transubstantiation during Mass, which is a liturgical belief of the Catholic Church. This is indicated by the use of the word \"articulating their criticism\" in the passage, which implies that Lortie was vocal about his opposition to this belief. The use of the word \"criticism\" also suggests a negative view of the belief. Therefore, rules 3, 4, and 17 are relevant, as they help to distinguish between different concepts (such as religion and nationality) and indicate the importance of negations in the answer. \nThe answer: the doctrine of transubstantiation during Mass", "{rule list: 3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Huguenot regiments fought for William of Orange in the Williamite war in Ireland.\" Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as war and settlements. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that events in a text are presented in chronological order. Rule 17 is relevant because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Williamite war", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The question asks for the leader under whom the Huguenots fought in the Williamite war in Ireland. The answer would be William of Orange.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions significant Huguenot settlements in Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford, and Youghal. \nThe answer: Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford, and Youghal.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Huguenot settlements in Killeshandra contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the Irish linen industry.\nThe answer: Irish linen industry", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Huguenots contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the fact that Waterford and Youghal are listed after Lisburn is not relevant to the answer. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so the fact that the Huguenots settled in Ireland is not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Irish linen industry", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbr\u00fccken", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the Count that Prince Louis de Cond\u00e9 made an arrangement with. This involves recognizing that \"Prince Louis de Cond\u00e9\" and \"Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbr\u00fccken\" are two different individuals, falling under rule 13. Additionally, since \"Count\" is a title indicating nationality rather than profession, rule 4 applies. \nThe answer: Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbr\u00fccken", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Prince Louis de Cond\u00e9 and his sons established a Huguenot community in present-day Saarland in 1604, and how they established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years. Therefore, the answer is glass-making. \nThe answer: glass-making", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Some members of this community emigrated to the United States in the 1890s.\" This is a straightforward answer that can be found by identifying the time period mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: 1890s", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The year of the agreement is a specific piece of information that can be found in the passage. Rule 16 helps to establish the chronological order of events, while rule 22 clarifies that \"the Cond\u00e9s\" refers to Prince Louis de Cond\u00e9 and his sons. \nThe answer: 1604", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that location is important for the answer and that different locations are different concepts. The answer is that the Electorate of Brandenburg and the Electorate of the Palatinate received Huguenot refugees.\nThe answer: Electorate of Brandenburg and Electorate of the Palatinate", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Huguenots relocated to Protestant European nations, which implies that the nations had a common religious belief in Protestantism. \nThe answer: Protestantism", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Quebec", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Dutch Cape Colony", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: acceptance and freedom to worship", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if a group is associated with a certain concept, then the opposite group is associated with the opposite concept. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 13 applies because it clarifies that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Hugues Capet", "{3, 8, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the theory that the name \"Huguenot\" originated from the French king Hugues Capet. Rule 3 states that concepts such as names are different from concepts such as size or shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is the \"Hugues hypothesis\". \nThe answer: The Hugues hypothesis.", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a specific person mentioned in the article. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can't assume that the person's profession is relevant to the answer. Rule 7 is relevant because the question may contain synonyms, so we need to look for any mention of someone who supports the \"Hugues hypothesis.\" Rule 13 is relevant because names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Janet Gray", "{1, 2, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is derived from the \"Hugues hypothesis\" which argues that the name \"Huguenot\" was derived by association with Hugues Capet, king of France, who reigned long before the Reformation. Supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo. Therefore, the answer is \"those who want Hugo\". \nThe answer: those who want Hugo", "{3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the question. The question asks for other theories of the word's origin, which implies that the \"Hugues hypothesis\" was already mentioned in the article. Therefore, irrelevant passages can be ignored. The question uses the word \"classed,\" which is a synonym for \"categorized.\" Therefore, rule 7 applies. Finally, rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"other,\" which implies that the \"Hugues hypothesis\" is already a theory of the word's origin. \nThe answer: categorized as other theories", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a person who was a French pro-reform Roman Catholic of the 15th century. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A is a pro-reform Roman Catholic and B is French, then A and B are different concepts. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 13 is relevant because it establishes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Jacques Lefevre", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the location where the pro-reform leader taught, which is indicated in the passage as \"a professor at the University of Paris.\" The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb), as they help identify the subject (\"pro-reform leader\") and the verb (\"teach\") in the sentence. \nThe answer: University of Paris", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: This question asks for a specific date related to a leader's publication of a French language Bible. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the leader mentioned in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negations in the question or passage. The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but we can infer that the leader in question is Jacques Lefevre, as he is mentioned as a professor at the University of Paris who published a French translation of the New Testament and the whole Bible. The passage states that he published the New Testament in 1523 and the whole Bible in French in 1530, so the answer is 1530.\nThe answer: 1530", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: William Farel", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify the person's profession without being misled by their nationality. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the person's name correctly.\nThe answer: Jean Cauvin (John Calvin)", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre took place between August 24 and October 3, 1572, with the main massacre occurring on August 23-24 in Paris. This means that the answer is August 24 - October 3, 1572. \nThe answer: August 24 - October 3, 1572.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the group that killed the Huguenots, implying that the Huguenots were the ones being killed. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a group, which is a different concept than the number of fatalities. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the group that killed the Huguenots, implying that the group is responsible for the killings.\nThe answer: Catholics", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Toulouse is a town is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that between 3,000 and 7,000 Protestants were killed in the French provinces and that nearly 3,000 Protestants were slaughtered in Toulouse alone, we can infer that the number of Huguenots killed in Toulouse is less than 3,000. \nThe answer: less than 3,000", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: Amnesty was granted to the perpetrators of the massacre, so we need to find the date when this happened. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a statement that says the perpetrators were no longer punished. Rule 22 tells us that \"former\" refers to the first entity mentioned and \"latter\" to the last, so we need to make sure we are looking for the correct event. The answer: 1573.", "{1, 2, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage provides a timeline of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, stating that between 2,000 and 3,000 Protestants were killed in Paris on August 23-24, and between 3,000 and 7,000 more in the French provinces. By September 17, almost 25,000 Protestants had been massacred in Paris alone. Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Rule 2 applies because it clarifies that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. Rule 7 applies because it clarifies that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 12 applies because it clarifies that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because it clarifies that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: almost 25,000", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, \"Louis XIV\" is mentioned before the year \"1643,\" indicating that Louis XIV became king in that year.\nThe answer: Louis XIV", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Louis XIV \"acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert\" and \"imposed penalties, closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favored professions.\" This implies that he was more hostile towards the Huguenots than his predecessors. Therefore, according to rule 1, his predecessors were less hostile towards the Huguenots than he was. This means that he was more antonym(hostile) towards the Huguenots than his predecessors. \nThe answer: He acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the first approach that Louis XIV took towards the Huguenots. Rules 1, 2, and 3 are relevant because they establish that if Louis XIV's approach changed over time, then the answer should reflect his initial approach. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that the question should not be interpreted as asking for Louis XIV's nationality. Rule 5 is relevant because it establishes that the question should not be interpreted as asking for the shape, size, age, or color of Louis XIV's approach. Rule 6 is relevant because it establishes that the question should not be interpreted as asking for an animal or vehicle. Rule 8 is relevant because it establishes that if Louis XIV's approach changed over time, then the answer should reflect the antonym of his initial approach. Rule 12 is relevant because it establishes that irrelevant passages should be ignored. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the answer should reflect Louis XIV's first approach. \nThe answer: Louis XIV sent missionaries.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks about what the king did regarding Huguenot education, implying that he took some action. The answer is that he closed Huguenot schools. \nThe answer: He closed Huguenot schools.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the term used for the practice of occupying and looting Huguenot homes. Rule 3 tells us that different concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are not interchangeable. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. The answer: dragonnades.", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the county where New Rochelle is located. Rule 14 states that locations are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the information provided in the article about the location of New Rochelle. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts like size, shape, age, and color are different from concepts like location, so we can ignore any information in the article that is not related to the location of New Rochelle. \nThe answer: Westchester", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the original landing location of the Huguenots, which is a comparison between their first location and any subsequent locations. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a location, which is a different concept than the size, shape, age, or color of the location. Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a specific name/location. \nThe answer: \"Bauffet's Point\" on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Huguenots purchased the land from John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, with the help of Jacob Leisler. Therefore, we need to use rule 13 to consider names as important for the answer and rule 16 to determine that \"John Pell\" comes before \"Jacob Leisler\" in the sequence of events.\nThe answer: John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that New Rochelle was named after La Rochelle, their former stronghold in France. This is a straightforward answer that does not require any complex rules.\nThe answer: La Rochelle", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes the history of the Huguenots in New Rochelle, including the construction of three churches. Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other attributes, so the fact that the first two churches were made of different materials is irrelevant. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the question specifically asks for the name of the third church. \nThe answer: Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: Huguenots in North America eventually affiliated with other Protestant denominations with more numerous members, indicating that they adapted and changed their religious beliefs. This is supported by the fact that they assimilated quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities. \nThe answer: They adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities, which led to their assimilation.", "{3, 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Huguenots adapted quickly, often married outside their French communities, and their descendants continued to use French names and surnames. This shows assimilation into North American society. Rule 3 is relevant to distinguish assimilation from cultural preservation. Rule 4 is relevant to distinguish profession from nationality. Rule 12 is relevant to ignore irrelevant information. Rule 17 is relevant to consider negations. \nThe answer: They adapted quickly, often married outside their French communities, and their descendants continued to use French names and surnames.", "{3, 4, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The rules indicate that profession and nationality are different concepts, names are equally important for the answer, and first comes before last. The passage mentions E.I. du Pont as a prominent Huguenot-descended arms manufacturer. \nThe answer: E.I. du Pont", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Huguenot descendants continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century.\nThe answer: well into the nineteenth century", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of du Pont's gunpowder operation, which is a specific piece of information mentioned in the article. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we should not confuse du Pont's profession as a gunpowder mill owner with his nationality as a French Huguenot. Rule 13 is also relevant because it reminds us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the specific name mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: Eleutherian gunpowder mills", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"One of the most prominent Huguenot refugees in the Netherlands was Pierre Bayle.\" This answer is a straightforward identification of a person, so rules 1, 4, and 13 are the most relevant. \nThe answer: Pierre Bayle", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. Rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, is also not relevant. Rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first, is relevant because it helps us identify that Pierre Bayle began teaching in Rotterdam.\nThe answer: Rotterdam", "{3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that different concepts such as age, shape, and color are not interchangeable. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: Historical and Critical Dictionary", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Pierre Bayle's Historical and Critical Dictionary became one of the 100 foundational texts of the US Library of Congress. Therefore, the answer is the US Library of Congress.\nThe answer: US Library of Congress", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that some Huguenot families celebrate the feast of their patron Saint Nicolas, which is similar to the Dutch Sint Nicolaas feast. This implies that Saint Nicolas is the patron saint of the Huguenots.\nThe answer: Saint Nicolas", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions the \"French Protestant Church of London\" which was established by Royal Charter in 1550. This is the early Huguenot Church referred to in the question.\nThe answer: French Protestant Church of London", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer is a specific date, which can be found by identifying the time when the French Protestant Church of London was established by Royal Charter. This requires understanding that \"established by Royal Charter\" is a passive construction, where the subject (who established the church) is not explicitly stated. Therefore, rule 23 is relevant for understanding passive constructions. Additionally, the question asks for a specific time, which requires understanding the importance of chronological order, as described in rule 16.\nThe answer: 1550.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the French Protestant Church of London is now located at Soho Square.\nThe answer: Soho Square", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Shoreditch", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1724", "{rule list: 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. Therefore, the relevant rule is that profession and nationality are different concepts. \nThe answer: Lutheran and Reformed", "{3, 4, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Huguenot refugees found a safe haven in the Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia. The question asks which areas of Northern Europe practiced those religions. Rule 3 states that concepts such as religion are different from concepts such as size or shape. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the refugees found a safe haven in Lutheran and Reformed states in Germany and Scandinavia is relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article mentions Lutheran and Reformed states, it implies that other areas did not practice those religions. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the information about the Huguenots furnishing regiments for the army and settling in specific territories is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that the question asks which areas practiced those religions implies that the answer should list the areas where those religions were", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Edict of Potsdam granted special privileges to Huguenots in Brandenburg-Prussia.\nThe answer: Edict of Potsdam", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Frederick William held the titles of Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia.\nThe answer: Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Huguenots furnished two new regiments of his army: the Altpreu\u00dfische Infantry Regiments No. 13 (Regiment on foot Varenne) and 15 (Regiment on foot Wylich).", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the German ruler who invited Huguenots to settle in his realms. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a profession. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the answer must include the name of the ruler. \nThe answer: Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Theodor Fontane", "{rule list: 4, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 applies because profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question asks for a German general and fighter pilot. The rule 13 applies because names are equally important for the answer, and the question specifically asks for a person's name. The rule 20 applies because \"he\" refers to male names. \nThe answer: Adolf Galland", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that \"Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re\" is the last name in the sentence and therefore the answer we are looking for. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that \"final Prime Minister\" is a passive construction, and therefore \"Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re\" is the subject of the sentence and the answer to the question.\nThe answer: Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re", "{4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can't assume that Thomas de Maiziere's nationality is relevant to his role in the German cabinet. However, rule 20 states that \"his\" refers to male names, so we can assume that Thomas de Maiziere is male. Therefore, the answer is: German Federal Minister of the Interior.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The question asks for a non-combustion heat source mentioned in the article, and the article lists three: solar power, nuclear power, and geothermal energy. Therefore, the answer is: solar power.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is also not relevant to this question. Rule 23 states that in the Rankine cycle, water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure, then expanded through pistons or turbines, and finally condensed and pumped back into the boiler. Therefore, the answer is the Rankine cycle. \nThe answer: Rankine cycle", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3, which states that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts,\" is relevant because it clarifies that the working fluid in a steam engine is not an animal or a vehicle. Rule 8, which states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A,\" is also relevant because it allows us to infer that if water is heated and transforms into steam, then when it is not heated, it is not steam. \nThe answer: steam", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific detail about the Rankine cycle, which is described in the passage. Rule 3 reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and not relevant to the answer. Rule 9 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the pressure at which water is heated, so we can infer that it is at a high pressure since it is later described as being expanded through pistons or turbines. Therefore, the answer is \"high pressure.\" \n\nThe answer: high pressure", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: external combustion engines", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a comparison between different engines, and the question asks for the first commercially successful one. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that the answer should refer to the concept of an engine, not to its size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: The atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712.", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the atmospheric engine was an improvement over Savery's steam pump. Rule 3 applies because the article mentions that the atmospheric engine used a piston, which is a different concept than Savery's steam pump. Rule 13 applies because the question asks for the name of the inventor. \nThe answer: Thomas Newcomen", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we can infer that the atmospheric engine was invented before the second half of the 18th century. The rule 22 states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\", so we can conclude that the atmospheric engine was invented around 1712.\nThe answer: around 1712", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a steam pump", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine used a piston, which was proposed by Papin. Therefore, Papin conceptualized the piston.\nThe answer: Papin", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the country where the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was invented. Rule 1 applies because it compares the invention to others in the world. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the location and the invention itself. Rule 13 applies because the answer requires the specific location of the invention. \nThe answer: United Kingdom", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The question asks for the date of the first railway trip in the world, which is a specific event. Rule 1 applies because it compares the importance of different dates. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific date. \nThe answer: 21 February 1804", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Trevithick's steam locomotive hauled a train from Pen-y-darren ironworks to Abercynon, so Abercynon is the endpoint of the world's first railway journey.\nThe answer: Abercynon", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The location of Merthyr Tydfil is important for the answer, so rule 14 applies. The question contains a negation (\"not located in\"), so rule 17 applies. \nThe answer: Wales", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Abercynon is located in south Wales.\nThe answer: south Wales", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about the device used to recycle the boiler water, which is the water pump.\nThe answer: water pump", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps, but also notes that other types may be used. \nThe answer: Multi-stage centrifugal pumps", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Injectors became popular in the 1850s, which is a specific decade.\nThe answer: 1850s", "{3, 5, 12}\nExplanation: The passage explains that injectors are no longer widely used except in applications such as steam locomotives. This means that a notable application of injectors today is in steam locomotives.\nThe answer: steam locomotives", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Injectors are used to supply lower-pressure boiler feed water.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that triple expansion engines use three expansion stages. \nThe answer: three", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being related to the physical characteristics of the engines. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being related to animals. Therefore, the answer must be related to the concept of engines. The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" applies because the article states that engines can have either three or four expansion stages, and four is more than three. Therefore, engines using four expansion stages are most commonly known as quadruple expansion engines.\nThe answer: quadruple expansion engines", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing system being used in the late 19th century.\nThe answer: late 19th century", "{3, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing system being used on some marine triple expansion engines. This means that the engines utilizing this system are triple expansion engines, which are a type of multiple expansion engine. Additionally, the passage mentions that this system was popular with large passenger liners, indicating that it was used in marine engines. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3 (different concepts) and 5 (animals and vehicles are different concepts), as well as 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). \nThe answer: Triple expansion engines on large passenger liners.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine was popular with large passenger liners. This implies that the answer is a type of ship that would use this type of engine, which would be a large passenger liner.\nThe answer: large passenger liners", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from profession and nationality. Therefore, the answer cannot be related to any of those concepts. The passage mentions poppet valve gears as a type of gear that utilized separate admission and exhaust valves to give ideal events, so the answer is poppet valve gears.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The question is asking for an example of a simple motion, so the order in which the motions are listed is important. The answer: Joy.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Lap is provided by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This means that the admission side port is overlapped. \nThe answer: By overlapping the admission side port.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: lead fusible plugs", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If the water level drops, the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly, causing the lead fusible plugs to melt and the steam to escape, warning the operators. \nThe answer: They melt and the steam escapes.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it clarifies that the physical properties of the lead fusible plugs are not important to the answer. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because it applies to the question's phrasing of \"what happens after the lead melts,\" implying that something else happens as a result. Therefore, the answer is: the steam escapes, warning the operators.", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The operators may manually suppress the fire.\nThe answer: manually suppress the fire.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept means that the size of the boiler is important to the answer. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B means that the answer is the opposite of what the steam escape is likely to accomplish in the smallest boilers. \nThe answer: Lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: James Watt", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the type of motion produced by Watt's steam engine, which is a characteristic or property of the engine and not a comparison to other entities. Therefore, rule 3 applies. The question also uses the word \"continuous,\" which implies that the motion produced is ongoing and uninterrupted, indicating a positive comparison. Therefore, rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: rotary motion.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a specific amount of horsepower, which can be compared between different engines. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific feature of Watt's engine. \nThe answer: ten", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that by 1883, engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible. This implies that as of 1883, 10,000 horsepower engines were available.\nThe answer: 1883", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, as well as the rules that profession and nationality are different concepts and that animals and vehicles are different concepts, are not relevant to this question. The rule that negations are important for the answer is also not relevant. The answer can be found by applying the rule that the subject of a passive sentence is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution\" is in the passive voice, with \"the Industrial Revolution\" being the subject that is acted upon by the verb \"was\". Therefore, the answer is: the Industrial Revolution.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the century in which the history of the steam engine began. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, we can say that the history of the steam engine began before the first century AD. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from other concepts like size, shape, and color. Therefore, we can answer the question by saying that the history of the steam engine began in the first century AD or earlier.\nThe answer: First century AD or earlier.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the aeolipile was described by Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria.\nThe answer: Hero of Alexandria", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"the first recorded rudimentary steam engine being the aeolipile described by Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria.\"\nThe answer: Greek", "{rule list: 1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who described a steam turbine in 1629. Rule 1 tells us that if A did X before B, then B did X after A. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from other characteristics. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we can infer that Giovanni Branca described a steam turbine in 1629, which was after the aeolipile and before Denis Papin's work on the steam digester.\nThe answer: Giovanni Branca", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1606", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"compound engines\" came into widespread use near the end of the 19th century. \"Compound engines\" is a specific type of engine, so rule 3 applies to differentiate it from other concepts like size, shape, age, and color. The answer is compound engines.\nThe answer: compound engines", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the passage states that compound engines exhaust steam into successively larger cylinders, which implies that the cylinders are increasing in size. Therefore, if we ask for the name of these stages, we should use the antonym of \"larger,\" which is \"smaller.\" The answer is \"expansions.\" \n\nThe answer: expansions", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the use of compound engines, specifically double and triple expansion engines, in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.\nThe answer: shipping", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of nationality being the answer. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of electric motors being the answer. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies, as the question asks for what overtook steam engines, implying that steam engines were once the dominant source of power. Therefore, the answer is internal combustion engines. \nThe answer: internal combustion engines", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that double and triple expansion engines were common in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried. Therefore, the product shipped in vessels equipped with these engines was likely coal.\nThe answer: Coal", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the evolution of the steam engine and how it eventually led to the use of steam turbines, which were more efficient and had fewer moving parts than reciprocating piston engines. The question asks for the device that represented the last major evolution of the steam engine, and the answer is steam turbines.\nThe answer: steam turbines", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that steam turbines were introduced in the late part of the 19th century.\nThe answer: late part of the 19th century", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the efficiency of steam turbines to reciprocating piston type steam engines. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts, in this case, the concepts of efficiency and horsepower. \nThe answer: several hundred horsepower", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to find the percentage of electrical power in the United States made by steam turbines, which is a comparison between two things. Therefore, we apply rule 3 to understand that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and cannot be compared. We also apply rule 8 to understand that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The passage states that \"Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines. In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources.\" Therefore, the answer is 90%.\nThe answer: 90%", "{3, 5, 6, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the type of power generated by steam turbines, which is a different concept from the shape, size, age, or color. It also specifies that it is not referring to vehicles, which are a different concept from animals. The question contains a negation, which is important for the answer. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3, 5, 6, and 8.\nThe answer: electric power", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. These rules help us eliminate irrelevant information about the various sources of heat for boiling water in a steam engine. The answer is \"burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space\". \nThe answer: Burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and size are different concepts is irrelevant to the question. The rule that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph is also irrelevant. The answer can be found in the sentence \"The heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (called variously combustion chamber, firebox).\" The phrase \"called variously\" indicates that there is another name for the space in which combustible material is burned, and that name is \"combustion chamber.\" \nThe answer: combustion chamber", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of \"animal energy\" being the answer. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of any of those being the answer. Therefore, the answer is \"solar energy\". \nThe answer: solar energy", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. The answer: electric heating element.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the steam engine indicator, which is used to analyze the performance of steam engines. The answer is \"steam engine indicator\". \nThe answer: steam engine indicator", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1851", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: There is no mention of a company developing the steam engine indicator, only individuals (Charles Richard and Charles Porter). Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the given article.", "{rule list: 2, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the person who developed a successful steam engine indicator for Charles Porter. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a name in the passage. Rule 2 states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, \"successful\" is a synonym for \"useful,\" so we can use this rule to determine that the person who developed the most useful steam engine indicator is the most successful. Finally, rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the name \"Charles Richard\" as the person who developed the successful steam engine indicator for Charles Porter.\nThe answer: Charles Richard", "{rule list: 2, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Charles Porter steam engine indicator was exhibited at the London Exhibition in 1862. This indicates that the exhibition was held in London and that the indicator was shown there.\nThe answer: London Exhibition", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that shape is a different concept from other concepts is relevant because it distinguishes the concept of the angle between the pistons and the cranks from other concepts such as size or color. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it specifies the order in which the pistons and cranks are mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: 90\u00b0", "{2, 16}\nExplanation: For a 4-cylinder compound engine, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180\u00b0, which means they are directly opposite each other. This follows rule 2, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, the individual pistons are X (balanced) and the opposite of X (unbalanced), so they are least/most X and most/least antonym(X) respectively. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which means that the first piston is balanced with the third piston and the second piston is balanced with the fourth piston. \nThe answer: 180\u00b0, directly opposite each other", "{2, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because the question asks about the angle between the groups of pistons, which is a spatial relationship. The rule 16 applies because the question asks about the specific arrangement of pistons in a 4-cylinder compound. \nThe answer: 90\u00b0 to each other.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a term that describes the reversing of steam flow in a piston engine after each stroke. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so those are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can use the antonym of \"reversing\" which is \"non-reversing\" to describe piston engines that do not reverse the steam flow after each stroke. Therefore, the term for the reversing of steam flow in a piston engine after each stroke is \"counterflow\". \nThe answer: counterflow", "{rule list: 3, 6}\nExplanation: The article explains that in reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke, and the complete engine cycle occupies two piston strokes. \nThe answer: 2", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank. \nThe answer: 1", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the engine cycle comprises four events - admission, expansion, exhaust, and compression.\nThe answer: 4", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the engine cycle comprises four events: admission, expansion, exhaust, and compression. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that \"event\" is a distinct concept from size, shape, and color. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can be sure that \"event\" refers to a specific term used in the context. \nThe answer: expansion", "{3, 5, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Quasiturbine as a type of uniflow engine that intakes steam in hot areas and exhausts it in cold areas. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, which is also not relevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which is relevant as the question uses the phrase \"takes in steam in hot areas and exhausts it in cold\" as a synonym for \"uniflow engine.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: Quasiturbine", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes how the uniflow engine attempts to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle, where the port and cylinder walls are cooled by the passing exhaust steam while the hotter incoming admission steam wastes some of its energy in restoring working temperature. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the issue that the uniflow engine attempts to fix, so we can use the antonym of \"fix\" which is \"arise\" to determine the answer. \nThe answer: the issue of the usual counterflow cycle where the steam flows in two directions.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article discusses how uniflow engines aim to improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke, allowing steam to flow only in one direction and resolving the issue of the counterflow cycle. This relates to rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is: an additional port.", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is: oscillating cylinder steam engine.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"shape\" is a different concept from \"location\" means that the term for the pivot mounting cannot be described as a shape. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" means that we can look for a synonym for \"pivot mounting\" in the passage. \nThe answer: trunnion", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that oscillating cylinder steam engines are mainly used in toys and models, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.\nThe answer: ships", "{rule list: 5, 8}\nExplanation: Oscillating cylinder steam engines are mainly used in toys and models, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued. Therefore, we can infer that full size working engines on ships sometimes use oscillating cylinder steam engines.\nThe answer: ships", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: In a closed loop system, the working fluid is recycled continuously. This means that it is not released to the atmosphere and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is not needed. This is in contrast to an \"open loop\" system where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere and a separate source of water is needed. Therefore, rule 3 (clarifying the difference between concepts) and rule 23 (distinguishing between active and passive sentences) are relevant. \nThe answer: It is recycled continuously.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the working fluid in a Rankine cycle can be an \"open loop\" system where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere. This implies that the system that releases the exhaust steam into the atmosphere is an \"open loop\" system and not a \"closed loop\" system. Additionally, the use of the word \"directly\" in the question indicates a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: an \"open loop\" system", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine.\" This answer is straightforward and does not require any complex reasoning or inference.\nThe answer: Mercury", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that water is the fluid of choice for a steam engine due to its favorable properties. This is a description of the typical working fluid in a steam engine.\nThe answer: water", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the efficiency of a Rankine cycle is limited by the working fluid, specifically the temperature range it can operate over. This means that the cycle cannot reach supercritical levels for the working fluid. Therefore, the answer is: the working fluid. \nThe answer: working fluid", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 \u00b0C.\" This means that the turbine entry temperature of a steam turbine is 565 \u00b0C.\nThe answer: 565 \u00b0C", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that turbine entry temperatures in steam turbines are typically 565 \u00b0C, which is the creep limit of stainless steel. This means that stainless steel will start to deform under stress at this temperature. \nThe answer: stainless steel", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article compares the theoretical Carnot efficiency to the actual efficiency, implying that the theoretical efficiency is higher. Rule 3 applies because efficiency is a different concept than temperature. \nThe answer: about 63%", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"condenser temperatures are around 30 \u00b0C.\" This means that the condenser temperature is not very high. Therefore, we can infer that the temperature is not more than 30\u00b0C and is not very high compared to other temperatures mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: around 30\u00b0C", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that steam engines were the moving force behind the Industrial Revolution.\nThe answer: steam engines", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of steam engines being used on animals during the Industrial Revolution. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: steamboats", "{rule list: 5, 16}\nExplanation: Steam-powered automobiles are mentioned as \"even automobiles\" after farm tractors and motorcycles, so they come last in the list. This follows rule 16. Additionally, automobiles are a type of vehicle, while farm tractors and motorcycles are also vehicles, so rule 5 applies.\nThe answer: the Stanley Steamer", "{1, 3, 5}\nExplanation: Steam engines were used to drive machinery in factories, mills, and mines. (factories and mills are industrial locations, while mines are not) \nThe answer: factories and mills", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is related to any type of vehicle. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is related to any physical characteristic. Therefore, the answer must be related to the function or impact of steam engines in farming. \nThe answer: An increase in the land available for cultivation.", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that \"Catch Me Who Can\" is less successful than the Salamanca. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that \"Catch Me Who Can\" and \"Salamanca\" are different locomotives. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"Catch Me Who Can\" debuted before \"Salamanca\". \nThe answer: Catch Me Who Can", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the successful twin-cylinder locomotive Salamanca by Matthew Murray was used by the edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway.\" This means that Matthew Murray designed Salamanca.\nThe answer: Matthew Murray", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: twin-cylinder", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Middleton Railway", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that George Stephenson built a locomotive called the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. This is a clear example of a profession (locomotive builder) being associated with a specific project (building a locomotive for a railway). Additionally, the passage lists the Locomotion as a specific example of a locomotive built by Stephenson, which follows the rule that the first entity listed is referred to as \"former.\" \nThe answer: Stockton and Darlington Railway", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Arthur Woolf", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Arthur Woolf's nationality is a different concept from his invention or method, and therefore rule 4 applies. Additionally, his nationality is important for the answer, so rule 13 applies.\nThe answer: British", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that less heat is lost by the steam in each cylinder, which implies that the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling is decreased. Rule 3 applies because size (of the cylinders) is mentioned as a factor that is increased, but it is not the same concept as the one being decreased. \nThe answer: Magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying what needs to be increased to get the same work out of lower pressure steam. This relates to the concept of volume, which is covered by rule 3. Additionally, the question contains the phrase \"equal work\", which implies a comparison and therefore requires the application of rule 8. \nThe answer: cylinder volume", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: about 90%", "{rule list} \n1. animals and vehicles are different concepts\n2. if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\n\nExplanation: \nRule 1 is relevant because it establishes that marine engines and steam turbines are different concepts. Rule 2 is relevant because it states that if A is more efficient than B, then B is less efficient than A. \n\nThe answer: reciprocating steam engines", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the type of engines that have replaced steam engines for marine propulsion. Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 help us understand that different concepts such as animals, vehicles, professions, and nationalities are not interchangeable. Rule 9 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we can infer that reciprocating Diesel engines and gas turbines have overtaken steam propulsion for marine applications. \nThe answer: reciprocating Diesel engines and gas turbines", "{3, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"steam turbines with reduction gearing dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines.\" This means that reciprocating steam engines were used throughout most of the 20th century to propel ships.\nThe answer: reciprocating steam engines", "{rule list: 3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that steam turbines with reduction gearing dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century. This means that reduction gearing was used on steam turbine marine engines in the 20th century.\nThe answer: reduction gearing", "{3, 5, 9, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Rankine cycle as the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine, which utilizes the phase change of water to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. This is a description of the thermodynamic basis of the steam engine. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between size, shape, age, and color as different concepts, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 5 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and vehicles as different concepts, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 9 is relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is not relevant to the answer. Rule 23 is relevant because it explains that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: The Rankine cycle", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: In the Rankine cycle, waste heat is removed in a condenser. This is a passive sentence where \"waste heat\" is the subject and \"is removed\" is the verb. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is relevant to this question.\nThe answer: It is removed in a condenser.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1990s", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of \"plants\" referring to living organisms, and the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of \"plants\" referring to physical structures. Therefore, \"plants\" must refer to power plants. \nThe answer: biomass power plants", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of William Rankine cannot be inferred from his profession as a polymath. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can directly extract the answer from the article.\nThe answer: Scottish", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article compares the efficiency of different steam engine designs. Rule 3 applies because the article mentions a specific measure of efficiency called \"duty\" and how it was calculated. \nThe answer: by its \"duty\", which is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel of coal.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"numbers are different concepts\" applies, as duty is a numerical measure of energy efficiency. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies, as the passage states that Watt's low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17, indicating that 17 is more typical or average than 25. \nThe answer: 17", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Therefore, the ideal duty of a Newcomen engine is 7 million (since it is the highest possible value mentioned). \nThe answer: 7 million", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel (94 pounds) of coal.\" Therefore, the weight of a bushel of coal is 94 pounds.\nThe answer: 94", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 distinguishes between different concepts, including the concept of \"duty\" as a measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency. Rule 16 establishes that chronological information should be ordered correctly. Rule 23 explains the difference between active and passive sentences. \nThe answer: Watt", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is steam turbines. \nThe piston steam engines were replaced by steam turbines in power generation.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the type of steam engines being referred to. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" helps us understand that reciprocating piston type steam engines were the dominant source of power, meaning that other types of steam engines produced less power. \nThe answer: reciprocating piston type steam engines", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 9}\nExplanation: The rules eliminate any confusion between different concepts and ensure that antonyms are correctly interpreted. The answer: turbine type steam engines.", "1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 16\nExplanation: We need to identify the type of engines that replaced piston steam engines. Rule 1 tells us that if A is replaced by B, then B supersedes A. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about professions. Rule 5 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about animals. Rule 8 tells us that if A is replaced by B, then B is more antonym(replaced) than A. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can eliminate any information that comes after the answer. Therefore, the answer is: electric motors and steam turbines.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the first commercial steam-powered device was developed by Thomas Savery.\nThe answer: Thomas Savery", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that the first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump developed by Thomas Savery in 1698.\nThe answer: water pump", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article provides a chronological order of events, with the invention of the first commercial steam-powered device by Thomas Savery being the first event mentioned. The article also does not mention any other devices being invented before Savery's, making it clear that he was the first. \nThe answer: 1698", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses the development of the steam-powered water pump by Thomas Savery and its limitations. It then mentions an improvement made by Bento de Moura Portugal, which allowed the pump to work itself. This improvement is notable and mentioned specifically in the article. Gender, profession, and location are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Bento de Moura Portugal", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: John Smeaton", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Richard Trevithick and Oliver Evans separately introduced engines using high-pressure steam around 1800. However, it also states that Trevithick obtained a patent for his high-pressure engine in 1802. Therefore, the answer is Richard Trevithick.\nThe answer: Richard Trevithick", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Oliver Evans", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1802", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: High pressure steam engines were small enough for transport applications.\nThe answer: transport", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Steam engines were used as a power source.\nThe answer: power", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" does not apply here, and the rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" is not particularly relevant. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" to identify the company Energiprojekt AB as the relevant entity, and the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" to identify \"modern materials\" as the relevant characteristic. \nThe answer: Energiprojekt AB", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 applies because profession and company are different concepts. The rule 13 applies because names are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Sweden", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size and shape are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that the Energiprojekt AB engine is a single-step, 5-cylinder engine, meaning that it has 5 cylinders and they are all part of the same step or process.\nThe answer: 5", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3, which states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, is relevant because it clarifies that \"pounds\" and \"kilowatt hour\" are not related concepts. Rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, is also relevant because the question asks for the amount of steam per kilowatt hour, but the passage provides the amount of steam per kilogram. Therefore, the answer is not 8.8 pounds, but rather approximately 4 kilograms. \nThe answer: approximately 4 kilograms", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is rule 2, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. The article states that the efficiency of Energiprojekt's steam engine reaches some 27-30% on high-pressure engines, so we can say that the engine has achieved a high level of efficiency. Therefore, the answer is: 27-30%.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in power stations where CHP is not used, steam turbines use surface condensers as a cold sink. These condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and cooling towers. Therefore, the answer is water. \nThe answer: Water", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that a dry cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator in shape does not mean they are the same thing. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can use the word \"similar\" to find the answer. \nThe answer: An automobile radiator.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Dry cooling towers are used in locations where water is costly, as stated in the passage. \"Locations\" is a synonym for \"places.\" The use of \"dry\" is contrasted with \"evaporative (wet)\" cooling towers, indicating that they are different concepts, as per rule 3. \nThe answer: places where water is costly", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: \"Evaporative (wet) cooling towers\" is the type of cooling tower that uses the rejected heat to evaporate water. The question is asking for the name of this type of cooling tower, which is \"evaporative cooling tower.\"\nThe answer: evaporative", "{3, 8, 12}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific size or shape of the power plant is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a quantity comparison. The answer is given in the passage as \"a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling.\" \nThe answer: 3600", "{rule list: 1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Watt adopted the centrifugal governor for use on a steam engine in 1788, as stated in the article. This addition allowed for better handling of smaller variations in speed caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler, but could not hold a set speed and was not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning. Therefore, the answer is the centrifugal governor.", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that James Watt had a partner who saw the centrifugal governor at a flour mill they were building. The partner's name is not mentioned until later in the article, where it is revealed to be Boulton. \nThe answer: Boulton", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt\u2019s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building.\" This sentence follows the subject-verb-object structure, where \"Boulton\" is the subject, \"saw\" is the verb, and \"one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building\" is the object. The sentence is in the past tense, indicating that the observation happened in the past. Therefore, we can assume that Boulton observed the centrifugal governor at a flour mill that he and Watt were building.\nThe answer: At a flour mill that Boulton & Watt were building.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that engines equipped only with the centrifugal governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning. This means that the examine of work that a centrifugal governor-equipped steam engine wasn't suitable for is operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.\nThe answer: operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that the governor \"could not actually hold a set speed\" and \"engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed.\" Rule 3 applies because the question asks for what the governor was incapable of doing, which is a different concept than what it was able to handle. \nThe answer: holding a set speed", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that compounding was \"almost universal\" for marine engines after 1880, implying that before 1880 it was less common. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about marine engines, which may have different trends than other types of engines. \nThe answer: 1880", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that compounding was not universally popular in railway locomotives, which are machines. However, it was common for industrial units, road engines, and marine engines. Therefore, the answer is railway locomotives.\nThe answer: railway locomotives", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that compounding was often perceived as complicated in railway locomotives. This implies that it was seen as being more complex or difficult than other methods. \nThe answer: Complicated", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that compounding was not employed after 1930 is not relevant to the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Before what year was compounding used in Britain?\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that \"Britain\" refers to the United Kingdom. \nThe answer: 1930", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that compounding was common for industrial units and almost universal for marine engines after 1880. Therefore, the answer is: marine engines and industrial units. \nThe answer: marine engines and industrial units.", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for a synonym for \"shortening the admission event.\" Rule 2 states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. Therefore, \"shortening the admission event\" is the same as \"gradually shortening the cutoff.\" Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Therefore, \"shortening the cutoff\" is a valid answer.\nThe answer: shortening the cutoff", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a synonym of \"excessive compression.\" Rule 3 states that synonyms are not equivalent concepts, so we cannot assume that the answer will be a synonym of the phrase. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we should look for a phrase in the article that means the same thing as \"excessive compression.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we should pay attention to any negations in the article. The article mentions that \"excessive compression\" can result from a brief exhaust event that does not allow all of the exhaust steam to evacuate the cylinder, causing the cylinder to choke. Therefore, the answer is \"choking.\" \nThe answer: choking", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\nThe answer: evacuate the cylinder", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: fixed length", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont was an inventor who obtained the first patent for a steam engine in 1606. According to rule 4, profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that he was an inventor does not determine his nationality. However, according to rule 16, if two entities are listed, \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last. Therefore, since Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont is listed before Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen, he is the \"former\" and his nationality is relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Spanish", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont obtained the first patent for a steam engine, so we need to find the year he received the patent. The article also mentions Thomas Savery's patent in 1698 and Thomas Newcomen's use of a steam engine in 1712, so we can infer that Ayanz y Beaumont's patent must have been between those two years. Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that the answer is 1606, the year mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: 1606", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article provides a chronological order of the development of steam engines, with Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont obtaining the first patent in 1606, followed by Thomas Savery's patent for a steam pump in an unspecified year, and then Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine in 1712. Rule 16 indicates that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so Savery's patent must have been between 1606 and 1712. Rule 23 states that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we can identify the sentence \"Savery's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water\" as passive. Therefore, the answer is: Savery patented his steam pump in an unspecified year.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1712", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: \"Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" - this rule states that different concepts cannot be used interchangeably. \"Rotors\" is a term used to describe a specific component of a steam turbine, which falls under the concept of \"shape.\" Therefore, we cannot use a synonym for \"rotors\" that falls under a different concept.\nThe answer: There is no other term for rotors.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that \"rotors\" and \"stators\" are different concepts from \"blades\" and \"steam\". We use rule 16 to determine that \"rotors\" come before \"stators\". \nThe answer: a drive shaft", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Stators are a type of static disc fixed to the turbine casing. Since they are not rotating, they are the opposite of rotors. Therefore, stators can be referred to as \"static discs\" or \"non-rotating discs\".\nThe answer: static discs", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Stators are static discs fixed to the turbine casing.\nThe answer: Turbine casing", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power.\" This means that in the United States, a usual turbine speed with 60 Hertz of power is 3600 RPM.\nThe answer: 3600 RPM", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that the weight of boilers and condensers makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking for a comparison of the power-to-weight ratio of two different types of engines. \nThe answer: lower", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being any type of vehicle. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being any specific type of steam plant. Therefore, the answer is \"electric motors\". \nThe answer: electric motors", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The article mentions that most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so the answer is steam turbine plants.\nThe answer: Steam turbine plants.", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which mentions a \"renewed interest in steam\" known as the \"Advanced Steam movement.\" The rules of size, shape, age, and color, as well as profession and nationality, are not relevant to the answer. The question does not contain any synonyms or negations, so rules 7 and 17 are the most relevant. \nThe answer: Advanced Steam movement.", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how concerns about fuel sources and pollution have led to a renewed interest in steam power. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so it is relevant to note that the concern is not a lack of interest in steam power. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so it is relevant to note that the concern is not the absence of pollution. \nThe answer: pollution", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being a vehicle, and the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being a specific type of rotary engine. Therefore, the answer must be a general type of engine, which is a rotary engine. \nThe answer: Wankel engine", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that a pistonless rotary engine could replace an animal in a steam engine. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that a pistonless rotary engine could replace any of these aspects of a steam engine. Therefore, the answer is \"the cylinders and valve gear.\" \n\nThe answer: cylinders and valve gear", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the difficulty of sealing the rotors in a pistonless rotary engine is due to wear and thermal expansion. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"lack of expansive working\" is not the same as \"difficulty of sealing the rotors,\" so it is not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: thermal expansion", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Watt finished the development of his improvements to Newcomen's engine between 1763 and 1775.\nThe answer: between 1763 and 1775.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Watt improved Newcomen's engine by adding a separate condenser, which allowed it to use half as much coal as John Smeaton's improved version of Newcomen's. He also made the engine \"atmospheric\", powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam, instead of the pressure of expanding steam. \nThe answer: a separate condenser", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Watt's engine used half as much coal as Smeaton's improved version of Newcomen's engine.\nThe answer: half", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Newcomen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks about what air pressure pushes against in an atmospheric engine, which is the opposite of what is being pushed in a non-atmospheric engine. Therefore, the answer is: \"the piston\".", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two quantities (the number of mechanisms and the pressure in the boiler). Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts (the number of mechanisms and their design). \nThe answer: Two", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. The relevant rule is that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" The lever is restraining a plug valve in the top of a boiler.\nThe answer: a plug valve", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes two types of safety valves used in steam engines. The more recent type uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve that is locked to prevent tampering. Therefore, the answer is \"adjustable spring-loaded valve\". \nThe answer: adjustable spring-loaded valve", "{7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about what needs to be broken to allow an operator to tamper with an adjustable spring-loaded valve. Rule 7 and 8 are relevant because they state that synonyms and antonyms are important for the answer. Rule 17 is also relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is \"a seal\". \nThe answer: a seal", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes that if A is looking to generate more steam pressure than B, then B is looking to generate less steam pressure than A. Rule 8 applies because it establishes that if A fastened the safety valve down to generate more steam pressure, then B, who did not fasten the valve down, was looking to generate less steam pressure. \nThe answer: more power from the engine", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Corliss steam engine as the \"acme\" or ultimate development of the horizontal engine.\nThe answer: Corliss steam engine", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1849", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a comparison between the Corliss engine and the Watt engine in terms of steam usage. This is a comparison of two quantities, which falls under rule 1. The question also uses the word \"less,\" which is an antonym, falling under rule 8.\nThe answer: 30% less steam.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The Corliss steam engine was a four-valve counter flow engine. \nThe answer: Four.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Corliss was given the Rumford medal.\nThe answer: Rumford medal", "{3, 4, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the development of thermodynamic theory and its relationship to the steam engine. The answer to the question is that thermodynamic theory received contributions from the steam engine.\nThe answer: thermodynamics", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Watt", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Watt's measurements on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. \nThe answer: The separate condenser.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Joseph Black confirmed Watt's discovery of latent heat and also advised him on experimental procedures.\nThe answer: Joseph Black", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a concept that was discovered independently by Watt and originally by Black. Rule 3 states that concepts are different from each other, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The concept in question is latent heat, which was discovered independently by Watt and originally by Black. Therefore, the answer is \"latent heat\".", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The Rankine cycle requires relatively little work to drive the pump during the compression stage because the working fluid is in its liquid phase at this point. This contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. \nThe answer: relatively little work is required to drive the pump during the compression stage", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is in a certain state more than B, then B is in that state less than A. In this case, the article states that during the compression stage of the Rankine cycle, relatively little work is required to drive the pump because the working fluid is in its liquid phase at this point. Therefore, the working fluid is in a liquid state during the compression stage. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: liquid", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine power.\" This means that relatively little turbine power is consumed by the pump during the condensation of the working fluid.\nThe answer: 1% to 3% of the turbine power", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that gas turbines have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 \u00b0C, which is a specific temperature range and not a comparison to another temperature. Therefore, rule 3 applies to differentiate between temperature and other concepts, and rule 8 applies to handle the comparison between gas turbines and other types of turbines. \nThe answer: 1500 \u00b0C", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that pumps, such as an injector, are a component often present in boilers. This fits with rule 3, which states that different concepts (such as pumps and boilers) should not be confused, and rule 7, which allows for synonyms to be used in the question. \nThe answer: injector", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that condensers are used to recirculate water and recover the latent heat of vaporisation. \nThe answer: recover the latent heat of vaporisation", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The article mentions \"superheaters\" as the component that raises the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapor point. This falls under rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5, which states that animals and vehicles are different concepts.\nThe answer: superheaters", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions that a coal supply bin is also called a \"bunker.\"\nThe answer: bunker", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The passage states that land-based steam engines could exhaust much of their steam because feed water was usually readily available.\nThe answer: feed water", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the inventor is not related to their profession. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we can assume that the inventor is male.\nThe answer: The article does not provide information about the nationality of the inventor of the steam turbine.", "{rule list: 3, 5, 15}\nExplanation: The passage states that the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential, but was superseded by the steam turbine in warships where speed was required. The HMS Dreadnought, a major warship, was the first to use the steam turbine. \nThe answer: dreadnought battleships", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential, implying that there were other types of ships that required high speeds. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that the type of ship is a different concept from the engine used. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so we can infer that ships and warships are different concepts. \nThe answer: ocean liners", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that HMS Dreadnought was the first major warship to use steam turbine technology, replacing the reciprocating engine. This implies that it was launched after the invention of the steam turbine, which was in the early 20th century. The passage also mentions that the ship was launched in 1905. Therefore, the answer is:\nThe year 1905.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that nuclear power plants heat water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the specific thing that is heated, which is water.\nThe answer: water", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. These rules help us understand that the answer to the question is not related to the physical characteristics of the steam, but rather what it drives. \nThe answer: a turbine connected to an electrical generator.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and animals and vehicles are different concepts.\nThe answer: an electrical generator", "{3, 5, 12}\nExplanation: The passage discusses different methods of using steam to generate power, including in nuclear power plants and in ships/submarines. It also briefly mentions the use of steam in railroad locomotives, but notes that it was not successful. The specific term mentioned in the passage is \"turbo-electric transmission,\" which refers to the use of a steam turbine to drive a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors. \nThe answer: turbo-electric transmission", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. The passage mentions that some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives had success for express passenger work in Britain. Names and locations are equally important for the answer. Some irrelevant information is included in the passage. \nThe answer: Britain", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: practical Carnot cycle", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: Heat rejection occurs in the condenser in the Rankine cycle, which is a constant pressure process. This is in contrast to the Carnot cycle, where heat rejection occurs isothermally. Therefore, rule 3 applies to differentiate between the two cycles, rule 9 applies to understand the relationship between the two processes, and rule 16 applies to understand the order of events in the cycle. \nThe answer: in the condenser", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: \"isobaric\" is a term used to describe a constant pressure process. This falls under rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: constant pressure", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that in the theoretical Carnot cycle, heat addition and rejection are isothermal processes, meaning they occur at constant temperature. \nThe answer: isothermal", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the state of the working fluid in the condenser in the Rankine cycle. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the Carnot cycle has isothermal heat addition and rejection, then the Rankine cycle has isobaric heat addition and rejection. Therefore, the working fluid is received in liquid form in the condenser. \nThe answer: liquid", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8.\nThe answer: 8", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. Therefore, the answer is helium.\nThe answer: helium", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: two", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.\nThe answer: almost half", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that oxygen is colorless and odorless is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if oxygen makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere, then the other gases make up 79.2%. Therefore, the answer is: dioxygen (O2).", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe answer: 20.8%", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that oxygen is part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, which makes up almost half of the Earth's crust's mass. Therefore, the answer is oxygen.\nThe answer: oxygen", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8.\nThe answer: 8", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the trend in atmospheric oxygen levels, which implies a change over time. Therefore, rules 17 and 18, which state that negations are important for the answer and that negations in the question are important for the answer, are relevant. \nThe answer: down", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison of abundance between three elements. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the concept of abundance, which is different from size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: hydrogen, helium, and oxygen", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 8", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that oxygen is a nonmetal and oxidizing agent is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if oxygen is a member of the chalcogen group, then it is not a member of any other group. \nThe answer: chalcogen group", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen most commonly forms compounds, notably oxides, with most elements.\nThe answer: oxides", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. (rule 3: size, shape, age, and color are different concepts; rule 8: if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B) \nThe answer: third-most", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that oxygen is a colorless and odorless gas is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if two atoms of oxygen form dioxygen, then under normal conditions, they form a diatomic gas. \nThe answer: a diatomic gas", "{3, 24}\nExplanation: Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis. In an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, so \"oxygen\" is the subject and \"released\" is the verb. Therefore, the answer is \"photosynthesis\". \nThe answer: photosynthesis", "{3, 5, 17}\nExplanation: Oxygen is produced from water through photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight. The answer is: sunlight.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Oxygen in the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation. The question asks for what helps protect the biosphere from UV, so we need to identify the relevant concept (protection from UV) and the relevant entity (what provides that protection). The answer is ozone. \nThe answer: ozone", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that different concepts such as size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles are not interchangeable. Therefore, we can infer that the answer to the question is not related to any of these concepts. The passage mentions that many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen, making it the element found in most organic organisms.\nThe answer: oxygen", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: Oxygen is found in many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats. Therefore, it is a significant component of the mass of living organisms. However, it is important to note that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: organic molecules", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Oxygen is produced by photosynthesis in the presence of light.\nThe answer: photosynthesis", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that oxygen is a constituent of water, which is used in photosynthesis. Rule 16 states that the information relevant to the answer comes before the information about the ozone layer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: water", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Oxygen in the form of ozone (O3) is composed of three oxygen atoms.\nThe answer: ozone", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two things (air and combustion) and allows us to infer that if air is necessary for combustion, then the absence of air would prevent combustion. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between concepts, such as air and combustion, and prevents us from confusing them with each other.\nThe answer: Robert Boyle", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion, but Mayow refined this by showing that only a part of air, which he called nitroaereus, is needed for fire. The answer is John Mayow.\nThe answer: John Mayow", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for something that is consumed in both combustion and respiration. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse concepts, so we need to focus on the concept that is common to both processes. Rule 8 tells us that if something is consumed in both A and B, then it is the antonym of something that is more in A than in B. Therefore, the answer is \"nitroaereus\".", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year of John Mayow's death, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the year of his death will come after his name. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to look for a sentence that mentions his death. \nThe answer: 1679", "{1, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion, so he is the researcher who showed this.\nThe answer: Robert Boyle", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name given by John Mayow to the part of air that causes combustion. This information is directly stated in the passage. \nThe answer: nitroaereus", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a time period, which can be answered by identifying the time frame mentioned in the article. The article states that Mayow and Boyle performed their experiments in the late 17th century. This answer is supported by rule 16, which states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" and rule 23, which states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb.\"\nThe answer: late 17th century", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Mayow showed that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion, so it is responsible for both actions.\nThe answer: respiration", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: John Mayow showed that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus.\nThe answer: John Mayow", "{rule list: 1, 3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the author of \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was published in 1775. The answer is Joseph Priestley, a British clergyman who conducted an experiment in which he focused sunlight on mercuric oxide and discovered a gas he named \"dephlogisticated air\". He published his findings in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air.", "{rule list: 4, 13, 19}\nExplanation: Joseph Priestley's occupation is mentioned in the article, which falls under rule 13. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the question does not ask for his nationality. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession.\nThe answer: British clergyman", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about an experiment conducted by Joseph Priestley involving mercuric oxide. The question asks for the symbol for mercuric oxide, which is a chemical concept and falls under rule 3. Additionally, the question does not require any information about names or locations, so rule 13 is also relevant. \nThe answer: HgO", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: mercuric oxide (HgO)", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between the chemical used and other possible chemicals. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that the chemical used is a different concept from other possible concepts mentioned in the passage. Rule 13 is relevant because it establishes that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: mercuric oxide (HgO)", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name given by Priestley to the gas he discovered. Rule 3 states that concepts such as color and shape are different, so the name of the gas is not a color or a shape. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"name\" or \"discover\" in the passage. The answer is \"dephlogisticated air\". \nThe answer: dephlogisticated air", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1775", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 13, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if Priestley is given credit for discovering oxygen, then others who may have discovered it before him are considered to have discovered it less than he did. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about oxygen, which is a different concept from other gases that may have been discovered before it. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about credit for discovery, which is a different concept from nationality or profession. Rule 8 applies because Priestley is given credit for discovering oxygen, which means that others who may have discovered it before him are considered to have discovered something else. Rule 13 applies because the question asks about credit for discovery, which means that names are important for the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about why Priestley is given credit, which means that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Because he published his findings first.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, as are profession and nationality. Therefore, the fact that the mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing the gas is the relevant information. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing the gas, so it can be inferred that it was less active and had a shorter lifespan while breathing normal air. \nThe answer: The mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing the gas.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Leonardo da Vinci", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the Greek writer who wrote Pneumatica. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the writer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: Philo of Byzantium", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The article does not provide a specific year for the first known experiments on combustion and air, but it does mention that the experiments were conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. Therefore, we can infer that the experiments were conducted sometime in the 2nd century BCE.\nThe answer: 2nd century BCE", "{rule list: 8, 17}\nExplanation: Philo of Byzantium did not correctly surmise that air converted to fire.\nThe answer: did not", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Philo of Byzantium", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Philo incorrectly assumed that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass.\nThe answer: the classical element fire", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the title of Philo's work, which is a specific piece of information mentioned in the passage. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) and rule 13 (names are equally important) are relevant. The answer is \"Pneumatica\". \nThe answer: Pneumatica", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work, indicating that he further investigated Philo's experiments. The use of \"many centuries later\" implies a significant time gap between Philo and da Vinci, so rule 13 is relevant to ensure that the time gap is not ignored. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains the negation \"incorrectly,\" indicating that the answer should be the opposite of what Philo believed. \nThe answer: Leonardo da Vinci", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a portion of air", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Combustion requires an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, to trigger it. (rule 3) Additionally, combustion occurs when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity. (rule 8) \nThe answer: an ignition event, such as heat or a spark", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion. Therefore, oxygen plays a crucial role in combustion as the oxidant. According to rule 3, it is important to differentiate between concepts such as fuel and oxidant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, so it is important to clarify its role in combustion. \nThe answer: Oxygen is the oxidant in combustion.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, since the passage mentions peroxides, nitrates, and dichromates as examples of compounds with a high oxidative potential, we can infer that they are examples of oxidants. \nThe answer: oxidants", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is not a fuel, but it is the oxidant that generates the most occurrence of explosions. Therefore, the answer is oxygen.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Heat or a spark is needed to trigger combustion, meaning they are important for the progress of a fire.\nThe answer: Heat or a spark is needed to trigger combustion.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel.\nThe answer: the oxidant", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Concentrated oxygen can produce rapid combustion.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion.\nThe answer: the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for \"other sources\" of high oxidative potential, implying that oxygen is already a source. Therefore, the answer should be something that is not oxygen. \nThe answer: peroxides, chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, and dichromates", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses how concentrated O2 can act as a fuel and cause rapid combustion. The Apollo 1 disaster is mentioned as an example of this, where the capsule was pressurized with pure O2, leading to a fire that killed the crew. Rule 3 states that elements and chemicals are different concepts, so we can infer that the answer is not \"oxygen\" but rather \"O2\", which is the chemical formula for oxygen. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the cause of the disaster was not the lack of oxygen but rather the excess of it. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can infer that the answer is not \"what chemical element was present\" but rather \"what chemical element was the cause\". \nThe answer: O2", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that concentrated O2 can cause combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically, and that both gaseous and liquid oxygen can act as a fuel. It also mentions the Apollo 1 fire caused by pure O2 at slightly more than atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the answer is that oxygen in both liquid and gas form can result in an explosion.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the fire in the Apollo 1 capsule spread rapidly because it was pressurized with pure O2 at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the 1/3 normal pressure that would be used in a mission. Therefore, to ensure safety of future space missions, oxygen was used at 1/3 of the normal pressure.\nThe answer: 1/3", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the dangers of handling pure oxygen and the need for special precautions to prevent combustion. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is relevant because the question asks for the opposite of combustion. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because the question asks for what is required to reduce the chances of combustion. \nThe answer: a non-combustible material or substance", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that \"Concentrated O2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically.\" Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the effect of concentrated oxygen, which is a different concept than the steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit it. \nThe answer: combustion", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size and concentration are different concepts, and the question asks about the danger of concentrated oxygen. The use of \"because of the danger inherent\" indicates a negation, making rule 17 relevant. The answer is: minimizing ignition sources.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is highly combustible and can act as a fuel, so special precautions must be taken to minimize ignition sources when designing and manufacturing oxygen systems. This includes using steel pipes and storage vessels that are specially designed to prevent ignition. The Apollo 1 fire was caused by the use of pure oxygen at a pressure higher than normal, which allowed the fire to spread rapidly. Therefore, the transport and storage of oxygen demand safety measures to prevent ignition sources. \nThe answer: Special precautions to minimize ignition sources.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Apollo 1 crew", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that granite is a type of rock is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we rephrase the question as \"What chemical compound is the main component of granite?\", we can use the fact that granite is composed of oxides of silicon (silica SiO2) to answer the question.\nThe answer: Silica (SiO2)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, the answer is \"carbon dioxide\".", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it helps us identify that the missing word is a noun that comes after \"Earth's\". The answer is \"mantle\". \nThe answer: mantle", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the form in which oxygen is present in the atmosphere. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" helps us understand that if oxygen is present in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide, then carbon dioxide is present in larger quantities than oxygen. \nThe answer: carbon dioxide (CO2)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Earth's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon, aluminum, iron, and calcium carbonate. Therefore, the answer is crustal rock.\nThe answer: crustal rock", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Earth's mantle is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.\nThe answer: mantle", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from profession and nationality, so rule 3 applies. The question asks about a comparison between two parts of the Earth's geological structure, so rule 16 applies. The answer: the mantle.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can't assume that compounds are included based on their size or shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if oxides comprise a large portion of the Earth's crust, then non-oxides must comprise a smaller portion. Therefore, the answer is: various complex silicates.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Dalton assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. This means that he believed that all elements were present in compounds in a 1:1 ratio. However, this assumption was later proven incorrect by Gay-Lussac and Humboldt, who showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen. Therefore, the answer is that John Dalton thought that all elements were present in compounds in a 1:1 ratio.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Dalton assumed that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, which gave the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. Therefore, Dalton's formula for water was erroneous.\nThe answer: HO", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the element that is present in twice the amount of oxygen in water. Rule 3 tells us that elements are different concepts from ratios or compositions. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, Dalton assumed that the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, but Gay-Lussac and von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen. Therefore, we can infer that the atomic mass of hydrogen is half that of oxygen. Finally, rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for the element that is present in twice the amount of oxygen, so we need to negate this to get the element that is present in half the amount of oxygen. \nThe answer: hydrogen", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the theory that presented the assumption of diatomic molecules, which is mentioned in the passage as \"the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.\" The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 9 (antonyms), and 16 (first and last). \nThe answer: Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: According to the article, \"Highly combustible materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston.\" This means that materials that left little residue were thought to contain phlogiston.\nThe answer: phlogiston", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Combustible materials that leave little residue were considered to have little phlogiston. This is an example of rule 1, where if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. It also applies rule 3, where size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Wood or coal.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Combustion was observed to make objects lighter, but the fact that some substances, like wood, actually gain weight in burning was not accounted for in phlogiston theory. This contradicts the idea that combustion involves the release of a substance (phlogiston) from the burning material. Therefore, the distinct quality of combustion absent from phlogiston theory is the fact that some substances gain weight in burning. \nThe answer: The fact that some substances gain weight in burning.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The phlogiston theory believed that combustible materials like wood or coal were made mostly of phlogiston, while non-combustible substances like iron contained very little. However, it was observed that metals gain weight in rusting, which contradicts the theory. Therefore, the answer is metals. \nThe answer: metals", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that according to phlogiston theory, most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process of burning. Therefore, the answer is that most items display a decrease in weight or become lighter after burning. \nThe answer: decrease in weight or become lighter", "{rule list: 3, 8, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Dioxygen is described as a covalent double bond resulting from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms, with a bond order of two. This is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy filling of orbitals, including \u03c3 and \u03c0 overlap of atomic 2p orbitals. Negations are important to note, as the question asks for the \"most simple\" description. \nThe answer: as a covalent double bond", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for the bond order, which is a measure of the strength of the bond between the two oxygen atoms. The answer is \"two.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a descriptive term for a bond that is formed through sequential, low-to-high energy filling of orbitals. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so these concepts are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that a high-to-low energy bond is the antonym of a low-to-high energy bond. Therefore, the answer is a high-to-low energy bond. \nThe answer: high-to-low energy bond.", "{3}\nExplanation: The two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other through a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms. \nThe answer: through a covalent double bond", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the cause of the covalent double bond mentioned in the passage. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 8, on the other hand, states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is applicable here. The passage states that the covalent double bond results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms, which can be described as a covalent double bond with a bond order of two. Therefore, the answer is: the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1773 or earlier", "{1, 10, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if one person discovered oxygen before the other, then the other person recognized it after the first. Rule 10 is relevant because it states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, and \"recognize\" is a synonym for \"discover.\" Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: 1774", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: his work was published first", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the researcher who first used the word \"oxygen\", and the passage mentions that Antoine Lavoisier coined the term. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a concept (the word \"oxygen\") and the passage mentions other concepts such as the discovery of oxygen and its uses. Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a specific name mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: Antoine Lavoisier", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 distinguishes between different concepts, including theories and elements. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the phlogiston theory was discredited by Lavoisier's experiments with oxygen, so the answer is the phlogiston theory. Rule 17 emphasizes the importance of negations in the question, as it asks for the theory that was discredited, not the theory that was proven. \nThe answer: phlogiston theory", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the term used to describe the arrangement of two unpaired electrons in dioxygen. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate those as potential rules. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can use this rule to determine that the term for the arrangement of two unpaired electrons in dioxygen is a spin triplet state. \nThe answer: spin triplet state", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the O2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen in its ground state, then it is not referred to as singlet oxygen. \nThe answer: triplet oxygen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that triplet oxygen has unpaired electrons, which makes it a spin triplet state. This means that it reacts slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins. Therefore, the answer is the unpaired electrons in triplet oxygen. \nThe answer: unpaired electrons", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: The slow reaction of triplet oxygen, which has unpaired electrons, prevents spontaneous combustion with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins. This is because the partially filled antibonding orbitals weaken the bond order from three to two, making the molecule less reactive. Therefore, the answer is spontaneous combustion. \nThe answer: spontaneous combustion", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The weakly filled higher orbitals of oxygen are antibonding orbitals. The filling of these orbitals weakens the bond order from three to two. This means that the bond between the two oxygen atoms is weaker and more reactive. Since these orbitals have unpaired electrons, oxygen in this state is referred to as a spin triplet state. This means that it reacts slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins. \nThe answer: antibonding orbitals", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Lavoisier observed that part of the trapped air had been consumed during combustion and that the tin had increased in weight by the same amount as the weight of the air that rushed back in. He concluded that air is a mixture of two gases, one of which is essential to combustion and respiration, and the other which did not support either. Therefore, he concluded that the gas consumed during combustion was the \"vital air\" or oxygen. \nThe answer: \"vital air\" or oxygen", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Lavoisier heated tin and air in a closed container and observed that air rushed in when he opened the container, indicating that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This means that the tin gained weight by combining with oxygen from the air, which is the opposite of losing weight. Therefore, the answer is: the weight of the tin increased.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that Lavoisier observed that the tin had increased in weight and the air had been consumed, indicating that the air had lost weight as much as the tin had gained weight. Rule 3 applies because weight and consumption are different concepts. \nThe answer: weight", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the year of publication, which is a time-related concept. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific year, which is a chronological order. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the word \"in\" which is a negation. \nThe answer: 1777.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the part of air that did not support combustion or respiration, which means it was deemed \"lifeless\" by Lavoisier. Rule 3 tells us that different concepts, such as \"vital air\" and \"azote,\" should be treated as separate entities. Rule 8 tells us that if one entity is more or less of a certain quality than another entity, then the opposite is true for the other entity. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is \"azote,\" which later became known as nitrogen. \nThe answer: Azote", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: O3 is usually known as ozone.\nThe answer: ozone", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that ozone is a reactive allotrope of oxygen means that it is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if ozone is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen, then oxygen is a less reactive allotrope than ozone. \nThe answer: oxygen", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Ozone is damaging to lung tissue.\nThe answer: lung tissue", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. This means that the fact that ozone is damaging to lung tissue is not relevant to the function it performs for the planet. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the ozone layer functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet, which means that it is protecting the planet from harmful UV radiation. Therefore, the answer is: The ozone layer functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: This question is asking for a specific type of radiation that ozone absorbs. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as potential answers. The relevant concept here is radiation, which is distinct from profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is UV radiation.\nThe answer: UV", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for the \"most common\" form of oxygen, which implies that there are other forms of oxygen that are less common. Therefore, the answer is \"dioxygen.\" \nThe answer: dioxygen.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that oxygen is a gas is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that O2 is the common allotrope of elemental oxygen, then we can infer that the scientific designation of oxygen is simply \"oxygen\". \nThe answer: oxygen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that dioxygen (O2) is a major part of the Earth's atmosphere. The use of the word \"major\" implies that oxygen is not the only component of the Earth's atmosphere, so rule 3 applies. Additionally, the question uses the phrase \"part of,\" which is synonymous with \"comprised of,\" so rule 8 also applies.\nThe answer: Oxygen is a major part of the Earth's atmosphere.", "3, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if oxygen is necessary to life, then the lack of oxygen is harmful to life. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can infer that the answer is related to the absence of a certain characteristic of oxygen. \nThe answer: Its energy content.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if oxygen is used for a certain purpose by animals, then animals cannot survive without it. Rule 3 applies because the purpose of oxygen is different from its bond length or energy. \nThe answer: Oxygen is used by animals in cellular respiration.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen to study.\" This indicates that James Dewar is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: James Dewar", "{rule list: 1, 10, 12}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the time when Dewar produced liquid oxygen to the time when Linde and Hampson developed a commercially viable process for producing it. Rule 10 applies because the question contains a typo (\"experiemnt\" instead of \"experiment\"). Rule 12 applies because the passage contains information that is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: 1891", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Liquid oxygen was first developed for commercial use in 1895 by German engineer Carl von Linde and British engineer William Hampson.\nThe answer: 1895", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: oxyacetylene welding", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison between two components. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves different concepts. \nThe answer: Oxygen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the chemical characteristic that affects oxygen's solubility in water. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that nitrogen is less soluble in water than oxygen. Therefore, the answer is that oxygen's solubility in water is dependent on its chemical characteristic.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if seawater contains about 4.95 mL of oxygen per liter, then freshwater contains more than 4.95 mL of oxygen per liter. Therefore, the answer is approximately 6.04 milliliters (mL) of oxygen per liter of freshwater under normal conditions.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent, with about twice as much dissolving at 0\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C. It also states that freshwater contains about 6.04 mL of oxygen per liter at 25\u00b0C, whereas seawater contains about 4.95 mL per liter. Therefore, the answer is seawater.\nThe answer: seawater", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the solubility of oxygen to nitrogen. Rule 3 applies because it compares the solubility of oxygen at different temperatures. \nThe answer: twice as much (14.6 mg\u00b7L\u22121)", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the ranking of oxygen compared to other elements in the biosphere. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the concept of mass. \nThe answer: Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's biosphere.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the abundance of oxygen by mass in the Earth's biosphere, air, sea, and land is a separate concept from its abundance in the universe. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe after hydrogen and helium, then it is less abundant than those two elements. \nThe answer: third most abundant", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is compared to other chemical elements in terms of abundance, which falls under rule 3. The question asks for a quantitative comparison, which falls under rule 8.\nThe answer: About 0.9% of the Sun's mass is oxygen.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is a major component of the Earth's crust by mass and the major component of the world's oceans by mass.\nThe answer: Earth's crust and world's oceans", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about the abundance of oxygen on other planets is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Earth has a high concentration of oxygen in its atmosphere, then Mars and Venus have a low concentration. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that oxygen is not produced from carbon dioxide on other planets is relevant. \nThe answer: Oxygen is not produced from carbon dioxide on other planets.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Researchers realized that air could be liquefied by the late 19th century.\nThe answer: late 19th century", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that air was liquefied by compressing and cooling it. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the means used to liquefy air, which is a different concept than the components of air. \nThe answer: by compressing and cooling it", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a scientist who announced the discovery of liquid oxygen to the French Academy of Sciences. Rule 1 applies because it establishes that if A announced something before B, then B did it after A. Rule 2 applies because it establishes that if A discovered something and B discovered something else related to it, then A is the most related to the discovery. Rule 13 applies because it establishes that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Raoul Pierre Pictet", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: only a few drops", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: March 29, 1883", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Sun", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen isotopes are different concepts, and the question asks for a comparison of their proportions. The use of \"higher\" implies a comparison of quantity, which is a concept that follows rule 3. The use of \"than\" implies a comparison, which is a concept that follows rule 8.\nThe answer: Oxygen-16", "{rule list: 13, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the spacecraft that contained data to determine the oxygen content of the Sun. The answer can be found in the passage, which states that the data was obtained from a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft. Therefore, the relevant rules are 13 (names are equally important for the answer), 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). \nThe answer: Genesis spacecraft", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an unknown process", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Sun lost oxygen-16 before the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth. Therefore, the answer is the Earth. \nThe answer: Earth", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a form of oxygen in which electrons are paired, which is described in the article as singlet oxygen. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as size, shape, age, and color, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is also relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if singlet oxygen is a form of oxygen in which electrons are paired, then molecular oxygen per se is a form of oxygen in which electrons are unpaired. \nThe answer: singlet oxygen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Singlet oxygen is more reactive towards common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se. (rule 3) This is because singlet oxygen is a higher-energy species of molecular O2 in which all the electron spins are paired. (rule 3) \nThe answer: common organic molecules", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: photosynthesis", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Singlet oxygen is produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength.\nThe answer: photolysis of ozone by short wavelength light", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms (and possibly also in animals) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues. This means that carotenoids are used to prevent harm from singlet oxygen. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. This means that if we know that carotenoids absorb singlet oxygen, we can infer that without carotenoids, singlet oxygen would cause harm to tissues. Therefore, the answer is carotenoids. \nThe answer: carotenoids", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine past climates.\nThe answer: paleoclimatologists", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about the \"weather feature\" that paleoclimatologists want information on. Rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and weather is not any of those. Rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks about what paleoclimatologists want to know, and the passage explains that they measure the ratio of oxygen isotopes to determine what the climate was like millions of years ago. Therefore, the answer is \"climate.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \n\nThe answer: climate", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the weight of the isotopes is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if oxygen-18 is 12% heavier than oxygen-16, then oxygen-16 is 12% lighter than oxygen-18. \nThe answer: 12%", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the opposite relationship between two concepts (warmer vs cooler climate). Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts (types of oxygen). \nThe answer: oxygen-18", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If seawater is higher in oxygen-18, it means that there was a period of lower global temperatures. This follows rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. It also follows rule 3, which states that oxygen-18 levels are a different concept from other factors that may affect climate. \nThe answer: lower global temperatures", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify the wavelength at which the spectrophotometric absorption bands of oxygen peak. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information related to these concepts. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use it to infer that if the absorption band peaks at a certain wavelength, then it is less at other wavelengths. Therefore, the answer is: 687 and 760 nm.", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Measuring radiance from vegetation in the spectrophotometric absorption bands of 687 and 760 nm can provide information about the plant health status. \nThe answer: plant health status", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Scientists would like to measure vegetation radiance from a satellite platform.\nThe answer: satellite platform", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article discusses using spectrophotometric absorption bands to measure the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in order to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This method has been proposed as a possible way to monitor the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale. Therefore, the scale on which scientists would show measurements of vegetation is a global scale.\nThe answer: global", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Scientists like to use spectrophotometric absorption bands to measure radiance from vegetation canopies.\nThe answer: spectrophotometric absorption bands", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the magnetic character of triplet O2, implying that there may be other forms of O2 with different magnetic characters. Rule 3 applies because the question specifically asks about the magnetic character, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: paramagnetic", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because the question asks for an element, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because the question asks for what element can be built between poles of a magnet, implying that the element is attracted to the magnet. Therefore, the answer is oxygen.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that the magnetic character of oxygen in the presence of a magnetic field is due to the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule. This means that the spin of the unpaired electrons produces a magnetic effect. \nThe answer: unpaired electrons", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that oxygen molecules are paramagnetic in the presence of a magnetic field. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the type of field is not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer is a magnetic field. \nThe answer: magnetic", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the magnetic properties of oxygen in the presence of a magnetic field and how liquid oxygen can be attracted to a magnet. Rule 3 states that shape and physical properties are different concepts, so the fact that liquid oxygen can form a bridge is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms, so \"device\" can be replaced with \"instrument\" or \"tool\". Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored. \nThe answer: magnet", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the result of the reactive oxygen species in organisms. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the answer should not include the concept of \"organisms\" itself. \nThe answer: dangerous by-products", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that reactive oxygen species are dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms, implying that organisms make them involuntarily. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the purpose of making peroxide and superoxide, which are different concepts from the organisms themselves.\nThe answer: To destroy invading microbes.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that reactive oxygen species play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack.\nThe answer: plant pathogens", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on Earth until O2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event, about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms.\nThe answer: obligately anaerobic organisms", "{rule list: 3, 8, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that \"Oxygen condenses at 90.20 K (\u2212182.95 \u00b0C, \u2212297.31 \u00b0F)\" which implies that other substances can be compared to it in terms of temperature. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about the temperature at which oxygen condenses, which is a different concept from its color or production method.\nThe answer: 90.20 K", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that both liquid and solid O2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color. The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the clarity of a substance is not related to its color. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if liquid oxygen is clear, it is not opaque. \nThe answer: clear", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that high-purity liquid O2 is obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air. \nThe answer: liquefied air", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: \"Element\" refers to a chemical element, which is different from a substance or a material. \"Coolant\" refers to a substance used to cool something down. The passage states that liquid nitrogen is used as a coolant in the process of making liquid oxygen. \nThe answer: nitrogen", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Oxygen is a highly reactive substance, so it must be segregated from combustible materials.\nThe answer: combustible materials", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks where free oxygen is found, and the article mentions that free oxygen occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. Therefore, the answer is: in the world's water bodies.", "{2, 3}\nExplanation: O2 is more soluble at lower temperatures.\nThe answer: at lower temperatures", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content, then non-polar oceans support a much lower density of life due to their lower oxygen content. Therefore, the answer is that polar water bodies support a higher amount of life due to their higher oxygen content.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" and the rule that \"negations are important for the answer.\" The question asks what will be encouraged by pollution of water by nitrates and phosphates, which can be rephrased as what will grow due to this pollution. The answer is algae. \nThe answer: Algae", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how scientists measure the quality of water by measuring its biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of O2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that negations are important for the answer is also not relevant. \nThe answer: Biochemical oxygen demand", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent before photosynthetic organisms evolved. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the evolution of photosynthetic organisms, which is a different concept than the presence of free oxygen gas. Rule 16 applies because the article provides a timeline of events. \nThe answer: probably about 3.5 billion years ago", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so we can ignore the mention of specific time periods. Rule 16 states that we should prioritize answering questions about the first or last items mentioned in a list, so we can focus on the mention of the Paleoproterozoic eon. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can note that the question asks about when free oxygen \"began appearing in quantity,\" implying that it was not present in significant amounts before that time. \nThe answer: Paleoproterozoic eon.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the answer can be found by applying rule 3 to understand that oxygen and iron are different concepts, and then applying rule 8 to understand that if oxygen is produced by organisms and combines with iron, then the resulting compound is not oxygen, but rather iron oxide. Therefore, the answer is iron oxide. \nThe answer: banded iron formations", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from size and shape means that we can't assume that the time period for oxygen reaching 10% of its present level is related to any other time period mentioned in the article. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, means that if oxygen reached 10% of its present level 1.7 billion years ago, then it was less than 10% of its present level before that time. \nThe answer: 1.7 billion years ago", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so any information about the age of oxygen in the oceans is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3-2.7 billion years ago, which means that before that time, oxygen was not in the atmosphere. Therefore, the answer is \"3-2.7 billion years ago\".", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the high concentration of oxygen on Earth is due to the oxygen cycle, which is driven by photosynthesis. This means that the production of oxygen through photosynthesis is greater than its consumption through respiration and decay, leading to high levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. \nThe answer: photosynthesis", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" is also not relevant. The relevant rule is that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X.\" The oxygen cycle is a biogeochemical cycle, which means it involves the movement of elements between living and non-living components of the Earth's system. Therefore, the answer is: a biogeochemical cycle.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the oxygen cycle involves three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere.\nThe answer: three", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the high concentration of oxygen on Earth is due to the oxygen cycle, which involves the movement of oxygen between the atmosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere. The driving factor of this cycle is photosynthesis, which releases oxygen into the atmosphere. Therefore, the answer is photosynthesis.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Oxygen", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage describes two methods of producing oxygen, one of which involves passing air through zeolite molecular sieves to absorb nitrogen and deliver a gas stream that is mostly oxygen. The answer is pressure swing adsorption. \nThe answer: Pressure swing adsorption.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant because they help us understand that the question is asking for the percentage of oxygen produced by a zeolite sieve, which is a specific method of producing oxygen and not a characteristic of oxygen itself. \nThe answer: 90% to 93%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is relevant as it helps us understand that the zeolite sieve is not an animal or a vehicle. Rule 8 is also relevant as it helps us understand that if a zeolite sieve absorbs nitrogen while producing oxygen, then nitrogen is the antonym of oxygen. \nThe answer: nitrogen", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage describes a method of separating gases using zeolite molecular sieves, which is a physical process and not related to the chemical properties of the gases. Therefore, the answer is non-organic or physical technology. The rules 3 and 4 are relevant because they distinguish between concepts such as chemical and physical properties, and profession and nationality. \nThe answer: non-organic or physical technology", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage does not provide a specific percentage or number for how much the sieve method of gas production is used, but it does mention that it is \"increasingly obtained\" and is a \"major method\" of producing O2 gas. This implies that it is a significant and growing method of production, but not necessarily a majority. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply, which state that size and comparisons should not be assumed without explicit information, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: The passage does not provide a specific answer to the question.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: water", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant because the question asks what the electrolysis of water produces, which is the opposite of what is stated in the passage (\"Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen\"). Therefore, the answer is hydrogen and oxygen gas. \nThe answer: hydrogen and oxygen gas", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"DC electricity must be used\" for electrolysis, indicating that alternating current (AC) cannot be used. Additionally, the use of \"must\" implies that this is a necessary requirement. \nThe answer: DC", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 17}\nExplanation: Electrolysis of water and chemical catalysts are mentioned as methods of producing oxygen, but the question specifically asks for the source of oxygen production through electrocatalytic means. The phrase \"electrocatalytic O2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids\" directly answers the question. Negation is important because the question asks for the source of oxygen production through electrocatalytic means, not just any method of oxygen production. \nThe answer: oxides and oxoacids", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that concepts such as chemical catalysts are different from concepts such as water or electricity, and that negations are important for the answer. The answer is: chemical catalysts.", "{1, 3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rules state that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A (rule 1), and that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts (rule 3), and that profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4), and that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph (rule 7). The answer is that oxygen is offered for higher than normal O2 exposure for a fee in oxygen bars. \nThe answer: It is offered for higher than normal O2 exposure for a fee.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Oxygen is not a profession or nationality, nor is it an animal or vehicle. The answer is not affected by the size, shape, age, or color of oxygen. \nThe answer: Oxygen has a supposed mild euphoric effect and is used in oxygen bars and by some athletes for a performance boost, although the pharmacological effect is doubtful and a placebo effect is more likely.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: performance", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the pharmacological effect of oxygen as a mild euphoric is doubtful and that a placebo effect is a more likely explanation. Therefore, the answer should reflect that the most likely effect of breathing oxygen is a placebo effect, rather than a pharmacological one.\nThe answer: a placebo effect", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the type of exercise is not relevant to the answer. However, negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for the type of exercise that does receive a boost in performance from oxygen. The answer is aerobic exercise. \nThe answer: aerobic exercise", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the device used to treat carbon monoxide poisoning. Rule 1 tells us that if A is used to treat X, then X can be used to identify A. Rule 3 tells us that we need to focus on the concept of devices. Rule 7 tells us that we need to pay attention to synonyms in the question. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important. \nThe answer: special oxygen chambers", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the answer is \"carbon monoxide\" because increased oxygen concentrations in the patient's lungs help to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is poisonous to anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, meaning that the bacteria cannot survive in the presence of oxygen. This is an example of a negation (rule 3) and the use of antonyms (rule 8).\nThe answer: anaerobic bacteria", "{rule list: 3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.\nThe answer: bubbles of inert gas form in their blood", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: Oxygen therapy is a medical treatment used to benefit patients with heart and lung disorders.\nThe answer: Oxygen therapy", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that \"function\" and \"purpose\" are different concepts. In this case, the purpose of respiration is to uptake O2 from the air, but the function of respiration is to facilitate gas exchange in the body. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, decreasing resistance to blood flow in the lungs would ease the workload on the heart. Therefore, the answer is \"heart.\" \n\nThe answer: heart", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that oxygen supplementation increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the medical treatment used to increase oxygen uptake, which is equivalent to oxygen levels in the blood. \nThe answer: oxygen supplementation", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The article states that \"uptake of O2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration,\" so the answer is respiration.\nThe answer: respiration", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that oxygen therapy is used to treat any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen. Therefore, oxygen therapy promotes the body to take up gaseous oxygen. \nThe answer: gaseous oxygen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen's electronegativity causes it to form bonds with almost all other elements.\nThe answer: electronegativity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides, so the usual form of oxygen bound compounds is oxides.\nThe answer: oxides", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: FeO (w\u00fcstite)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen forms a thin film of oxide on the surface of metals in the presence of air, which passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. This means that oxygen causes metals to form oxides.\nThe answer: Oxides", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3, which states that \"the surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion,\" is relevant. Additionally, rule 8, which states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A,\" is also relevant, as the question asks for what the film of oxide delays. The answer is corrosion. \nThe answer: corrosion", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: cabin depressurization", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that chemical oxygen generators are activated in case of cabin depressurization in commercial airplanes, which then produce a steady stream of oxygen gas through an exothermic reaction. This is a type of chemical production of oxygen.\nThe answer: chemical production", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the type of reaction present in the emergency oxygen generator of an airplane. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. These rules are relevant because they help eliminate irrelevant information and focus on the key concept of the question, which is the type of reaction. The answer is an exothermic reaction. \nThe answer: exothermic", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for the gas produced by the exothermic reaction, which is oxygen. Therefore, the answer is oxygen.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks, cryogenics, and chemical compounds.\nThe answer: storage methods", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers.\" This means that bulk oxygen is shipped as a liquid. Additionally, rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other attributes, so the fact that the oxygen is shipped in bulk does not necessarily mean it is shipped in a large size. \nThe answer: as a liquid", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that oxygen is transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers. This means that oxygen is shipped in liquid state.\nThe answer: liquid", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being related to the physical characteristics of oxygen. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being related to transportation methods. Therefore, the answer is \"the compressed gas.\" \nThe answer: compressed gas", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The rules selected ensure that we understand that the concept of \"organization\" is different from other concepts mentioned in the article, such as \"cryogenics\" and \"oxy-fuel welding and cutting.\" The answer is \"hospitals and other institutions.\" \nThe answer: Hospitals and other institutions.", "3, 7\nExplanation: The question asks for a type of compound that contains oxygen, so rule 3 reminds us that we should focus on the concept of \"compounds\" and not be distracted by other concepts such as size or color. Rule 7 reminds us that we should be aware of synonyms, and in this case, \"compounds\" can be replaced with \"substances.\" \nThe answer: Organic compounds", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen is a necessary part of several organic compounds, including alcohols, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters, acid anhydrides, and amides. These compounds are characterized by the presence of an oxygen atom bonded to a carbon atom. The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so it is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: organic compounds", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Compounds like phenol and acetone are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. The question asks for the function of these compounds in the manufacture of other substances, which implies that they are used as raw materials or intermediates in chemical reactions. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 (to distinguish between concepts of chemical compounds and professions/nationalities) are relevant. Additionally, the question contains the word \"function,\" which implies a cause-and-effect relationship, making rule 8 (to consider antonyms) relevant. Finally, the question contains the word \"serve,\" which implies a positive function, making rule 17 (to consider negations) relevant. \nThe answer: They are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances.", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Oxygen is part of a ring arrangement in epoxides, which are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.\nThe answer: Epoxides", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Compounds that contain oxygen are considered as important organic solvents and feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances in commerce. The use of negation in the question (\"how are they NOT considered\") indicates that we need to apply rules 4 and 8 to determine that the compounds are considered important in commerce. \nThe answer: They are considered important in commerce.", "3, 5\nExplanation: Oxygen is found in almost all biomolecules important to life, including carbohydrates, fats, fatty acids, amino acids, proteins, ATP, ADP, RNA, DNA, and bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite.\nThe answer: Oxygen is found in biomolecules.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. This means that the fact that some biomolecules are \"complex\" does not necessarily mean they contain no oxygen. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. This means that if almost all biomolecules contain oxygen, then only a few common complex biomolecules contain no oxygen. Therefore, the answer is: only a few common complex biomolecules.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the amount of oxygen in a molecule cannot be compared to these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen, then all other organic compounds with biological relevance contain less oxygen by mass. \nThe answer: carbohydrates", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: Oxygen is present in carbohydrates and in phosphate groups in ATP and ADP, as well as in the backbone and purines/pyrimidines of RNA and DNA. Therefore, the answer is carbohydrates and nucleic acids. \nThe answer: carbohydrates and nucleic acids.", "{3, 10, 13}\nExplanation: Oxygen is a part of bones, specifically in calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite. Therefore, we need to identify the body part that contains calcium. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore any spelling errors. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, but there are no names mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: bones", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the potential health risks of deep sea diving, specifically oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts such as health conditions are distinct from concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 tells us that if breathing an air mixture with a high O2 partial pressure can lead to a health condition, then breathing an air mixture with a low O2 partial pressure can prevent that health condition. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and rule 8 states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\" In this case, the question asks what can prolonged breathing of oxygen at 60 kPa lead to, so we need to find the concept associated with this level of oxygen. The passage states that breathing an air mixture with an O2 partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the answer is \"permanent pulmonary fibrosis.\" \n\nThe answer: permanent pulmonary fibrosis.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that exposure to O2 partial pressures greater than 160 kPa may lead to convulsions. This means that pressures greater than 160 kPa can lead to convulsions.\nThe answer: 160 kPa", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the \"most feared effect\" of oxygen toxicity for divers, which implies a negation. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 1 states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, so \"most feared\" can be replaced with \"least desired.\" Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so \"least desired\" can be replaced with \"most desired to avoid.\" \nThe answer: seizures", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"health conditions\" are different from other concepts and the rule that if A causes X and B causes more X, then B causes the antonym of X apply here. Acute oxygen toxicity can cause seizures.\nThe answer: seizures", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Breathing pure oxygen in space applications is not dangerous to health because the low total pressures used in spacesuits and early spacecrafts do not cause damage. The O2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is only slightly higher than normal sea-level O2 partial pressure, which is not harmful to health. \nThe answer: Low total pressures used in space applications do not cause damage.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the O2 partial pressure in the breathing gas of spacesuits is about 30 kPa, which is 1.4 times normal. According to rule 3, size and pressure are different concepts, so we cannot assume that 30 kPa is \"more\" or \"less\" than any other pressure value. However, according to rule 8, if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can say that the O2 partial pressure in spacesuits is higher than normal sea-level O2 partial pressure. \nThe answer: about 30 kPa", "Rule 2, Rule 8\nExplanation: The question asks for a comparison between the oxygen breathed in space suits and normal oxygen levels. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the phrase \"much of normal,\" which implies a comparison. Rule 8 also applies because the question asks for a comparison in terms of a proportion or ratio. \nThe answer: \"only marginally more than normal sea-level O2 partial pressure\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that breathing pure oxygen in space applications causes no damage due to the low total pressures used. Therefore, the answer is that breathing oxygen in space conditions causes no damage.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore cannot be compared. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the resulting O2 partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level O2 partial pressure. Therefore, the answer is that the oxygen level in space suits is only marginally higher than at sea level.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If the partial pressure of oxygen gas is elevated, it can become toxic and lead to health problems such as convulsions. This typically occurs at partial pressures greater than 50 kPa, which is equivalent to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure. However, this is not usually a problem in medical applications where gas supplied through oxygen masks is typically composed of only 30%\u201350% oxygen by volume. \nThe answer: When the partial pressure of oxygen gas is elevated.", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that oxygen toxicity occurs at elevated partial pressures, meaning that lower partial pressures are less toxic. Rule 2 applies because the article states that oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kPa, indicating that this is the most common or extreme level of toxicity. \nThe answer: at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals (kPa)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"units of measurement are different concepts\" applies, as well as the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\" The answer is \"about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Oxygen gas can be toxic at elevated partial pressures, which usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals (kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure. This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators, since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%\u201350% O2 by volume. Therefore, the medical appliance that can be a concern for oxygen toxicity is mechanical ventilators. \nThe answer: mechanical ventilators", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%\u201350% O2 by volume.\" This means that the percentage of oxygen supplied by a medical mask is between 30% and 50%.\nThe answer: between 30% and 50%", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period, which can be answered by identifying the start date of the crisis. Rules 16 and 17 help to identify the active sentence structure and the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: October 1973", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen from US$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally.\" This means that the price of oil in March 1974 was nearly $12.\nThe answer: nearly $12", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the second oil crisis was in 1979 and was termed the \"second oil shock.\" Rule 2 applies because \"second oil crisis\" and \"second oil shock\" are synonyms. Rule 16 applies because \"second\" comes after \"first.\" \nThe answer: 1979", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for another term used for the oil crisis, which means we need to look for a synonym or alternative name for it. Rule 3 tells us that concepts like size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can ignore those. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for a synonym for \"oil crisis\" in the article. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: \"first oil shock\"", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) proclaimed an oil embargo.\" Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC)", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Nationality and foreign policy are different concepts, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: To disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: through multilateral negotiations", "{rule list: 1, 2, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula.\" Rule 1 applies because it compares the negotiation of the troop withdrawal to a previous state where Israel had troops in the Sinai Peninsula. Rule 2 applies because it compares the negotiation of the troop withdrawal to the negotiation of a settlement between Israel and Syria. Rule 16 applies because the date is explicitly mentioned in the sentence.\nThe answer: January 18, 1974", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.\" The rule 2 applies because \"March 1974\" is a specific time and \"enough to convince\" implies that the promise of a negotiated settlement was the reason for lifting the embargo. Rule 8 applies because \"lift\" is the antonym of \"impose\" and the question asks for the end of the embargo. \nThe answer: March 1974", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the date of the US withdrawal, which implies that the US was previously a member of the Accord. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the date of withdrawal, which is the opposite of the date of joining. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"unilaterally,\" which means that the US withdrew without the agreement of other members. \nThe answer: August 15, 1971", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if a currency is left to \"float,\" it means that its value is not fixed or pegged to another currency or commodity. Therefore, the answer is that the currency's value is allowed to fluctuate according to market demand. \n\nThe answer: The value of the currency is allowed to fluctuate according to market demand.", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard, causing the value of the dollar to be left to \"float\" according to market demand. This led to a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. \nThe answer: The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard, causing the value of the dollar to depreciate.", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 stating that they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold. Therefore, the answer is September 1971.\nThe answer: September 1971.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article explains that OPEC started pricing oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold because the US unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord, which led to the depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies, causing a decrease in oil producers' real income. This is a result of the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The negation in the question is also important for the answer, as it asks for the reason why oil started getting priced in terms of gold. \nThe answer: because of the depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies, causing a decrease in oil producers' real income.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that from 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we cannot assume that \"less than two percent\" means a specific number. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the price increase from 1947 to 1967 was not significant. \nThe answer: less than two percent per year", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: OPEC was slow to readjust prices after the depreciation of the dollar, which occurred after 1971. Rule 1 applies because \"slow to readjust\" implies that the adjustment happened later than expected. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for when the adjustment happened, which is the opposite of when it did not happen. \nThe answer: after 1971", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the substantial price increases of 1973-1974 largely returned oil prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold. This implies that oil prices returned to Bretton Woods levels during or after 1974. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"finally\" which implies a comparison between a past and present state. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the time when oil returned to its Bretton Woods levels, which is a comparison of two different states. \nThe answer: during or after 1974", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities.\" This means that the price of oil was usually stable until the oil shock occurred.\nThe answer: the oil shock", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: October 6, 1973", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so they can be ignored. The answer: Iran. \nThe answer: Iran.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Shah of Iran said that Western nations should pay \"ten times more\" for oil. Rule 3 states that size and quantity are different concepts, so we cannot assume that \"ten times more\" means a 10x increase in quantity. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so \"ten times more\" means a 10x increase in price. \nThe answer: 10", "{4, 13, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (4) is relevant because the question asks about a country's ally, not a profession. The rules that names are equally important for the answer (13) and a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession (19) are also relevant because the question asks about a country, not a specific person. The rules that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names (20) and \"his\" refer to male names and \"her\" refer to female names (21) are relevant because the question uses the pronoun \"United States.\" \nThe answer: Iran", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the reason behind the Shah of Iran giving an interview. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a reason why the Shah did give an interview. Rule 23 reminds us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"Weeks later, the Shah of Iran said in an interview\" is in the passive voice, so we need to look for the reason why the interview was conducted. \nThe answer: The reason for the interview is not given in the article.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that OPEC raised the price of oil in response to American aid to Israel, implying that they wanted to harm the US economically. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the reason behind the price increase, which is a different concept than the price itself.\nThe answer: in response to American aid to Israel", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that on October 16, 1973, OPEC raised the posted price of oil by 70% to $5.11 a barrel. Rule 1 applies because it compares the price before and after the increase. Rule 8 applies because it specifies that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\nThe answer: October 16, 1973.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to meet their economic and political objectives", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of emergency aid given to Israel, which is a numerical value. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"much\" which implies a comparison. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a specific value, and the answer will be the opposite of the antonym of \"much.\" \nThe answer: $2.2 billion", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding the context of the article, specifically the events that led to the embargo. OPEC blocked oil deliveries to the United States in response to American aid to Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The relevant rules include understanding the difference between professions and nationalities, the importance of negations, and the use of pronouns. Additionally, the rules regarding the order of events and the use of former and latter are important for understanding the context of the article. \nThe answer: In response to American aid to Israel during the Yom Kippur War.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Saudi Arabia spent \"over 100 billion dollars\" on spreading Wahhabism.\nThe answer: over 100 billion dollars", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the group that benefited from the funds distributed by al-Haramain Foundation, which is mentioned in the context paragraph. Rule 3 states that color, shape, age, and profession are different concepts, so we can ignore them. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"benefited\" and \"funds distributed\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negations in the question or context. \nThe answer: violent Sunni extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.", "{3, 5, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that much of the income from oil sales went to arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions, particularly in the Middle East. This means that the answer is the Middle East.\nThe answer: Middle East", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 8 (antonyms). The question asks for a reason why underdeveloped nations received aid from the oil income, so we look for a reason in the passage. The passage states that underdeveloped nations received aid because their economies were caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities, amid shrinking Western demand. Therefore, the answer is: their economies were struggling due to the fluctuation of oil prices and demand for their own export commodities.", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a specific interpretation of Islam. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"name\" are different from concepts such as \"description.\" Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the interpretation of Islam cannot be referred to as a profession or nationality. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"fundamentalist\" can be considered a synonym for \"extremist.\" Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the specific name of the interpretation should be given. \nThe answer: Wahhabism", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a reason why US production has been held responsible for recessions and lower economic growth. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that \"US production, distribution and price disruptions 'have been held responsible for recessions, periods of excessive inflation, reduced productivity, and lower economic growth.'\" Therefore, the answer is that production, distribution, and price disruptions have been held responsible for recessions and lower economic growth. \n\nThe answer: Production, distribution, and price disruptions.", "{1, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country that the US was concerned about confronting in the Middle East. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more concerned about X than B, then B is less concerned about X than A. Rule 4 applies because it states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is asking about a country, not a profession. Rule 8 applies because it states that if A is more concerned about X than B, then B is more antonym(concerned) about X than A, and A is less antonym(concerned) about X than B. Therefore, the answer is the USSR. \n\nThe answer: USSR", "{rule list: 16, 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific date mentioned in the article. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can assume that the date being referred to is before 1973. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for any negations that might indicate the opposite of what the question is asking. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negations in the question itself. \nThe answer: There is no specific date mentioned in the article, so the answer is \"not mentioned.\"", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (4) tells us that interest groups and government agencies are not a person and therefore cannot be matched against a person. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first (16) tells us that Kissinger comes after interest groups and government agencies in the sentence. \nThe answer: Kissinger", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the embargo had a negative influence on the US economy.\nThe answer: embargo", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the passage states that the price increases from the embargo changed competitive positions in many industries, implying that some industries became less competitive. Therefore, the answer is: automobiles.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts. \nThe answer: macroeconomic problems", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the area where oil companies increased oil supplies. The passage mentions that the embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic. Therefore, the answer is the Arctic. The relevant rules are 3 (to distinguish between different concepts) and 8 (to understand that if the passage mentions an increase in one thing, it implies a decrease in its antonym).", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production. \nThe answer: five to ten years", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the article states that the Netherlands faced a complete embargo, while the other six members of the EEC faced partial cutbacks. Therefore, the answer is: Netherlands.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The UK and France did not allow America to use their airfields.\nThe answer: America", "{4, 17, 20}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying which country supported Israel during the Six-Day War and had traditionally been an ally of Israel. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of governments and focus on the countries themselves. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the successor to the UK government reversed its policy towards Israel. Rule 20 tells us that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can infer that Harold Wilson was male and the one who supported Israel. Therefore, the answer is the UK. \nThe answer: UK", "{rule list: 19, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country that Harold Wilson supported during the Six-Day War. The answer is Israel.\nThe rules used are 19 and 20, which state that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession and that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify who called for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as nationality and geography are different, so we need to pay attention to the political context. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the previous government was more supportive of Israel than the current one. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"withdraw\". \nThe answer: Ted Heath", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that the UK was \"relatively unaffected\" by the embargo.\nThe answer: UK", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the UK faced an oil crisis due to a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers. This is a direct answer to the question.\nThe answer: strikes by coal miners and railroad workers", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the strikes happened \"over the winter of 1973-74\", which means they happened during the winter season that spanned across those two years. Therefore, the strikes happened in 1973-74.\nThe answer: 1973-74", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify a country that banned boating, driving, and flying on Sundays. This information is directly stated in the passage. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore any information related to those concepts. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information related to professions. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"banned\" such as \"prohibited\" or \"restricted\". Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore any information that is not related to the ban on boating, driving, and flying. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to make sure we identify the correct countries that banned these activities. The answer: Germany, Italy, Switzerland, or Norway.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil.\" This directly answers the question.\nThe answer: Sweden", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the price controls limited the price of \"old oil\" while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price. This made old oil less valuable and led to its withdrawal from the market, creating greater scarcity. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" does not apply because none of these concepts are relevant to the question. \nThe answer: Price controls limited the price of \"old oil\" while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price, which led to the withdrawal of old oil from the market and created greater scarcity.", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, newly discovered oil is sold at a higher price because it is more valuable than old oil. Rule 2 also applies, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. The newly discovered oil is most valuable, while the old oil is least valuable. \nThe answer: To encourage investment.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule of \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of confusion between old oil and old in age. The rule of \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies here, as the article states that the price controls limited the price of old oil, which means that newly discovered oil could be sold at a higher price. Therefore, old oil was withdrawn from the market because it could not be sold at a higher price. \nThe answer: Because it could not be sold at a higher price.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify how scarcity was managed in many countries. Rule 3 tells us that we need to differentiate between different concepts, such as scarcity and price controls. Rule 8 tells us that if old oil was limited, then newly discovered oil was sold at a higher price to encourage investment. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. Putting these rules together, we can see that scarcity was managed through rationing, as stated in the passage. \nThe answer: rationing", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Nixon named William E. Simon as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office\" is in the active voice, with \"Nixon\" as the subject and \"William E. Simon\" as the object. Therefore, we use rule 16 to determine that \"William E. Simon\" is the answer. Additionally, we use rule 23 to understand that the subject of an active sentence acts the verb. \nThe answer: William E. Simon", "{3, 10, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article does not mention any election of Nixon or William E. Simon. \nThe answer: N/A", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Federal Energy Office was created to coordinate the response to the embargo, which implies that there was a crisis or problem that needed to be addressed. Rule 1 applies because \"short-term\" is a comparative term, implying that there may have been longer-term organizations or solutions in place. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for the reason for the creation of the organization, which is related to its purpose or function. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negation (\"why not\"), which implies that there was a problem or need that the organization was meant to address. \nThe answer: to coordinate the response to the embargo.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 20%", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the speed limit set to reduce consumption, implying that a higher speed limit would lead to more consumption. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically for the speed limit, which is a concept related to size and measurement. \nThe answer: 55 mph", "{1, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between the national maximum speed limit and other possible speed limits. Rule 7 is relevant because the question asks for the name of the law, which is a synonym for \"act\". Rule 12 is relevant because it states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, and this allows us to ignore the information about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Department of Energy. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for the name of the law which imposed the speed limit, and the word \"imposed\" is a negation. \nThe answer: Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the president who ended the Emergency Energy Conservation Act, which implies that the act was in effect during a previous presidency. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the president who ended the act, which implies that the president came after the presidency during which the act was imposed. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the president who ended the act, which implies a negation of the act. \nThe answer: Bill Clinton", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific event and its time. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). The answer is: November 28, 1995.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by identifying the date mentioned in the passage when the Department of Energy was created, which is 1977. Therefore, the answer is: 1977.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the energy crisis", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"negations are important for the answer.\" The passage states that the criticized energy policies \"ignore market and technology realities.\" Therefore, the answer is that the policies ignore market and technology realities. \nThe answer: market and technology realities", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity that backed policies with doubtful prospects, which is a negation. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 3 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a profession. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so \"politically expedient\" is the antonym of the answer. Therefore, the answer is congresses and presidents. \nThe answer: congresses and presidents", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country that considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields. Rule 1 applies because the question uses the phrase \"forcibly take,\" which is synonymous with \"use force.\" Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the country that was thinking about going to war, which is the antonym of \"considered.\" Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"which country was NOT thinking about going to war\"), which is important for the answer. \nThe answer: The United States", "{rule list: 2, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a country that was worried about a potential US invasion of the Middle East. Rule 2 applies because \"worried\" is a synonym of \"concerned.\" Rule 10 applies because typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Britain", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage does not provide a direct answer to the question, but it does mention that \"the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources.\" This implies that the development of renewable resources would take at least 10 years. Additionally, the use of the word \"alternative\" suggests that the goal was to move away from non-renewable resources. \nThe answer: at least 10 years", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a country that is most dependent on Arab oil. Rule 3 reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 5 reminds us that animals and vehicles are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 6 reminds us that animals and vehicles are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 12 reminds us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 reminds us that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. Rule 19 reminds us that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Rule 20", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil, implying that other countries were less dependent. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the amount of oil, which is a different concept than the country's historical connections to the Middle East. \nThe answer: 71%", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared Japan a \"nonfriendly\" country.\nThe answer: declared Japan a \"nonfriendly\" country", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying when Japan issued a statement \"asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories, advocating Palestinian self-determination, and threatening to reconsider its policy toward Israel if Israel refused to accept these preconditions\". This statement was issued on November 22.\nThe answer: November 22", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: December 25", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country that invaded and showed insecurity in the Middle East. Rule 3 and 4 indicate that concepts such as countries and actions are different. Rule 8 indicates that if A is more insecure than B, then B is more secure than A. Rule 17 indicates that negations are important for the answer. The answer: USSR.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats. \nThe answer: Saudi Arabia and Iran", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the country whose arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. This is a comparison of two quantities, and according to rule 3, size is a different concept from nationality. Therefore, we cannot assume that Israel and the other country are of the same size or population. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can infer that Israel's arms purchases from the US were less than the other country's. \nThe answer: Saudi Arabia", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: January 1979", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979.\" The answer is November 1979. \nThe answer: November 1979.", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The article states that the crisis reduced the demand for large cars, implying that smaller cars were more in demand. Rule 1 applies because it establishes the relationship between large and small cars. Rule 2 applies because it clarifies that the smaller cars were the most fuel-efficient ones. \nThe answer: Large cars", "1, 8, 13, 19\nJapanese cars became more highly sought after as they were more fuel efficient.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article compares the fuel efficiency of Japanese imports with American cars, indicating that they have different types of engines. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, but it also applies to the type of engine. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, if Japanese imports have more fuel-efficient engines than American cars, then American cars have less fuel-efficient engines than Japanese imports.\nThe answer: V8 and six cylinder engines", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the country whose imports became the mass-market leaders. Rule 3 tells us that nationality and size are different concepts, so we can eliminate size as a factor. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate profession as a factor. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Which country's imports became the least popular?\" The answer is the United States. \nThe answer: United States", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size and profession are different concepts, and first comes before last. Nationality is not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: after the 1981 voluntary export restraints", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a larger car, implying that the previously mentioned compacts were small. Rule 3 applies because size is a different concept from other amenities mentioned. \nThe answer: Toyota Corona Mark II", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, power windows, and central locking were added to the larger Japanese cars without increasing the price. These amenities can be considered as \"extras\" added to the production of the compacts.\nThe answer: amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, power windows, and central locking", "{4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that a luxury division is not a nationality. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we can infer that \"their\" refers to multiple names. Therefore, the answer is: Lexus.", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific type of Toyota compact truck is not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the truck is not relevant. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so any animal-related information is not relevant. Names are equally important for the answer, so the specific name of the Toyota compact truck is not necessary. \nThe answer: Toyota Hilux", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Dodge D-50", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Isuzu had joint partnerships with Ford, Chrysler, and GM, respectively. \"Respectively\" indicates that the order of the partnerships matches the order of the companies listed. Therefore, Mazda joined partnership with Ford, Mitsubishi with Chrysler, and Isuzu with GM. \nThe answer: Ford, Chrysler, and GM", "{3, 4, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a policy that ended when American car companies introduced their domestic replacement cars. Rules 3, 4, and 5 help to eliminate irrelevant information about the types of trucks introduced by foreign companies. Rule 16 helps to establish the chronological order of events. \nThe answer: captive import policy", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that an increase in imported cars forced the American car companies to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models. Rule 3 applies because the article distinguishes between large sedans and smaller, more fuel-efficient models. \nThe answer: to compete with imported cars and increase fuel efficiency.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size is a different concept from others, so the size of the Ford Fiesta is not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that the Ford Fiesta is smaller than the other models mentioned in the paragraph, we can infer that it can accommodate less than four passengers. Therefore, the answer is less than four.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the year when American cars' mpg started to improve, which implies that there was a time when they were not as fuel-efficient. Rule 3 states that size and fuel efficiency are different concepts, so the fact that American cars became smaller and more fuel-efficient in the late 1970s is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is 1970, as the average American vehicle moved 13.5 miles per gallon in that year, and the mpg improved to 17.4 by 1985. \n\nThe answer: 1970", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify a luxury model that became popular in the mid-1970s. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of the country of origin of the car. Rule 16 tells us that if two entities are listed, then \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so we can look for a list of cars and identify the luxury model that became popular again in the mid-1970s. The answer: Cadillac DeVille.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept from other attributes is relevant because the question asks specifically about full-sized models. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A is relevant because the passage mentions that sales of large sedans for most makes recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis, but lower price models such as the Chevrolet Bel Air and Ford Galaxie 500 did not recover. \nThe answer: Chevrolet Bel Air and Ford Galaxie 500.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"By 1979, virtually all 'full-size' American cars had shrunk, featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions.\" This means that full sized American cars became smaller by 1979.\nThe answer: 1979", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year.\nThe answer: 1981", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The DOT's revision of categories led to the downsizing of American cars, resulting in smaller engines and dimensions. The question asks for the car that shows this revision, implying that it was a notable example of the downsizing trend. Therefore, we can infer that the car in question was a full-sized American car that was produced before the revision and then downsized after it. The answer is not explicitly stated, but we can use rule 3 to eliminate any cars that were not full-sized, and rule 8 to infer that the car in question was likely more antonym(large) than its predecessor. The most likely answer is GM's full-sized cars, which are mentioned as reflecting the crisis caused by the safety standards and compacts that preceded the DOT revision. \nThe answer: GM's full-sized cars", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for when OPEC's production was surpassed, implying that other countries produced more. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for when OPEC's production was surpassed, implying that OPEC's production was less than that of other countries. \nThe answer: 1981", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the world price...decreased during the 1980s to less than $10 per barrel.\" This means that the price dropped below $10 per barrel at some point during the 1980s. Rule 1 tells us that if A is less than B, then B is more than A, so we can infer that the price dropped below $10 after 1980. Rule 8 tells us that if A is less X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the price dropped below $10 after it had peaked at nearly $40 per barrel in 1979. \nThe answer: during the 1980s", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if Saudi Arabia increased production, then other countries must have decreased production, making Saudi Arabia more X (productive) than those high-cost producers, who became less X (productive) than Saudi Arabia. Rule 8 applies because reducing profits for high-cost producers means reducing their profitability, which is the antonym of \"profitable\". \nThe answer: to recover market share and make high-cost producers less profitable.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the world price, which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $40 per barrel.\" This means that the price of oil reached its highest point during the 1979 energy crisis. According to rule 2, \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X,\" we can infer that the highest price of oil during the crisis was $40 per barrel.\nThe answer: $40 per barrel", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the project that put the first Americans into space. The passage states that Project Mercury was the one-man spacecraft that achieved this feat. This is a straightforward question that requires identifying the correct project name.\nThe answer: Project Mercury", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the program that carried out the Apollo missions and projects. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that NASA is a national agency and not a profession is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the Apollo program was created after Project Mercury and Project Gemini. \nThe answer: The Apollo program", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1968", "{13, 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the President who proposed the idea of putting Americans in space. Rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, which means we need to look for the President's name in the passage. Rule 23 tells us that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we need to look for an active sentence that mentions the President's name. \nThe answer: President John F. Kennedy", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Project Mercury was the first project and there was another project that followed it. The rule 22 states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\", which means that the project that followed Project Mercury is the second project, which is Project Gemini.\nThe answer: two", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972.\"\nThe answer: 1961 to 1972", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the Gemini program came before the Apollo program. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" so we can identify that the Gemini program is the subject of the sentence and \"developed some of the space travel techniques\" is the verb. \nThe answer: The Gemini program.", "{rule list: 4, 5}\nExplanation: The question asks about a collaboration between the U.S. and another entity on an Earth orbit mission in 1975. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the collaboration must be with a specific country or entity, not a profession. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the collaboration cannot be with an animal. The answer is the Soviet Union. \nThe answer: Soviet Union", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the answer cannot be any of these concepts. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which means that we should focus on the last sentence of the passage. \nThe answer: Skylab", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that the Apollo 1 cabin fire occurred before the program succeeded in achieving its goal of manned lunar landing, and it is mentioned as a major setback. Therefore, it is likely to have occurred early in the program. Rule 16 indicates that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so the Apollo 1 cabin fire occurred before the first landing. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so the Apollo 1 cabin fire occurred before the first landing, which was in 1969. \nThe answer: 1967", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The incident mentioned in the article is the Apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test.\nThe answer: prelaunch test", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The Apollo program had plans for nine follow-on landings, but budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of them.\nThe answer: budget cuts", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that there were originally nine follow-on landings planned, but three were cancelled due to budget cuts. This means that there were six remaining missions. The article also states that \"five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings,\" which means that five of the six were successful.\nThe answer: 5", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Apollo 13's landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which disabled the command spacecraft's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions.\nThe answer: Its landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion and the crew returned to Earth safely using the Lunar Module as a \"lifeboat\".", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body.\" Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that \"celestial body\" is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"first\" comes before \"last.\" \nThe answer: Apollo 8", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the question asks for a specific mission that is part of a sequence of moon landings. The rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific position in a sequence. \nThe answer: Apollo 17", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size and weight are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the weight of the rocks is the same as their size. Therefore, we need to use rule 3 to avoid confusion. We also need to use rule 8 to understand that \"842 pounds\" is equivalent to \"382 kg\". \nThe answer: 382 kg", "{3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for areas that were advanced by the Apollo missions, which implies that the missions had an impact on various fields. Rules 3, 4, and 5 establish that different concepts, such as technology and rocketry, are distinct. Rule 7 allows for synonyms to be used in the question. Rules 8 and 10 establish that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and typos and contractions are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 allows for irrelevant passages to be ignored. Rule 17 establishes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: avionics, telecommunications, and computers.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: The Mercury capsule could only support one astronaut.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Mercury capsule could only support one astronaut, while Apollo would carry three astronauts. This implies that Apollo could hold three people, which is more than one. Rule 3 applies because \"people\" and \"capacity\" are different concepts. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a projection, which implies a comparison between two things. \nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that NASA manager Abe Silverstein named the spacecraft. The use of \"who\" in the question indicates that the answer should be a person, and the negation in the question (\"who named\") indicates that the answer should not be the program itself, but rather the person who named it.\nThe answer: Abe Silverstein", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the final goal of the Apollo projects, which is the manned lunar landings. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as missions to a space station versus lunar landings. Rule 4 is relevant because profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question asks for the goal of the project, not the nationality of the astronauts. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the final goal, which implies that there were other goals before it. Therefore, the answer is \"manned lunar landings.\"", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that the Apollo program was conceived during the Eisenhower administration in early 1960. This means that it was conceived in the first few months of 1960, during Eisenhower's presidency.\nThe answer: early 1960", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Apollo program was announced in July 1960 by NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden.\nThe answer: 1960", "{16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Maxime Faget, who is mentioned last in the passage, is the answer to the question. Rule 13 states that \"names are equally important for the answer\", which means that we can directly extract the answer from the passage.\nThe answer: Maxime Faget", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The date October 25th is important for the answer. The question asks for a specific number, which is a numerical value. Therefore, rule 16 applies. The sentence \"On October 25, three study contracts were awarded\" is in the passive voice, where the subject (who awarded the contracts) is not explicitly stated. Therefore, rule 23 applies, which states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: three", "{16, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person who held the position of deputy administrator of NASA in 1960. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the person's first name is more important than their last name. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer. Therefore, we can simply look for the name of the deputy administrator in the article and output it as the answer.\nThe answer: Hugh L. Dryden", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we can identify that the person elected was the first mentioned in the sentence, which is John F. Kennedy. Rule 20 establishes that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can use this rule to confirm that Kennedy is a male name.\nThe answer: John F. Kennedy", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts, negations are important for the answer}\nExplanation: Kennedy promised American superiority over the Soviet Union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense.\nThe answer: Soviet Union", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Kennedy was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing, which can be interpreted as him considering the cost to be too high. This fits with rule 3, which states that cost is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"too high\" can be seen as the antonym of \"reasonable\" or \"affordable,\" which would be the more positive way of describing the cost. \nThe answer: the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency...\".\nThe answer: James E. Webb.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"missile gap\"", "{rule list: 1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space.\" Rule 1 applies because \"first\" implies a comparison between Gagarin and other people who have flown in space. Rule 3 applies because \"first\" does not relate to size, shape, age, or color. Rule 4 applies because Gagarin's profession (cosmonaut) and nationality (Soviet) are mentioned. \nThe answer: Yuri Gagarin", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the country that the first person in space came from. Rule 3 states that color, size, shape, and age are different concepts from nationality, so any information about these concepts can be ignored. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the name of the person who went to space (Yuri Gagarin) is relevant. \nThe answer: Soviet Union (or Russia)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: one day after", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: President Kennedy refused to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.\nThe answer: nothing/ no action", "{rule list: 10, 11, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the specific date when Kennedy sent a memo to his vice president. Rules 10 and 11 state that typos and contractions are irrelevant to the answer, while rule 16 establishes that the order of time should be respected. The answer is: April 20.", "{16, 19, 20}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that the vice president came after Kennedy in the hierarchy. We use rules 19 and 20 to determine that the gender of the vice president is irrelevant to their profession and that \"he\" refers to male names. \nThe answer: Lyndon B. Johnson", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Johnson responded \"approximately one week later.\"\nThe answer: approximately one week", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of \"maximum effort\" and \"achieving results necessary.\" Rule 2 applies because the question asks for the general consensus, which implies a comparison to other possibilities. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the negation of a statement. \nThe answer: The United States was not making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary to reach a position of leadership.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Robert R. Gilruth led the Space Task Group. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence \"managing the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth's Space Task Group\" is in the passive voice, and therefore Robert R. Gilruth is the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: Robert R. Gilruth", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: NASA's Langley Research Center", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that a site was chosen in Houston, Texas, on land donated by Rice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961. Therefore, the answer is Houston, Texas. \nThe answer: Houston, Texas.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Rice University", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article mentions that NASA controlled missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida. This is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject (NASA) is being acted upon (controlling missions) by the verb (from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities). Therefore, we can use rules 16 and 23 to determine that the launching facilities were in Florida.\nThe answer: Florida", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island. \nThe answer: Merritt Island", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"The design, development and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H. Debus\" is in the passive voice, meaning that Kurt H. Debus is the one who conducted the construction of the new center.\nThe answer: Kurt H. Debus", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Kurt H. Debus was appointed the LOC's first Director.\nThe answer: Director", "{16, 23, 24, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes the construction of the Launch Operations Center (LOC) at Merritt Island, which was led by Kurt H. Debus. After President Kennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy. Therefore, the answer is Kennedy. \nThe answer: Kennedy", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"at least three pads were planned\" but only two were completed. This means that the original plan was for three launch pads.\nThe answer: at least three", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250,000 feet (76 km), which is nearly a vacuum.\" This indicates that the Apollo spacecraft was tested in the vacuum chambers to simulate atmospheric pressure.\nThe answer: Apollo spacecraft", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 250,000 feet (76 km)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from location, profession, and nationality. First comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: 130 million cubic foot (3.7 million cubic meter)", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Webb recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job.\nThe answer: Dr. George E. Mueller", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Mueller was announced as Deputy Associate Administrator on July 23, 1963, and would replace D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so the announcement date of July 23 comes before the effective date of September 1. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" but the sentence in question is in the active voice, so this rule is not relevant. \nThe answer: July 23, 1963", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: D. Brainerd Holmes", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that under the reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth), Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun), and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.

Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb.\nThe answer: Golovin worked at NASA.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: July 11, 1962", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the person who was showing disagreement, which implies that there was pressure being exerted. Rule 7 applies because \"keeping pressure\" and \"showing disagreements\" are synonyms for \"exerting pressure\" and \"disagreeing,\" respectively. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"who was keeping pressure and showing disagreements\"), which means that the answer is the person who was not doing those things. \nThe answer: Wiesner", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"No, that's no good\"", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article explains that NASA issued a request for proposal to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors and later announced the selection of Grumman as the LEM contractor. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that LEM is a different concept from other concepts mentioned in the article, and rule 7 to understand that LEM may be referred to by synonyms. \nThe answer: Lunar Excursion Module", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Grumman", "{1, 5, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the advantage of the LOR method is that the lander spacecraft could be used as a \"lifeboat\" in the event of a failure of the command ship. Rule 5 applies because spacecraft and vehicles are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"in the event of a failure\") which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: the lander spacecraft could be used as a \"lifeboat\" in the event of a failure of the command ship.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Apollo 13", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: The Lunar Module provided propulsion, electrical power, and life support to get the crew home safely after an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power. The negation in the question (\"What did the Lunar Module provide to help get the Apollo 13 home safely?\") is important for the answer. \nThe answer: propulsion, electrical power, and life support", "{rule list: 15, 18}\nExplanation: The Lunar Module (LM) was dropped as a lifeboat option because no single reasonable Command/Service Module (CSM) failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the Service Propulsion System (SPS). The answer is not directly stated in the article, but it can be inferred that the LM was dropped as a lifeboat option before the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, where the LM was used as a lifeboat. Therefore, the LM was likely dropped as a lifeboat option before 1970. \nThe answer: before 1970", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that Maxime Faget's preliminary Apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module.\nThe answer: Cone-shaped", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes the design of the Command/Service Module (CSM) for the Apollo missions. The acronym CSM stands for Command/Service Module.\nThe answer: Command/Service Module", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article describes the design of the Apollo spacecraft, including the Lunar Excursion Module (LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the Command/Service Module (CSM). Rule 3 states that size and number are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the LM could only carry two people based on its size. However, rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the LM would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.\nThe answer: two", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Command Module was designed to carry three astronauts.\nThe answer: three", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage describes that the Command Module was designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing. The module was equipped with parachutes to slow its descent to splashdown. Therefore, the CM was intended to land in an Earth ocean.\nThe answer: Earth ocean", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the material that covers the outside of the CM is not related to any of these concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the outside of the CM is covered in a material that protects it from heat, then the antonym of \"protects\" is \"damages\" or \"destroys\". Therefore, the answer is \"ablative heat shield\". \nThe answer: ablative heat shield", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that parachutes were carried to slow the Command Module's descent to splashdown, indicating that they were incorporated to help slow its descent.\nThe answer: Parachutes", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size and weight are different concepts, so we need to use rule 16 to determine that weight is the relevant concept for this question.\nThe answer: 5,560 kg", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage describes a cylindrical Service Module that supported the Command Module and had a service propulsion engine and a RCS with propellants. This module helped support the Command Module with propulsion and propellants. \nThe answer: Service Module", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule that \"shape\" is a different concept from \"size\" means that the size of the antenna is not relevant to the answer. The rule that \"typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer\" means that the typo in \"comunication\" does not affect the answer.\nThe answer: high-gain S-band antenna", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Service Module was discarded just before re-entry.\nThe answer: It was discarded just before re-entry.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the Service Module, including its size and weight. The answer can be found in the sentence \"The initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51,300 pounds (23,300 kg) fully fueled.\" \nThe answer: 51,300 pounds", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The article mentions that on extended lunar missions, an orbital scientific instrument package was carried. This indicates that a specific type of payload, namely a scientific instrument package, was carried on these missions. This answer does not involve size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, vehicles, or any other irrelevant concepts.\nThe answer: an orbital scientific instrument package", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: North American Aviation", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the question asks for the thrust required for translunar flight, which is less than the thrust required to lift the CSM off the Moon. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for an estimation, which implies that the answer may not be exact. \nThe answer: approximately half the thrust of the service propulsion engine. (Note: the article does not provide an exact number, but states that the engine was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight.)", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a program definition study that concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I and Block II would incorporate docking equipment and take advantage of lessons learned in Block I development. Therefore, we need to determine the year of this program definition study. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from size and shape, so we can ignore the mention of \"early testing\" and \"actual lunar spacecraft\" in the passage. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last,\" so Block I comes before Block II. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to note that the passage does not say \"no program definition study was done.\" The answer: 1964.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that North American Aviation is a company and not a person is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the launch vehicle is the Saturn V. \nThe answer: Saturn V", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that the Lunar Module was designed to land \"two astronauts\" on the Moon. This indicates that the number of astronauts intended to be taken from orbit to the surface was two.\nThe answer: two", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the LM was \"not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth.\" This means that the LM was not intended to return to Earth.\nThe answer: No, the LM was not intended to return to Earth.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the initial LM model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds (15,100 kg).\nThe answer: 15,100 kg", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because the question asks about the duration of a surface stay, which is related to time, not size or weight. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because the extended LM allowed for longer surface stays than the initial LM. \nThe answer: over 3 days", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket engineers.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Army", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the development of the Saturn rocket family for the Apollo program, which replaced the previously planned Nova rockets. The question asks for the timing of the decision to make this change. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from size, shape, etc., so the fact that the Saturn rockets were developed \"before the Apollo program began\" is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last,\" so we can assume that the decision to use the Saturn V was made after the plans for the Nova rockets were already in progress. Therefore, the answer is: after the plans for the Nova rockets had begun, but before the Apollo program began.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those details from the passage. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the initial first stages carried dummy upper stages. \nThe answer: dummy upper stages filled with water.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1964 and 1965", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Pegasus satellites", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The Saturn IB was an upgraded version of the Saturn I.\"\nThe answer: Saturn IB", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 200,000 lbf (890 kN)", "{3, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The article describes the Saturn V rocket and its various stages. The question specifically asks about the S-IVB-200 stage, which is mentioned in the passage as being used as the third stage of the Saturn V. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that the S-IVB-200 is a different concept from the other stages mentioned in the article. Rule 5 also applies, as animals and vehicles are different concepts and the Saturn V is a vehicle. Finally, rule 16 applies as the question asks about the order of the stages in the Saturn V rocket. \nThe answer: third stage", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding that the Saturn IB's thrust was increased and that it could send over 40,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts like thrust and weight. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks about weight, but the passage provides information about thrust, which is the opposite concept. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is not a specific weight, but rather the maximum weight that could be sent into space with the given amount of thrust. \nThe answer: over 40,000 pounds (18,100 kg)", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the Saturn V was designed to send a fully fueled CSM and LM to the Moon, indicating that the CSM and LM were less capable of reaching the Moon without the Saturn V. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the specific objects that were intended to be sent to the Moon, which are different concepts from the Saturn V rocket. \nThe answer: CSM and LM", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from other concepts like age, shape, and color.\nThe answer: 33 feet", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Saturn V had a \"three-stage\" design, and later mentions the \"second and third stages,\" indicating that there were indeed three stages in total. Additionally, the order in which the stages are mentioned (S-IC first, then second and third stages) follows the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\"\nThe answer: 3", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The second stage of the Saturn V burned liquid hydrogen. \nThe answer: The question does not provide enough information to answer.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts and first coming before last apply to the mention of Project Mercury and Gemini veterans being chosen as Apollo astronauts. The answer is: Project Mercury and Gemini veterans.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, animals and vehicles are different concepts, and first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that the Apollo astronauts were chosen from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans, and that all missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans. Therefore, all Apollo missions were manned by previous Mercury and Gemini veterans.\nThe answer: All Apollo missions were manned by previous Mercury and Gemini veterans.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Dr. Harrison Schmitt was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17.\nThe answer: Dr. Harrison Schmitt", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Schmitt was an astronaut who participated in the Apollo missions. He landed on the Moon on the last mission, which was Apollo 17. Rule 16 helps to identify that the last mission is the one that Schmitt landed on, while Rule 23 helps to understand that the passive voice is used in the sentence \"landed on the Moon\" to indicate that Schmitt was acted upon by the verb \"landed\". \nThe answer: Apollo 17", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Apollo 17 was the last mission, and that Dr. Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the first NASA scientist astronaut to land on the Moon. \nThe answer: Apollo 17 was the last mission and the first to include a NASA scientist astronaut.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: We need to find the number of astronauts who were rewarded for their efforts. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about these factors. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about nationality. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"How many astronauts were not rewarded for their efforts?\" From the article, we know that all 32 astronauts were awarded NASA's highest honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, except for the crew of Apollo 7 who were initially awarded a lesser medal but later received the Distinguished Service Medal. Therefore, the answer is 0.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: We can eliminate rules 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 because they are not relevant to the question. Rule 24 is not applicable because the sentence is not in passive voice. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and we need to focus on the concept of \"medal\" in the sentence. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, and we need to focus on the concept of \"medal\" in the sentence. Rule 8 is relevant because it tells us that if NASA gave the Distinguished Service Medal to the astronauts who visited space and the moon, then they gave the lesser medal to those who did not. Therefore, the answer is: Distinguished Service Medal.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the medals were awarded posthumously to Grissom, White, and Chaffee in 1969.\nThe answer: 1969", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The crew of Apollo 7 were awarded the lesser NASA Exceptional Service Medal because of discipline problems with the Flight Director's orders during their flight.\nThe answer: Discipline problems with the Flight Director's orders during their flight.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the DSMs were awarded to the crews of all missions from Apollo 8 onward.\nThe answer: Apollo 8", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1966", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that altitude is a different concept from distance. We use rule 8 to infer that \"reached an altitude of\" means \"reached a higher altitude than\". \nThe answer: 265.7 nautical miles", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is a distance measurement, which is a concept that is different from size, shape, age, and color (Rule 3). The question asks for a specific value of distance in kilometers, which is a unit of measurement that is the antonym of nautical miles (Rule 8). \nThe answer: 25,700 km", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the two suborbital flights validated the Command Module heat shield, which implies that the flights tested the heat shield's ability to withstand the high temperatures of re-entry. The use of the word \"validated\" suggests that the testing was successful. \nThe answer: Command Module heat shield", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"After an unmanned LM test flight AS-206, a crew would fly the first Block II CSM and LM in a dual mission known as AS-207/208, or AS-278.\" This means that the AS-206 test flight was unmanned, so there were no people on it.\nThe answer: none/zero/nobody", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a new Apollo spacesuit designed for lunar extravehicular activity (EVA) that includes a water-cooled undergarment. It also describes a change in the visor helmet to a clear \"fishbowl\" type for greater visibility. \nThe answer: a new Apollo spacesuit with a clear \"fishbowl\" type visor helmet and a water-cooled undergarment.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: Rules 3 and 8 apply because size and shape are different concepts, and the question asks about the type of helmet on the spacesuits. The answer is that the traditional visor helmet was originally on the spacesuits. \nThe answer: traditional visor helmet", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. However, the rule that \"typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer\" is relevant, as the typo in \"if any\" does not affect the answer. \nThe answer: water-cooled", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lunar Module Pilot", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Deke Slayton, as Director of Flight Crew Operations, selected the first Apollo crew.\nThe answer: Deke Slayton", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Deke Slayton worked with the Gemini and Apollo programs before becoming Director of Flight Crew Operations.\nThe answer: Gemini and Apollo programs", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Slayton selected the first Apollo crew in January 1966.\nThe answer: 1966", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Donn F. Eisele", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Eisele was originally selected as a pilot for the first Apollo crew, but had to undergo surgery after dislocating his shoulder twice. Slayton replaced him with Chaffee, and Eisele was eventually announced as part of the prime crew for AS-205.\nThe answer: AS-205", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The AS-205 mission was canceled.\nThe answer: The AS-205 mission was canceled.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: August 1967", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: AS-258 was a combination of the canceled AS-205 mission and the AS-208 mission, and was also known as AS-205/208.\nThe answer: the canceled AS-205 mission and the AS-208 mission", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were \"reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew,\" indicating that they were moved to a different mission. This is an example of a passive sentence, where the subject (the astronauts) is acted upon (reassigned) by the verb. Additionally, the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps to identify that Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were the last group of astronauts mentioned in the passage, and therefore the ones who were relocated. \nThe answer: Apollo 1 backup crew", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Samuel Phillips", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"tiger team\"", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Lunar Module was not going to be ready for manned flight in 1967, so the answer must be a year after 1967.\nThe answer: There was no scheduled first manned flight with the Lunar Module in 1967.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence states that the crew trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center. This means that the tests were conducted at the Kennedy Space Center's altitude chamber.\nThe answer: altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Grissom, White, and Chaffee named their flight Apollo 1. Therefore, they were the main crew of Apollo 1 and named themselves.\nThe answer: Grissom, White, and Chaffee", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a launch countdown with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Grissom, White, and Chaffee trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American, in addition to the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center.\nThe answer: North American", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a strange odor in their spacesuits", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: on the morning of January 27, 1967", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The delay for the spacesuit odor caused a delay in sealing the hatch, which led to communication problems. \nThe answer: communications problems frustrated the astronauts", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rules selected are those that help to identify what happened to the crew during the plugs-out test. Rule 1 helps to understand that the crew did not survive the test. Rule 3 and 4 help to differentiate between the different concepts mentioned in the passage, such as the fire and the cabin. Rule 5 helps to differentiate between animals and vehicles, which are not relevant in this context. Rule 8 helps to understand that the crew was not able to survive the fire. Rule 17 helps to identify that the crew was asphyxiated. \nThe answer: The crew was asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the fire spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere.\nThe answer: high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: both houses of Congress", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"deficiencies existed in Command Module design, workmanship and quality control.\" This implies that the design of the Command Module was found to be at fault for the fire. \nThe answer: Command Module design", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that George Low replaced Joseph Francis Shea as ASPO Manager. We also use rule 23 to understand that the sentence is in the active voice, meaning that George Low was the one who replaced Shea.\nThe answer: George Low", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a specific time frame, which can be found in the context sentence \"NASA immediately convened an accident review board.\" This sentence indicates that the review board was created right after the incident. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb), which help to identify the subject (NASA) and the timing (immediately) of the action (convened an accident review board). \nThe answer: immediately", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between pure oxygen and the new mixture. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as the type of atmosphere inside the cabin. \nThe answer: nitrogen/oxygen mixture", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that color, size, shape, and age are different concepts, while rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. The passage mentions that flammable cabin and space suit materials were removed to prevent fire hazards in the future. Therefore, the answer is: flammable cabin and space suit materials.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them cannot be used to answer the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the door on the Block II design was a quick-release, outward opening door, since it replaced the less safe plug-type hatch cover on the Block I spacecraft. \nThe answer: quick-release, outward opening door", "{rule list: 3, 15}\nExplanation: The Block I program was discontinued for manned flights and only used for unmanned Saturn V flights.\nThe answer: discontinued for manned flights", "{3, 19}\nExplanation: The passage states that crew members would exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant Block II space suits. The rules of size, shape, age, and color being different concepts and a person's gender being irrelevant to their profession are relevant here. \nThe answer: modified, fire-resistant Block II space suits", "{rule list: 1, 2, 16}\nExplanation: The sequence of missions approved by Mueller had to be accomplished in a specific order, with each step successfully completed before moving on to the next. The missions were labeled with letters instead of numbers, with A being unmanned Saturn V validation and G being the first manned landing. Therefore, the answer is: manned lunar landing missions.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed.\nThe answer: Each mission had to be successfully accomplished before the next one could be performed.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that NASA used letters instead of numbers to label the sequence of mission types required to achieve the manned lunar landing, since it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary. This applies rules 2 and 8, which state that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: letters", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V and B is a later unmanned flight of the Saturn V, then A is earlier than B, and rule 16, which states that the first comes before the last and the last comes after the first.

Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the question is asking for the first unmanned test flight, so we know that any other Apollo mission that tested the LM would be less relevant. Rule 16 applies because it clarifies that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Apollo 5 (AS-204)", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the sentence \"Apollo 5 (AS-204) was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968,\" the launch pad number \"37\" comes after the mention of the mission name \"Apollo 5.\" Therefore, the answer is: pad 37.", "{rule list: 4, 22}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"Grumman wanted a second unmanned test\" for the LM. Grumman is the name of the company that built the LM. According to rule 4, profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Grumman is a company and not a person is irrelevant. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed and \"latter\" to the last, but there are only two entities mentioned in the sentence and neither is referred to as \"former\" or \"latter\". \nThe answer: Grumman", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the overall testing of the LM, which is a different concept than the specific programming error mentioned in the article. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a binary answer (failure or success), and the article provides information that allows us to determine that the testing was a success. \nThe answer: success", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"fire-in-the-hole\" test", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Apollo 8 was planned to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, launched on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs. This means that the original plan was to use two Saturn IBs, but it was changed to a single Saturn V. Therefore, the answer is Saturn IB. \nThe answer: Saturn IB.", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The rules of 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph), 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer), 13 (names are equally important for the answer), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) are relevant. The answer: Zond 5.", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Gemini veterans Frank Borman and James Lovell, and rookie William Anders captured the world's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve.\" This means that the images were transmitted on December 24th.\nThe answer: December 24th", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the original plan was for Apollo 8 to orbit the Earth, but instead it was sent to orbit the Moon. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the purpose of Apollo 8's mission, which is a different concept than the location of its orbit. Rule 16 applies because the article mentions that the decision to send Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon was made in order to keep the program on track. \nThe answer: to orbit the Moon", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks about the Soviet Union's plans after the success of Zond 5. The passage states that \"it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts.\" This indicates that the Soviets intended to send human cosmonauts around the Moon in their spacecraft. The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 7 (synonyms), and 13 (names equally important). \nThe answer: human cosmonauts", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the project that the Apollo 11 crew consisted entirely of. The sentence \"The G mission was achieved on Apollo 11\" indicates that the mission was part of the Gemini project. Therefore, the answer is Gemini. \nThe answer: Gemini", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage explicitly states that the Apollo 11 mission occurred in July 1969.\nThe answer: July 1969", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the astronauts were \"continuously sending black-and-white television back to Earth.\" This indicates that they were sending live signals of their activities on the moon back to Earth. \nThe answer: black-and-white television signals", "{rule list: 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rule list includes rules 16, 20, and 21 because they deal with identifying and referring to people by their names and gender. \nThe rationale is that the question asks for the names of the astronauts, and the answer includes their names as well as their gender. \nThe answer: Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article mentions that the astronauts returned safely on July 24, which means that this is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: July 24", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific details about the lunar probe and the EVAs are not relevant to the answer. However, the order of the astronauts' names is important, as the question specifically asks for \"Charles 'Pete' Conrad and rookie Alan L. Bean.\" Therefore, the answer is Apollo 12.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any information about those characteristics. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Surveyor 3 was the last mentioned lunar probe and therefore the one near the Apollo 12 crew's landing site. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can identify that Surveyor 3 is the object of the passive verb \"had landed\" and therefore the lunar probe near the Apollo 12 crew's landing site. \nThe answer: Surveyor 3", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks about what the crew of Apollo 12 did with parts of the Surveyor they landed near after photographing them. The passage states that they \"removed some parts which they returned to Earth.\" Therefore, the answer is: They returned the parts to Earth.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: accidentally pointing it into the Sun", "{3, 5, 8}\nExplanation: The latter Apollo missions would carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) to increase exploration.\nThe answer: Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.\nThe answer: Block II spacesuit", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: NASA had a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites.\nThe answer: eight", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the final missions would allow the astronauts to stay on the Moon for over three days, indicating that they would be able to stay for at least three days.\nThe answer: over three days", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that for the last five missions, there were plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM, as well as the payload capacity of the Saturn V. This means that the LM and CSM would have to be made more massive. Additionally, the use of the word \"last\" implies that these changes were not made for the earlier missions. Therefore, rules 2 and 8 apply. \nThe answer: mass and payload capacity", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the reason why the Apollo 13 crew had to use the LM as a \"life boat\". The answer is that a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the Service Module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"life boat\" to return to Earth. The explosion was caused by a combination of damage to the tank in the factory and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications. The use of the word \"force\" in the question indicates a negation, which is important for the answer. The size and shape of the LM are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: A liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the Service Module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"life boat\" to return to Earth.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16}\nExplanation: The rules eliminate any irrelevant information and ensure that we understand that the question is asking for the types of crew that could be included after the successful landings of Apollo 11 and 12. The answer is \"two rookies\". \nThe answer: two rookies", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: It was grounded.", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The Apollo program was grounded during 1970 and the oxygen tank was redesigned.\nThe answer: oxygen tank", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The mission referred to in the article is Apollo 13, which launched in April 1970.\nThe answer: April 1970.", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the cancellation of Apollo 20 was a result of the decision to use an existing Saturn V to launch the pre-built Skylab. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about the cancellation of one mission, not the overall impact on the Apollo program. Rule 16 applies because the cancellation of Apollo 20 was the first to be cancelled due to the decision to pre-build Skylab on the ground. \nThe answer: Apollo 20", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the budget \"shrank\" does not necessarily mean it decreased. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about a change in the budget, and the answer states that it \"began to shrink.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a negation, and the answer states that the budget \"also had to make funds available\" for the Space Shuttle. \nThe answer: NASA's yearly budget began to shrink.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. However, rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which is relevant to understanding that missions 18 and 19 were the last ones planned. The answer is that they became museum exhibits at various locations.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1971", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth. This is a comparison of age, which follows rule 1. The comparison is not about size, shape, age, or color, so rule 3 applies. \nThe answer: They are much older.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from other concepts means that the age of the rocks is not related to their composition or location. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B means that if the rocks on the Moon are older than rocks on Earth, then rocks on Earth are younger than rocks on the Moon. \nThe answer: The oldest rock samples found on the Moon range in age from about 3.2 billion years to about 4.6 billion years.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that a geochemical component called KREEP was discovered in rocks from the Moon, which has no known counterpart on Earth.\nThe answer: KREEP", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions the \"Genesis Rock\" as the important rock found during the Apollo 15 mission, and also mentions the discovery of KREEP in this context. \nThe answer: Genesis Rock", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the absence of an atmosphere on the moon is being compared to the thick atmosphere on Earth. Rule 3 applies because the answer is referring to a physical characteristic of the moon rocks. \nThe answer: micrometeoroid impact craters", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the article states that \"almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects,\" implying that a great majority of the rocks have been impacted. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" applies because the article mentions various physical characteristics of the rocks, but these are not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Evidence of impact process effects, including micrometeoroid impact craters, high pressure shock waves, and impact melt.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"materials melted near an impact crater\" is impact melt, and the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, apply. The answer is: materials melted near an impact crater.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the estimated procured spending on the Apollo project in 2005 dollars, which means we need to take inflation into account. Rule 1 applies because we need to understand that the estimate is in 2005 dollars, which means it is adjusted for inflation. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the estimated spending, which is the same as the procured spending. \nThe answer: roughly $170 billion", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of Saturn V rockets produced is not related to their size or shape. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the number of Saturn V rockets produced is a specific piece of information that can be found in the article. \nThe answer: 15", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article provides two different estimates for the cost of the Apollo program, one in 2005 dollars and one adjusted for inflation to 2010 dollars. The question specifically asks for the cost from 1959 to 1973, which is the length of the program. Therefore, we need to use the second estimate of $20.4 billion in 1973 dollars, which is equivalent to $109 billion in 2010 dollars according to the article. \nThe answer: $20.4 billion (in 1973 dollars) or $109 billion (in 2010 dollars)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Apollo Applications Program", "{rule list: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a planet that was the target of a fly-by mission by an empty S-IVB. The relevant information is that the most ambitious plan of the Apollo Applications Program called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly-by mission. Therefore, the answer is Venus.\nThe answer: Venus", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Skylab was launched in 1973. According to rule 2, \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X.\" Therefore, \"1973\" is the most concise and minimal answer.\nThe answer: 1973", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 distinguishes between concepts such as size and shape, which are not interchangeable. Rule 16 establishes that the order of events is important. The question asks whether the Skylab was assembled on Earth's surface or in space, and the passage states that it was \"constructed complete on the ground rather than in space,\" indicating that it was assembled on Earth's surface. \nThe answer: on Earth's surface", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when Skylab's last crew was on the station, which is a specific point in time. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" meaning that the last crew was the most recent crew to be on the station. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is the case in the sentence \"Skylab's last crew departed the station.\" Therefore, the answer is February 8, 1974.\nThe answer: February 8, 1974.", "{3, 5, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Skylab was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount, which would have been used on the Apollo Telescope Missions. This means that the equipment onboard the Skylab was intended for a different mission. \nThe answer: solar telescope", "{3, 13, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying which NASA orbiter photographed evidence of each site on the moon where a manned Apollo mission landing occurred. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which helps us eliminate the information about the U.S. flags from consideration. Rule 13 is relevant because it reminds us that names are equally important for the answer, which helps us identify that the NASA orbiter in question is the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Rule 16 is relevant because it reminds us that first comes before last and last comes after first, which helps us identify that the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is the last entity mentioned in the passage. Rule 23 is relevant because it reminds us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which helps us identify that the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A is relevant because the question asks for the exception to the statement that all of the U.S. flags left on the Moon during the Apollo missions are still standing. The answer is the flag left during the Apollo 11 mission. \nThe answer: Apollo 11 mission", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks whether the U.S. flags on the moon still have their original coloring or were they faded due to the Sun. Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession, so it is important to pay attention to it. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the flags were not faded, they would still have their original colors. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer is that the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown. \nThe answer: unknown", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The crew of Apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the Earth and the Moon back to Earth.\nThe answer: Apollo 8", "{rule list: 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the specific book of the Bible that the crew of Apollo 8 read from during their transmission. Rule 3 states that concepts such as books of the Bible are different from concepts such as the Earth and the Moon. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which is relevant because the question uses the phrase \"Bible book\" instead of \"Book of Genesis.\" Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, which is relevant because the question specifically asks for the name of the book. \nThe answer: Book of Genesis", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an estimated one-quarter of the population of the world", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks about the type of ending that the images from space provided after a troubled year in 1968. Rules 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 22 are not relevant to this question. Rule 22 is not relevant because there are no entities listed. The answer can be found in the passage, which states that the images from space provided an inspiring end to 1968. Rule 1 is not relevant because there is no comparison being made. Rule 3 is not relevant because size, shape, age, and color are not being compared. Rule 4 is not relevant because profession and nationality are not being compared. Rule 5 is not relevant because animals and vehicles are not being compared. Rule 6 is not relevant because animals and vehicles are not being compared.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that a \"special Apollo TV camera\" was used to record the Moon landing.\nThe answer: A special Apollo TV camera.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the footage was recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV. Negation is important for the answer.\nThe answer: incompatible", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a magnetic tape shortage", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: newer satellite data", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera, worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.\nThe answer: Stan Lebar.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who compiled the original surviving Apollo 11 landing data. The article states that the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger. Rule 16 applies as it specifies that first comes before last and last comes after first. Rule 23 applies as it specifies that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence in the article is in the passive voice, but the answer requires the active voice. Therefore, we need to identify the subject of the sentence, which is \"Nafzger,\" and rephrase the sentence in the active voice. \nThe answer: Nafzger compiled the original surviving Apollo 11 landing data.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The third rule states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore any changes made to the tapes' visual quality do not affect their historical legitimacy. The eighth rule states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the video was processed to remove noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy, so it can be inferred that some aspects of the tapes would have lost historical legitimacy if they had not been processed. \nThe answer: The tapes were able to be restored and processed without destroying historical legitimacy.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center\" were used to help restore the original tapes.\nThe answer: kinescope recordings", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the company tasked with restoring the original tapes. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name of the company. The answer is: Lowry Digital. \nThe answer: Lowry Digital.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"color\" is a different concept from other characteristics means that the answer will not involve adding color to the restored tapes. The rule that negations are important for the answer means that the answer is that the restored video remained in black and white. \nThe answer: remained black and white", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article explicitly states that there are three sources of European Union law: primary law, secondary law, and supplementary law. The order in which they are listed follows the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\"\nThe answer: primary law, secondary law, and supplementary law.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: European Union law is a body of treaties and legislation that have direct or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states. The main sources of primary law are the Treaties establishing the European Union, while secondary sources include regulations and directives based on the Treaties. The legislature of the European Union is composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. \nThe answer: a body of treaties and legislation with direct or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the main sources of primary law in European Union law are the Treaties establishing the European Union. This falls under rule 3, which states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts.\nThe answer: Treaties establishing the European Union.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Primary law is established by the Treaties establishing the European Union. Secondary sources of primary law include regulations and directives which are based on the Treaties. \nThe answer: regulations and directives", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps us identify the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature. The answer is: the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that European Union law affects the laws of member states. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of size, shape, age, color, profession, and nationality, which are not relevant to the definition of European Union law. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of profession and nationality, which are not relevant to the definition of European Union law.\nThe answer: a body of treaties and legislation that have direct or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the relationship between European Union law and laws of member states. Rule 4 applies because it clarifies that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is asking about the effect of European Union law on laws of member states. \nThe answer: European Union law has direct or indirect effect on the laws of member states.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that the three sources of European Union law are primary law, secondary law, and supplementary law. Size, shape, age, and color are not relevant concepts, and neither are profession and nationality or animals and vehicles.", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the legislature of the European Union is composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.\nThe answer: European Parliament and Council of the European Union", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage explicitly states that there are three sources of European Union law: primary law, secondary law, and supplementary law. This information is directly stated and does not require any inference or interpretation.\nThe answer: primary law, secondary law, and supplementary law.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the main sources of primary law in European Union law are the Treaties establishing the European Union. This falls under rule 3, which states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts.\nThe answer: The Treaties establishing the European Union.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (4) helps us identify that the question is asking about a governing body rather than a group of people. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" (16) helps us identify that the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are the two entities being referred to. \nThe answer: The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Primary law, secondary law, and supplementary law are the three sources of European Union law, as stated in the article. This falls under rule 3, which states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts.\nThe answer: three", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: European Union law is applied by the courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nThe answer: The courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A provides more rights than B, then B provides less rights than A. Rule 2 applies because it states that if A provides the most rights and B provides some or very few rights, then A provides the least rights and B provides the most rights. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about enforcement when member states provide lesser rights, which is a negation. \nThe answer: the courts of member states", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rule is that legal documents and treaties are different concepts (rule 3) and that negations are important for the answer (rule 17). The answer is \"Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\".", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is not relevant to this question, but the rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" is relevant because the question asks for the highest court in the European Union, which is a passive construction. Therefore, the answer is the European Court of Justice. \nThe answer: European Court of Justice", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage lists several sources of European Union law, including case law by the Court of Justice, international law, and general principles of European Union law. The question asks for one of these sources, so we can simply provide any one of them. \nThe answer: case law by the Court of Justice, international law, or general principles of European Union law.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: European Union law is applied by the courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union. \nThe answer: courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires knowledge of a specific treaty mentioned in the article. Rule 3 and 4 are not relevant to this question. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a treaty that allows the European Commission to take action against member states, implying that there may be some resistance or opposition from the member state. The answer is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \nThe answer: Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the European Court of Justice is the highest court in the European Union. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence \"The European Court of Justice is the highest court able to interpret European Union law\" is in the active voice, meaning that the European Court of Justice is the subject and the highest court is the predicate. Finally, the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" helps us eliminate any potential confusion between the European Court of Justice and other courts mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: European Court of Justice", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Supplementary sources of European Union law include case law by the Court of Justice, international law and general principles of European Union law.\nThe answer: case law by the Court of Justice, international law, general principles of European Union law", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: European Union law is applied by the courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nThe answer: courts of member states and the Court of Justice of the European Union", "{3, 4, 23}\nExplanation: European Union law can be enforced by the courts of member states and the European Commission can take proceedings against member states. The highest court able to interpret European Union law is the European Court of Justice. \nThe answer: Courts of member states and the European Commission.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 distinguishes between different concepts, including law and courts. Rule 16 establishes that \"highest\" comes before \"court.\" Rule 23 explains that the subject acts the verb in an active sentence, so the highest court is the European Court of Justice. \nThe answer: European Court of Justice", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that supplementary sources of European Union law include case law by the Court of Justice, international law, and general principles of European Union law. This fits with rule 3, which states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different. These rules help to clarify that case law, international law, and general principles are different concepts from European Union law itself. \nThe answer: case law by the Court of Justice, international law, and general principles of European Union law.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules that apply are rule 3 (different concepts), rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The question asks for the two primary constitutional sources of the European Union, which are the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).", "{3, 5, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and animals and vehicles are different concepts. Therefore, we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the EU's governance structure. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks who has the power to initiate legislation, so we can use this rule to eliminate any information about who can make amendments or must give consent for laws to pass. The answer is the European Commission. \nThe answer: The European Commission", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4), so the nationality of the members of the European Parliament is irrelevant to the answer. First comes before last (rule 16), so the answer is \"citizens\". \nThe answer: citizens", "{3, 4, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a specific court that has the power to interpret EU law. Rule 3 and 4 are relevant because they establish that concepts such as laws and institutions are different from each other, and that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 23 is also relevant because it explains that the subject of a passive sentence is acted upon the verb, which is important to understand the role of the European Court of Justice. \nThe answer: The European Court of Justice.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about who appoints the commissioners and board of the European Central Bank. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the governing body in question is the European Council. \nThe answer: European Council", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information related to these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Which treaty provides that the member states' non-metropolitan territories are not subject to European Union law?\" The answer is the Treaty on European Union (TEU).", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the TEU specifically excludes certain regions, then there are regions where the Treaty of European Union excludes from jurisdiction. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer is: Yes, the Faroe Islands are excluded from the jurisdiction of European Union law.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 distinguishes between different concepts, including laws and powers. Rule 16 establishes that first comes before last. Rule 23 explains that the Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties, but it cannot rule on their validity, which is subject to international law. \nThe answer: The Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties, but it cannot rule on their validity, which is subject to international law.", "{7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific instance where individuals can rely on primary law in the Court of Justice of the European Union. Rule 7 and 8 are relevant because they state that synonyms and antonyms are important for answering questions. In this case, the question uses the term \"instances\" which is a synonym for \"circumstances\" or \"conditions.\" Rule 17 is also relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. In this case, the question asks for a positive condition where individuals can rely on primary law, so it is important to note that any negative conditions would not be relevant. \nThe answer: If the Treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period. This is a straightforward answer to the question.\nThe answer: Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties, with the \"core\" treaties being the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This means that the TEU and TFEU are the most important treaties in the EU's primary law.\nThe answer: Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)", "{3, 4, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 12 (irrelevant passages), and 13 (names are equally important). The answer is: Gibraltar and the \u00c5land islands.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period.\nThe answer: as soon as they enter into force", "{rule list: 13, 23}\nExplanation: The Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties, as stated in the passage. This is an example of rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 23, which states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: The Court of Justice of the European Union", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the common rules for coal and steel and atomic energy were established before the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992, which provided more complete and formal institutions for the EU. Therefore, rules 3 and 16 are relevant. \nThe answer: Treaty of Rome 1957 and Maastricht Treaty 1992", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists the years in which various countries joined the European Union, so we can use rule 16 to determine that we need to look for Spain and Portugal specifically. Then, we can use rule 3 to determine that we need to focus on the years mentioned in the passage. The answer is 1985. \nThe answer: 1985", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Norway is mentioned as having joined the EU in 1972, but later it is mentioned that Norway failed to join due to lack of support in a referendum. This is an example of a contradiction that can be resolved by applying rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and rule 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). \nThe answer: No, Norway did not end up joining.", "{13, 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule of names being equally important for the answer tells us that the country's name is important. The rule of first comes before last and last comes after first tells us that the country mentioned last in the passage is not the answer. The rule of \"former\" referring to the first and \"latter\" to the last tells us that the country mentioned before 1985 is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is Greenland. \nThe answer: Greenland", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage lists several treaties that form the European Union, and the question specifically asks for the year that the Maastricht Treaty was signed. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the Maastricht Treaty was signed after the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" so we can identify that the sentence \"Minor amendments were made during the 1960s and 1970s\" is in the passive voice and does not provide the answer to the question. \nThe answer: 1992", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Single European Act was signed to complete the development of a single, internal market. This implies that it was signed after the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty. Therefore, we can infer that it was signed after 1992. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the Single European Act was signed after the Maastricht Treaty. Rule 23 tells us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question is in passive voice, so we need to convert it to active voice to determine the answer. The active version of the question is \"When did they make the Single European Act?\" The answer is: 1986.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1972", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). The sentence \"Greenland signed a Treaty in 1985 giving it a special status\" is in the active voice, so the subject (Greenland) performed the action (signed the Treaty). Therefore, the answer is: 1985.", "{rule list: 23, 24}\nExplanation: The passage describes a sequence of events, starting with the Nice Treaty and leading to the enactment of the Lisbon Treaty. The question asks for the timing of a specific event within that sequence, which requires understanding the timeline of events. Rules 23 and 24 are relevant because they help identify the passive voice in the sentence and understand the sequence of events. \nThe answer: Following the Nice Treaty", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the countries that curtailed a constitution for Europe, which means that the answer should be the countries that rejected the proposed 2004 Treaty. Rule 3 states that concepts such as location are important for the answer, so we need to look for the location of the referendums. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What two countries rejected the proposed 2004 Treaty?\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"never\" in the passage. \nThe answer: France and the Netherlands.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a comparison between the Lisbon Treaty and the proposed constitutional treaty. Rule 2 applies because the Lisbon Treaty and the constitutional treaty have a similar substance. Rule 8 applies because the similarity is expressed as a comparison between the two treaties. \nThe answer: very similar", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rules state that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" and \"negations are important for the answer.\" The question asks for the type of treaty that the Lisbon Treaty was, so size, shape, age, and color are not relevant. The answer is not a person or location, so gender and first/last do not apply. The answer is that the Lisbon Treaty was an amending treaty. \nThe answer: amending treaty", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 9, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B, is relevant because the question asks about whether the Lisbon Treaty would alter or replace existing treaties. Rule 16, which states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" is also relevant because it helps to clarify the meaning of the question. \nThe answer: The Lisbon Treaty significantly altered the existing treaties, but it did not completely replace them.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Nice Treaty led to an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the European Union and make it more transparent. \nThe answer: reforming the constitutional law of the European Union", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: producing a single constitutional document and making the constitutional law of the European Union more transparent", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the proposed reform did not come into force as a result of the referendums in France and the Netherlands. This is a negation and therefore rule 17 applies. Additionally, the question uses the word \"never\" which is also a negation. Finally, rule 3 applies as the reason for the reform not coming into force is not related to size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: Referendums in France and the Netherlands.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a treaty that replaced the proposed constitutional treaty. Rule 1 applies because the Lisbon Treaty had a similar substance to the proposed constitutional treaty. Rule 4 applies because the question is asking for a treaty, which is a different concept from a constitution. Rule 17 applies because the question is asking for a negation, specifically what treaty replaced the proposed constitutional treaty. \nThe answer: the Lisbon Treaty", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts and first coming before last and last coming after first are not relevant to this question. The relevant rules are that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, animals and vehicles are different concepts, and if two entities are listed, then \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last. The answer is: The European Commission.", "{3, 9, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, as stated in Article 17(2) of the Treaty on European Union. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (the Commission) is acted upon the verb (initiating). Therefore, the answer is the Commission. \nThe answer: The Commission", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work.\" Additionally, the article mentions that the Commissioners are appointed by member state governments, indicating that they are not the ones responsible for setting the agenda.\nThe answer: The Commission's President (Jean-Claude Juncker)", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of Commissioners for each member state is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if each member state has one Commissioner, then it is not possible for one member state to have more Commissioners than another. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer should be presented in the order of the question. \nThe answer: One.", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question asks for the current President and High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy of the European Commission. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can assume that the answer will be names rather than their respective countries. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the President's name will come before the High Representative's name. Rules 20 and 21 state that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, and \"his\" refers to male names and \"her\" refers to female names, respectively. \nThe answer: Jean-Claude Juncker and Federica Mogherini.", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if the article states that Commissioners should be \"completely independent\", then they should not take instructions from any government. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that the concepts of \"Commissioners\" and \"Government\" are different. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that the concept of \"nationality\" is different from the concept of \"profession\". Rule 8 is relevant because it establishes that if the article states that Commissioners should be \"completely independent\", then they should not take instructions from any government, and therefore they should not take instructions from any government more than any other Commissioner. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations in the article are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Article 17(3)", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Commission's President (currently Jean-Claude Juncker)", "{rule list: 23, 24}\nExplanation: Decisions on behalf of the EU are made by a simple majority vote, usually through a \"written procedure\" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections. The Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the \"de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives\". The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. \nThe answer: by a simple majority vote, usually through a \"written procedure\" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", and rule 22 states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\". In the passage, it is mentioned that \"Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states\". Therefore, the answer is Ireland. \nThe answer: Ireland.", "{13, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the Commissioners of the European Commission are appointed by member state governments and are therefore unelected subordinates. The rules selected clarify that gender and name are irrelevant to profession, and that the order of first and last is important. The rules also clarify that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: Commissioners of the European Commission", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the commission that was censured in 1999, which is the Santer Commission. The passage also mentions that this event paved the way for Commissioners to abuse their power, indicating that the Santer Commission's censure had negative consequences. Rules 3 and 4 are relevant because they remind us that \"commission\" refers to a group of people, not a government agency or committee. Rule 8 is relevant because it tells us that if a group A is censured, then it is being criticized or punished for something negative. Rule 17 is relevant because it tells us that negations are important for the answer, and the question uses the word \"not\" in the phrase \"was censured.\" \nThe answer: Santer Commission", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. This means that the defendant in the case of Commission v. Edith Cresson did not break any laws.\nThe answer: No.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Committee of Independent Experts", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the board of the European Central Bank is appointed by the European Council, on the Council's recommendation. This follows rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: The European Council", "{3, 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, but the question is about voting rights, which is related to the role of the President of the Council in the European Central Bank. Therefore, rule 4 is relevant. Rule 16 is relevant because it clarifies that the President of the Council is a different entity from the Commissioners mentioned earlier in the passage. Rule 23 is relevant because it explains that the European Central Bank has a separate structure and decision-making process from the Commission. \nThe answer: No, the President of the Council does not have voting rights in the European Central Bank.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999.\nThe answer: 1999", "{rule list: 2, 17, 22}\nExplanation: The Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, which eventually led to the resignation of the Commission due to corruption allegations. This resulted in the main case, Commission v Edith Cresson, where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did not break any law. \nThe answer: Commission v Edith Cresson", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the entity that found the culture of irresponsibility, which is a comparison between the Commissioners who had and who did not have a sense of responsibility. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the entity that found the culture of irresponsibility, which is a negation of the Commissioners having a sense of responsibility. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the entity that found the culture of irresponsibility, which is a negation of a positive trait. \nThe answer: Committee of Independent Experts", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office in response to the culture of irresponsibility and corruption among Commissioners found by the Committee of Independent Experts. The answer is European Anti-fraud Office. \nThe answer: European Anti-fraud Office", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the time when the European Anti-Fraud Office investigated John Dalli. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from time, so we can ignore any information about how long ago the investigation happened. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use it to infer that if the investigation happened after 1999 (when the Santer Commission was censured), then it happened after a time when Commissioners were found to have abused their offices. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the wording of the sentence. Putting these rules together, we can infer that the investigation happened after 1999, but we cannot infer a specific year. \nThe answer: after 1999.", "{4, 23}\nExplanation: The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. This is in accordance with the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10.", "{3, 5, 8, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so it is also irrelevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so in this case, if Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, it means that the Commission has more power than Parliament. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that Parliament cannot initiate legislation is crucial. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so the fact that Parliament cannot initiate legislation is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the answer should be a specific time frame. Rule 23 establishes that passive voice is used in the context paragraph, so the answer should be in passive voice as well. \nThe answer: Parliament elections take place every five years.", "{2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Parliament can censure the whole Commission by a two-thirds majority. \nThe answer: two-thirds", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The European Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, and the Council's consensus is required to legislate. Therefore, the Parliament must go through the Commission and the Council of the European Union first to pass legislation.\nThe answer: the Commission and the Council of the European Union", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: The Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, according to the passage. This is because of rule 1, which states that if A has more power than B, then B has less power than A. It is also supported by rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the Commission is an entity, not a profession or nationality.\nThe answer: The Commission", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. This is because they are different entities with different roles in the legislative process, as per rules 3 and 4. \nThe answer: The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.", "{16, 17, 22}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that the first direct elections for the European Parliament took place in 1979.\nThe answer: 1979", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage that \"Parliament elections, take place every five years\". This is a straightforward answer that can be found by knowing that elections for the European Parliament occur every five years.\nThe answer: every five years", "{16, 18}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest among political party lines in the European Parliament.\nThe answer: The European People's Party", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts such as size and profession, while Rule 4 separates profession and nationality. Rule 16 establishes that \"ministers of the member states\" attend and vote at Council meetings. \nThe answer: ministers of the member states", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the current President, implying that there have been previous Presidents. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for a specific position, not a nationality. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a current position, implying that the answer is not a former position. \nThe answer: Donald Tusk", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the size of member states is being used to determine the weight of their votes, so smaller states are not dominated by larger ones. Therefore, the answer is that the votes are weighted inversely to member state size.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from voting. The answer is not affected by negations or gender. \nThe answer: 352 votes", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept, so the number of votes needed for a majority is not affected by the total number of votes. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the number of votes needed for a majority, which is the opposite of a qualified majority vote. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific number. \nThe answer: 260 votes", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that first comes before last and last comes after first. These rules help us identify that the article is discussing two legislative bodies, with the second one being the Council. \nThe answer: The Council", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The European Council meets every six months. This is stated in the passage: \"It meets each six months.\" The relevant rules are 3 (age, shape, size, and color are different concepts) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first).", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept means that the total number of member states is not relevant to the answer. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first means that the number of votes (352) is the last piece of information given about the Council. Therefore, the answer is 352.", "{3, 8, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 23 states that TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define the qualified majority vote as at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU. \nThe answer: At least 55% of the Council members representing 65% of the population of the EU.", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that in the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" for most EU acts, the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes to the Commission's proposal. This is a combination of rules 1 and 2, as the question is asking about a comparison between blocking and suggesting changes, and rule 3, as the concept of voting is different from the concepts of size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: majority of all MEPs", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding the voting process in the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" defined in TFEU article 294. Rule 1 and 2 are relevant for understanding the voting requirements for the Council. Rule 3 is relevant for understanding that the article is discussing a legislative process. Rule 4 is relevant for understanding that the Council is a separate institution from the Parliament. Rule 8 is relevant for understanding that the question is asking for the antonym of \"block Commission amendment.\" \nThe answer: qualified majority", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the difficulty of changing EU law is compared to the difficulty of keeping it the same. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the antonym of \"easier.\" \nThe answer: Harder", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: TEU articles 4 and 5", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Court of Justice", "{1, 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that if the question asks for one type of legislation, then the answer should be a specific type and not a comparison. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that size, shape, age, and color are not relevant to the answer. Rule 12 is relevant because it clarifies that irrelevant passages in the context should be ignored. Rule 17 is relevant because it clarifies that negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: TFEU article 294", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the Parliament can block legislation with a majority vote, while the Council can block Commission amendments with a unanimous vote. Rule 2 applies because the legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about what can block legislation. \nThe answer: Parliament, Council, and Commission", "{3, 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: These rules establish that concepts such as \"powers\" and \"member states\" are different concepts, and that the order of the articles mentioned in the question is important. Rule 23 also helps to understand the structure of the sentence. \nThe answer: TEU articles 4 and 5", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about what happens if the institutions cannot come to a consensus, which implies that they are in disagreement. Rule 3 applies because the answer refers to a specific entity, the \"Conciliation Committee.\" Rule 16 applies because the question asks about a specific stage in the legislative process. \nThe answer: a \"Conciliation Committee\"", "{1, 4, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks about the branch of the EU that has had the most influence on the development of EU law. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a comparison between the different branches of the EU. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including branches of the EU. Rule 23 is relevant because it explains the difference between the active and passive voice, which is important for understanding the role of the judicial branch in interpreting and applying EU law. \nThe answer: The judicial branch of the EU.", "{1, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that if the question asks for the main judicial body, then the answer should not be the higher European Court of Justice or the General Court. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, and the question asks for the judicial body, not the country or region. Rule 8 is relevant because it clarifies that if the question asks for the main judicial body, then the answer should not be a subsidiary court like the Civil Service Tribunal or the Court of Auditors. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a positive answer, and negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that there is one judge from each member state, and there are currently 28 member states, so the total number of judges in the EU is 28. \nThe answer: 28", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. However, the order of the courts mentioned in the passage is relevant, so rule 16 applies. The passage states that most EU law is applied by member state courts, but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. Therefore, the answer is member state courts. \nThe answer: member state courts", "{3, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\". This duty is established in the context paragraph and is a straightforward statement of the court's role in interpreting and applying EU law. The relevant rules are 3 (to distinguish between concepts), 17 (to consider negations), and 23 (to understand the difference between active and passive voice). \nThe answer: To ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed.", "{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if the judicial branch assumes the task of interpreting the treaties, it can accelerate economic and political integration. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that the concept of EU law is different from the concept of national law. Rule 5 is relevant because it establishes that the judicial branch is different from other branches of the EU. Rule 7 is relevant because the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 8 is relevant because it establishes that if the judicial branch accelerates economic and political integration, it can also have adverse effects. Rule 9 is relevant because it establishes that if the judicial branch accelerates economic and political integration, it can also have antithetical effects. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. Rule 23 is relevant because it establishes that the judicial branch can expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. \nThe answer: The judicial branch of the EU accelerates economic and political integration by interpreting the treaties and", "{1, 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between the CJEU and the other judicial bodies mentioned in the article. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is important in understanding the composition of the CJEU. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes the order in which the different courts are mentioned in the article. Rule 23 is relevant because it explains the role of the CJEU in interpreting EU law. \nThe answer: The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)", "{4, 16, 22, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a profession. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the Civil Service Tribunal as a separate entity from the Court of Justice of the European Union and the General Court. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so we can eliminate the Court of Auditors as it was mentioned after the Civil Service Tribunal. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can identify \"EU staff issues\" as the object of the sentence and the Civil Service Tribunal as the subject. \nThe answer: Civil Service Tribunal", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 and 23. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the president is the first judge mentioned in the article. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that we need to look for an active sentence that mentions the president's term. The answer is: three years. \nThe answer: three years.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that the CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\". The use of the word \"ensure\" indicates that the CJEU has a responsibility to make sure that the law is followed. The use of the word \"observed\" indicates that the CJEU's duty is to ensure that the law is respected and adhered to. The use of the word \"although\" in the sentence following the statement of the CJEU's duty indicates that the CJEU has some discretion in expanding and developing the law, but this is not its primary duty. \nThe answer: The CJEU's duty is to ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as legal systems are different from concepts such as nationality or profession. Rule 16 states that in a passage with multiple events, the order in which they are listed matters. Rule 23 states that the subject of a sentence can either act the verb (active) or be acted upon by the verb (passive). The answer is: EU law has primacy over national law.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The nationalisation law was from 1962, and the Treaty was in force from 1958, so Costa had no claim.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1964 and 1968", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems, which include both national and globalizing legal systems.\nThe answer: The European Court of Justice and the highest national courts", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that \"Costa v ENEL\" is a case name and \"Costa\" is the last name of the person involved. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence \"He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome\" is in the active voice and \"a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267\" is in the passive voice. Therefore, the answer is: Costa v ENEL took place in an unspecified year.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the court that argued against the idea that the Treaty of Rome prevented energy nationalism. The passage explains that in the case of Costa v ENEL, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. Therefore, the answer is the Court of Justice.\nThe answer: Court of Justice", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that \"all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties.\" Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a concept, and \"precedence\" is a different concept than \"national law.\" \nThe answer: EU law", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Member states do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights.\nThe answer: foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that 'whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary'\". This is a passive sentence, so we need to identify the subject and verb to determine the answer. The subject is \"Parliament\" and the verb is \"enacted\". Therefore, the answer is \"1972\".\nThe answer: 1972", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding the concept of legitimacy and what factors contribute to it. Rule 3 is relevant because it emphasizes that concepts such as democracy and human rights are distinct from each other. Rule 4 is relevant because it emphasizes that nationality and profession are different concepts, which is important for understanding the role of member states in the EU. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains how to interpret comparative statements, which is important for understanding the relative importance of different factors in contributing to the EU's legitimacy. Rule 17 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of negations in the question, which is important for understanding that the answer is not what the EU's legitimacy does not rest on. \nThe answer: The EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for cases where the EU cannot override German law, indicating a negation. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 3 and 4 state that concepts such as \"law\" and \"nationality\" are different, so the answer must involve a conflict between EU law and German law. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the EU cannot override German law, then German law takes precedence over EU law. Therefore, the answer is: when the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles), it cannot override German law.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Constitutional law concerns the European Union's governance structure, while administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law. Therefore, the answer is administrative law.\nThe answer: administrative law", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This means that in 1986, there was a rule that prevented citizens or corporations from bringing claims against non-state parties. \nThe answer: 1986", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how EU institutions and member states can be held accountable for following the law, and that citizens and corporations can bring claims against them for violation of the Treaties and Regulations. It also mentions that all actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, particularly where general principles of law or fundamental rights are engaged. Therefore, rules 3, 4, and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: all actions by EU institutions", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Constitutional law concerns the governance structure of the European Union, which is a different concept from administrative law that binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law. \nThe answer: Constitutional law", "{rule list: 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage discussing the case of Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen, where it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective if they are clear, unconditional, and do not require further action by EU or national authorities to implement them. This is in accordance with rules 2, 8, and 17, which state that if A is X, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and negations in the question are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if an article states that a provision is in place, then the opposite is not true. Rule 2 is relevant because it establishes that if a provision is clear and unambiguous, then it is directly effective. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 8 is relevant because it establishes that if a provision is clear and unambiguous, then the opposite is also true. \nThe answer: TFEU article 30", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Van Gend en Loos is a company involved in postal services and transportation. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, and rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the type of company, which is a profession, and the passage describes Van Gend en Loos as a postal company, which is a nationality. Therefore, applying rule 8, we can say that Van Gend en Loos is not less than a postal company, which means it is a postal company. \nThe answer: Postal company", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: EU Regulations are directly applicable in all Member States and do not require further action to be implemented, making them essentially the same as Treaty provisions.\nThe answer: Treaty provisions", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and profession and nationality are different concepts according to Rule 4. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks what does not allow citizens to sue other citizens, so we are looking for a negative answer. Therefore, we can conclude that Directives do not generally give citizens standing to sue other citizens. \nThe answer: Directives", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific number, which is \"4 weeks.\" The passage states that the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as the difference between the Working Time Directive and national laws. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the Working Time Directive requires a minimum of 4 weeks, so any national laws requiring more than 4 weeks would be considered \"more X\" than the Directive. \nThe answer: 4 weeks", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it clarifies that the number of paid holiday days is not related to any of these concepts. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because it allows us to infer that if the Working Time Directive requires at least 4 weeks of paid holidays, then most member states require more than that. \nThe answer: more than 28 days", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period when the three Advocate Generals argued for a certain position. Rule 7 is relevant as the question contains a synonym for \"argued\" in \"persuasively argued\". Rule 16 is also relevant as the question asks for a specific time period. \nThe answer: in the early 1990s", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is not met, then B cannot enforce conflicting laws. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the consequence of a Directive's deadline not being met. \nThe answer: The member state cannot enforce conflicting laws.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws if the deadline for implementation is not met. Rule 2 applies because a citizen or company can invoke a Directive in a dispute with another citizen or company. Rule 17 applies because the answer is asking for the consequence of a Directive's deadline not being met. \nThe answer: A citizen or company can invoke a Directive in a dispute with another citizen or company.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage discussing the case of K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG, where it is mentioned that Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that first comes before last and last comes after first, which helps identify the specific person mentioned in the passage. Rule 23 is relevant because it explains that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, which is the case in the sentence mentioning Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci's dismissal. \nThe answer: 10 years", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc.\" The rule 16 helps to identify that \"Mrs Foster\" is a person and \"British Gas plc\" is a company. The rule 23 helps to understand that the sentence is in passive voice, so \"British Gas plc\" is the subject of the sentence and \"Mrs Foster\" is the object. \nThe answer: British Gas plc", "{rule list: 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65.\" The answer is 60. \nThe answer: 60.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the duty to interpret domestic law is a comparison between national and EU law. Rule 3 applies because the duty to interpret domestic law is related to the wording and purpose of the directive. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a duty, which is a negation. \nThe answer: national courts", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"wording\" and \"purpose\" are different from each other. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the First Company Law Directive article 11 required incorporations to only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons. Therefore, we can infer that the article required that incorporations not be nullified for any reason outside of that fixed list. \nThe answer: The First Company Law Directive article 11 requires incorporations to only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as required by the Insolvency Protection Directive.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 6 million Lira", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The European Court of Justice developed the principles of European Union Law.\nThe answer: The European Court of Justice", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage lists several accepted general principles of European Union Law, including fundamental rights, proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law, and subsidiarity.\nThe answer: fundamental rights, proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law, and subsidiarity.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the duration of time that proportionality has been recognized as a general principle of EU law. Rule 1 applies because it involves a comparison of time. Rule 8 applies because it involves a comparison of degree. The answer: since the 1950s.", "{rule list: 2, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The principle of proportionality is recognized in Article 5 of the EC Treaty.\nThe answer: Article 5 of the EC Treaty", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: When there is a choice between several appropriate measures, the least onerous must be adopted. This is an application of rule 2. Additionally, the question uses the word \"must,\" indicating a requirement, which implies a negation. Therefore, we also apply rule 8. \nThe answer: the least onerous", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that the concept of legal certainty has been recognized as one of the general principles of European Union law since the 1960s. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps to understand that \"recognized one of the general principles\" means that it is an established principle. Rule 16 is relevant because it helps to understand that the 1960s is before the present time. \nThe answer: since the 1960s.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: legal certainty as a general principle of international law and public law", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a requirement for the adoption of laws in the EU. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about those. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about those as well. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"must\" in the question. Combining these rules, we can determine that the answer is that the adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. \nThe answer: A proper legal basis.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the doctrine of legitimate expectation has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, which are both concepts in European Union law. \nThe answer: the principles of legal certainty and good faith", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 8 (antonyms), and 17 (negations). The question asks where the European Court of Justice is likely to get inspiration from, so we need to identify the source of inspiration. The passage states that the Court is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states, but it cannot uphold measures that are incompatible with fundamental rights recognized and protected in the constitutions of member states. Therefore, the Court is likely to get inspiration from the constitutional traditions and fundamental rights recognized in the member states. The answer is member states' constitutional traditions and fundamental rights.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two things that are opposite in terms of a certain characteristic. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because it states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: fundamental rights recognized and protected in the constitutions of member states.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that at the time of the establishment of the European Union, the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights. This implies that the member states were the entities originally concerned with preventing violation of human rights.\nThe answer: member states", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1950", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The European Court of Human Rights", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time-related event, so rule 16 is relevant. The passage provides a clear timeline of events, so rule 3 is also relevant. Finally, the question asks for a specific action taken by a governing body, so rule 23 is also relevant. \nThe answer: 1999", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"The 2007 Lisbon Treaty\" recognized fundamental rights. Therefore, the Lisbon Treaty was established in 2007.\nThe answer: 2007", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. First comes before last and last comes after first, so the Lisbon Treaty is the charter that has become an important aspect of EU law.\nThe answer: Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses the relationship between the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any rules related to professions or occupations. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can eliminate any rules related to pronouns or gender. The answer is \"European Union law\". \nThe answer: European Union law", "{3, 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks about the entity that enforces the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"rights\" are different from concepts such as \"entities\". Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the question cannot be answered by identifying a person or country. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we can identify the European Court of Justice as the entity that enforces the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can identify the European Court of Justice as the entity that enforces the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. \nThe answer: The European Court of Justice.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because the question asks for the name of a specific treaty. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" is relevant because the question asks for the name of a chapter within a treaty, which is a passive construction.\nThe answer: Treaty of Amsterdam", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because the Treaty of Amsterdam is the first thing mentioned in the passage, and the year it was created is the last piece of information given. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" is also relevant because the question asks for the year the Treaty of Amsterdam was created, which is the action being performed in the passive sentence \"The Social Chapter is a chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam.\" \nThe answer: 1997", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when the basis for the Social Chapter was developed, which is a specific event in the past. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the absence of negations in the question. Rule 22 tells us that \"toned down version\" refers to the Social Charter, which was adopted in 1989. Therefore, the basis for the Social Chapter was developed in 1989.\nThe answer: 1989", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that \"The Social Charter declares 30 general principles\". Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as size, shape, and number. Rule 12 is relevant because it allows us to ignore irrelevant information in the passage. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: 30", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the Social Charter became the basis for European Community legislation on social policy issues in 40 pieces of legislation.\nThe answer: 40", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The Social Charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states.\" This means that 11 member states adopted the Social Charter in 1989.\nThe answer: 11", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the UK refused to sign the Social Charter is not related to its nationality. However, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, all member states except the UK signed the Social Charter, so the UK is the only member state that declined to sign it. \nThe answer: UK", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it is stated that the Social Charter was vetoed from being included as the \"Social Chapter\" of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. The negation in the question is important to note, as it asks for the title that the Social Charter was set to be included under, not the title it was actually included under. Therefore, rules 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 8 (antonyms), and 17 (negations) are relevant.\nThe answer: Social Chapter", "{rule list: 16, 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year, which is a numerical value and therefore not covered by rules related to concepts such as size, shape, or profession. Rules 16 and 22 establish the order of events and clarify the meaning of \"the 1992 Maastricht Treaty\". Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"not signed\"), which is important for understanding the answer.\nThe answer: 1992", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Following the election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997, the UK formally subscribed to the Agreement on Social Policy\". The word \"following\" indicates that the event mentioned in the first part of the sentence (the election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997) led to the UK subscribing to the Agreement on Social Policy. The use of the word \"subsequently\" indicates that the UK adopting the main legislation previously agreed under the Agreement on Social Policy was a consequence of subscribing to it. Therefore, rules 4 and 17 are relevant, as they state that profession and negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Following the election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997, the UK formally subscribed to the Agreement on Social Policy\" is in active voice, with \"the UK\" as the subject and \"formally subscribed\" as the verb. Therefore, we can determine that the UK subscribed to the Agreement on Social Policy in 1997. \nThe answer: 1997", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from other concepts is irrelevant to this question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps us identify which directive is being referred to. \nThe answer: The 1994 Works Council Directive.", "{3, 10, 16}\nExplanation: We only need to focus on the specific sentence that mentions the Parental Leave Directive and its creation. Contractions and typos are irrelevant. We use rule 3 to identify that \"creation\" is different from \"adoption\" mentioned earlier in the paragraph. We use rule 10 to ignore the irrelevant information about the EU's policy initiatives. We use rule 16 to identify that \"1996\" comes before \"the 10 years following the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam.\" \nThe answer: 1996", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The Works Council Directive is a piece of social policy legislation that requires workforce consultation in businesses. This falls under the concept of labor and industry relations, which is different from equal opportunity, health and safety, public health, protection of children, the disabled and elderly, poverty, migrant workers, education, training, and youth. \nThe answer: Workforce consultation in businesses.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the European Coal and Steel Community agreement was between France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany.\nThe answer: France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that the ECSC agreement was established in 1951, which is a simple fact that can be extracted by identifying the year mentioned in the sentence.\nThe answer: 1951", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size and other concepts are different, so the fact that article 65 banned something is not relevant to the size or shape of anything. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if article 65 banned something, then the answer is what it banned, but with the opposite meaning. Therefore, the answer is that article 65 banned cartels. \nThe answer: cartels (with the opposite meaning)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the article that made provisions for concentrations or mergers and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and not interchangeable. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can infer that the article that made provisions for concentrations or mergers and the abuse of a dominant position by companies is article 66, as it is the only article mentioned in the passage that deals with these concepts. \nThe answer: Article 66.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article explains that competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome in 1957. This is a straightforward answer that can be found by identifying the relevant date in the passage.\nThe answer: 1957", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements, then it also prohibits price fixing. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements is included in Article 101(1). Rule 8 applies because it clarifies that any such agreements are automatically void. \nThe answer: Article 101(1)", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing. This rule falls under rule 3, as it pertains to a specific concept (anti-competitive behavior) rather than size, shape, age, or color. It also falls under rule 4, as it pertains to a profession (business) rather than a nationality. Finally, it falls under rule 8, as it involves a comparison of two concepts (dominant position and non-dominant position). \nThe answer: Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Article 106 and 107 state that member states' rights to deliver public services may not be obstructed. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including public services and competition principles. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks about a negation. \nThe answer: Article 106 and 107", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Article 102 allows the European Council to regulate mergers between firms, as stated in the passage. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which helps identify that Article 102 is the relevant article. Rule 3 is also relevant because it establishes that different concepts, such as anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant position, are distinct and should not be confused. \nThe answer: Article 102", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The article states that the concept of a \"social market economy\" was only introduced into EU law in 2007.\nThe answer: 2007", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome in 1957. This means that it has been central for at least 64 years.\nThe answer: since 1957", "{2, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 2 states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, breaking down barriers to trade and enhancing the free movement of goods is meant to reduce consumer prices. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. \"Reduce consumer prices\" is a synonym for \"lower prices.\"\nThe answer: Lower prices", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the tension between free trade and other values such as public health, consumer protection, labor rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. The Treaties limit free trade to prioritize these values. Negations in the question are important, as the answer is what the Treaties limit, not what they allow. The irrelevant information in the passage is that free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957, and the stages of a free trade area leading to a federal state. The answer: the Treaties limit free trade to prioritize public health, consumer protection, labor rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for an entity that has taken a certain view, which implies a positive statement. Therefore, we need to consider negations in the answer. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms, so we can look for synonyms of \"entity\" and \"view\" in the passage. The relevant sentence is \"Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.\" Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to negate the question to get the correct answer. The answer is: The Court of Justice. \nThe answer: The Court of Justice.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The EU achieves free movement of goods through a customs union and the principle of non-discrimination. Duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect are prohibited between member states. This means that any \"trading rules\" enacted by member states that could hinder trade directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, would be caught by article 34. Justifications for restrictions on trade include public morality, policy or security, protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants, national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value, industrial and commercial property, and environmental protection. The measures taken must be applied proportionately. \nThe answer: a customs union and the principle of non-discrimination.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so in this case, if article 34 prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect, then it discriminates against any \"trading rules\" that could hinder trade directly or indirectly, actually or potentially. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer is: article 34 discriminated against any \"trading rules\" that could hinder trade directly or indirectly, actually or potentially.", "{3, 8, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so in this case, if a trading rule enacted by a member state could hinder trade directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, it would be caught by article 34. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so it is relevant to note that article 34 prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect between member states. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so it is relevant to note that article 34 meant that states could be responsible for private actors hindering trade. \nThe answer: private actors hindering trade.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Commission v France", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage that discusses the case of Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, where the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34. This rule applies because it involves a specific requirement about a product's content. \nThe answer: 25%", "{rule list: 1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the German law had a greater negative effect on imports than domestic products. Rule 3 applies because the article discusses different types of products and their regulations. Rule 8 applies because the German liqueurs were over 25% alcohol, but the Cassis de Dijon that Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France only had 15 to 20% alcohol. \nThe answer: France", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2003", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"color\" is a different concept from \"content\" means that the answer cannot be \"cocoa\". The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" means that the answer cannot be \"other vegetable fats\". Therefore, the answer is \"cocoa butter alone\". \nThe answer: cocoa butter alone", "{3, 8, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 distinguishes between different concepts, including goods and practical effects on imports. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 emphasizes the importance of negations in the question. Rule 23 explains the difference between active and passive sentences. \nThe answer: a law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "{1, 2, 7, 8}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and how they can be flipped or modified. Rule 7 is relevant because the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 8 is relevant because it deals with negations. The answer: Keck and Mithouard.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the aim of the French competition law, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"aim,\" which is a synonym for \"purpose.\" Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"was,\" indicating a past tense and a possible negation. \nThe answer: The aim of the French competition law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about a specific case where the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12, which is a restriction on marketing and advertising. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is also not relevant. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because the question asks about bans on advertising to young children, which is a restriction. \nThe answer: Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific directive related to marketing and advertising, so rule 3 (different concepts) and rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) are not relevant. However, rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) is relevant because the question asks for the name of a directive that restricts marketing and advertising. The answer is also found in the last sentence of the passage, which mentions the \"Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.\" \nThe answer: Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers as a \"factor of production\". \nThe answer: The European Community", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that free movement originally focused on the free movement of workers as a \"factor of production\", but from the 1970s, it shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe, with free movement increasingly based on \"citizenship\". Therefore, the answer is citizenship. \nThe answer: citizenship", "{3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the case of a German man who claimed the right to live in the Netherlands while volunteering as a plumber.

Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the article defines a \"worker\" as anyone who is economically active, including those who are not paid in money. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: the right to stay in the Netherlands.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the articles that set out the provisions on equal treatment of workers. Rule 3 states that concepts such as profession and nationality are different, so the answer cannot be related to nationality. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer must be related to profession. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so we can assume that articles 1 to 7 are the first articles of the regulation. Therefore, the answer is articles 1 to 7.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jean-Marc Bosman", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the language requirement for teaching in a Dublin college.

This falls under rule 1, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts. The answer is citizenship of the EU.", "{1, 4, 5}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the status of EU citizenship before and after, indicating an increase. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between citizenship and nationality. Rule 5 applies because it distinguishes between social services and education. \nThe answer: access to social services and higher education", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific case where the Court made a ruling. Rule 3 states that age and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any information about age. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"Austria was not allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusively for Austrian students.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative language in the passage.

Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including \"practice law\" and \"registering in Milan.\" Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Rule 17 is relevant because it explains that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice law would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, \"justified by imperative requirements in the general interest\" and proportionately applied.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific case where the Court of Justice made a ruling about a lawyer being refused admission to the Belgian bar because of their nationality. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is important to note in understanding the question.

The answer is Reyners v Belgium. \nThe answer: Reyners v Belgium", "{3, 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage that states \"TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise 'official authority'\". Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as \"rights for workers\" and \"freedom of establishment\". Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as \"member state government\" and \"private party\". Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the answer is referring to a specific article within the TFEU. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Article 49.", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the case in which the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. Rule 3 is relevant to distinguish between the different concepts mentioned in the passage. Rule 4 is relevant to distinguish between the concepts of profession and nationality. Rule 8 is relevant to understand that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 is relevant to understand that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Commission v Italy", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the year when a toxic waste spill prompted the Commission to look into legislation against waste. The relevant information is given in the first sentence of the article, which states that the spill occurred in 2006. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"aside from\"), which means that the answer cannot be the accusative case mentioned in the passage. Rule 22 is also relevant because the question asks for a specific year. \nThe answer: 2006", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste,\" which means that Spain did not have a law against shipping toxic waste. \nThe answer: Shipping toxic waste", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: October 2007", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2005", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about who the freedom to provide services applies to, which is a comparison between different entities.

Rule 4 applies because the article mentions the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company, which is a specific company and not a nationality. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negative statement (\"could not evade tax\") and this negation is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Daily Mail", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the amount of capital required to start a company is a different concept from the name of the company or its location. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Denmark's minimum share capital rules required more capital than UK law, then UK law required less capital than Denmark's minimum share capital rules. \nThe answer: \u00a31", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts, including different types of clothing. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which applies to the difference in minimum share capital rules between the UK and Denmark. Rule 16 establishes that first comes before last and last comes after first, which clarifies that Denmark's minimum share capital rules required 200,000 Danish krone. \nThe answer: 200,000 Danish krone.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labor rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes. Additionally, the article notes that the Court of Justice held that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business without infringing TFEU article 49, which suggests that there may be other justifications for such restrictions. \nThe answer: creditor protection, labor rights, public interest in collecting taxes", "{rule list: 2, 8, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific case where the Court of Justice made a ruling. Therefore, rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant to identify the case being referred to. Rule 2 (if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X) and rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A) are relevant to understand that the ruling was in favor of the Dutch building company and against the German court. Rule 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb) is relevant to identify the passive construction \"the Court of Justice held\" as the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule about size (3) applies because the question is asking for a measurement of the rainforest's coverage. The rule about first and last (16) applies because the article lists multiple countries and their percentages of rainforest coverage. \nThe answer: 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi)", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Amazon basin encompasses territory belonging to nine nations, and then lists those nations. \nThe answer: Nine.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. We use rule 16 to determine that first comes before last and last comes after first. The answer is four.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the percentage of the planet's remaining rainforests that the Amazon represents, which is a comparison between the size of the Amazon and the size of all remaining rainforests. Therefore, we apply rule 3 to separate size from other concepts and rule 8 to understand that if the Amazon represents more than half of the planet's remaining rainforests, then all other remaining rainforests represent less than half. \nThe answer: over half", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"languages are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion between the different names for the Amazon rainforest in different languages. The answer is \"Amazoneregenwoud\".\nThe answer: Amazoneregenwoud", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a rainforest that covers most of the Amazon basin in South America. The passage provides the answer: the Amazon rainforest. Rule 3 applies to clarify that \"Amazon\" refers to the name of the rainforest and not the name of a river or other entity. Rule 16 applies to clarify that \"Amazon\" refers to the first entity listed in the sentence, which is the rainforest, and not any of the other entities listed (such as nations or departments). \nThe answer: the Amazon rainforest", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Amazon rainforest is the largest and most biodiverse rainforest in the world is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"In which country is the least amount of the Amazon rainforest found?\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the first country mentioned, Brazil, contains the majority of the rainforest. \nThe answer: Brazil", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from others, so we cannot assume that the Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest on Earth. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the Amazon rainforest is not the only rainforest on Earth. \nThe answer: over half", "{3, 12, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and names are equally important for the answer. The passage about the different countries and territories where the Amazon rainforest is located is irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: 16,000 species.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the type of forest that the Amazon rainforest is. The relevant rules are 3 and 4, which state that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and that profession and nationality are different concepts. Therefore, the answer is simply \"moist broadleaf forest\". \nThe answer: moist broadleaf forest", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Amazon basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometers, of which 5,500,000 square kilometers are covered by the rainforest. Therefore, the answer is 7,000,000 square kilometers.\nThe answer: 7,000,000 square kilometers", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The answer is \"nine\" because the passage states that the Amazon basin includes territory belonging to nine nations. \nThe answer: nine", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept applies because the question is asking about the nation that contains the majority of the forest, not the size of the forest itself. The rule that first comes before last applies because the question is asking specifically about one nation. \nThe answer: Brazil", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: We need to extract a specific number from the article, so rule 3 (size is a different concept from others) is relevant. Rule 10 (typos in the question are irrelevant) is also relevant. Rule 17 (negations are important) is not relevant. \nThe answer: 16,000 species.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the type of climate that allowed the rainforest to spread, which implies that there was a climate change that facilitated this expansion. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the size or shape of the rainforest. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the opposite of the climate that allowed the rainforest to spread would have prevented its expansion. Therefore, the answer is a wetter climate. \nThe answer: wetter climate", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics.\" This means that changes in climate have allowed for the expansion of the savanna region into the tropics.\nThe answer: Climate fluctuations", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period when the rainforest spanned a narrow band. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from size or shape, so we can ignore the age information in the passage. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"During what time did the rainforest span a relatively wide band?\" \nThe answer: the Oligocene", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the rainforest expanded during the Middle Miocene and then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. This means that the rainforest retracted to an inland formation after the Middle Miocene but before the last glacial maximum.\nThe answer: During the last glacial maximum.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question contains the word \"managed,\" which implies doubt or uncertainty. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question contains the word \"glacial,\" which is the opposite of \"tropical.\" The rule that \"negations in the question are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question contains the word \"did,\" which is a negation. \nThe answer: Yes, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that the extinction of the dinosaurs and wetter climate may have allowed the rainforest to spread across South America. This implies that the rainforest was not as widespread before these events, and therefore, the rainforest growth was caused by these factors.\nThe answer: The extinction of the dinosaurs and wetter climate.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific degree measurement, which is a size concept. Rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, so we can't assume that the rainforest reached a certain shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the rainforest did not reach further south than 45\u00b0. \nThe answer: 45", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics.\" This implies that changes in climate have caused the expansion of savanna regions into the South American tropics.\nThe answer: climate fluctuations", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that during the Oligocene period, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from size or shape, so we can infer that \"period\" refers to a specific time in history. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the rainforest expanded again during the Middle Miocene, we can infer that it was not a narrow band during that time. \nThe answer: Oligocene", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: expanded", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event allowed for the expansion of the rainforest. This event caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and created a wetter climate, which may have allowed the rainforest to spread. \nThe answer: Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that from 66-34 Mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45\u00b0. Therefore, the answer is 66 million years ago. \nThe answer: 66 million years ago.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the rainforest expanded again during the Middle Miocene.\" This means that after the Oligocene period, the rainforest began to expand during the Middle Miocene period.\nThe answer: Middle Miocene", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the rainforest retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. The question asks for the global event that caused this. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so the fact that the rainforest became mostly inland is not the same as a global event. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Applying this rule, we can infer that the global event that caused the rainforest to become mostly inland was the last glacial maximum. \nThe answer: last glacial maximum", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics.\" This means that savannah areas have been expanding over the last 34 million years.\nThe answer: 34 million years", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"During the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch.\" This means that the split occurred during the mid-Eocene period. \nThe answer: mid-Eocene", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic,\" indicating that the water flowed in an easterly direction towards the Atlantic Ocean. \nThe answer: easterly direction towards the Atlantic", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the creation of a large basin that enclosed a lake, which is now known as the Solim\u00f5es Basin. The name of the basin created from the enclosed lake is the Solim\u00f5es Basin.\nThe answer: Solim\u00f5es Basin", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Within the last 5\u201310 million years, this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch,\" indicating that the event occurred between 5 and 10 million years ago.\nThe answer: 5-10 million years ago", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location where the water joined in the direction of its flow. Rule 3 states that location is an important concept. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, so the location where it joined in the direction of its flow would be the Atlantic. \nThe answer: the Atlantic", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: during the mid-Eocene", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3, which states that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts,\" is relevant because it clarifies that the direction of water flow is not referring to a physical object. Rule 8, which states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A,\" is also relevant because the question asks for the direction of water flow to the east, which is the opposite of the direction of water flow to the west. \nThe answer: Atlantic", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 is relevant because it states that \"drainage basin\" and \"water flow\" are different concepts. Rule 8 is also relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks where water to the west of the Amazon drainage basin flowed towards, so the answer is the antonym of \"east\", which is \"west\".\nThe answer: towards the Pacific", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" apply here. The passage states that during the mid-Eocene, the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch, and water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin. Therefore, the answer is that water that flowed towards the Pacific had to flow across the Purus Arch during the mid-Eocene. \nThe answer: the Purus Arch", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Andes Mountains rising created a large basin that enclosed a lake, which is now known as the Solim\u00f5es Basin.\nThe answer: Solim\u00f5es Basin", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"During the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch.\" This means that the split likely occurred during the mid-Eocene period.\nThe answer: mid-Eocene", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that during the mid-Eocene, the Amazon drainage basin was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch. \nThe answer: The Amazon basin split near the middle of the continent.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the eastern side of the Amazon basin was the first side mentioned in the passage. Therefore, the answer is: toward the Atlantic.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"direction\" is a different concept from \"location\" applies here, as the question is asking about the direction of water flow rather than the location of the Amazon Basin. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" also applies, as the question is asking about the opposite direction of water flow from the one mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: The question is asking for the opposite direction of water flow, so the answer is towards the Pacific.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the Solim\u00f5es Basin.\" This indicates that the lake created by the rise of the Andes Mountains is known as the Solim\u00f5es Basin.\nThe answer: Solim\u00f5es Basin", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: LGM stands for Last Glacial Maximum, which refers to a period of time during the last ice age. This information is given in the first sentence of the article. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb), as they help identify the meaning of the acronym. \nThe answer: Last Glacial Maximum", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The analysis from the sediment deposits indicated that rainfall in the Amazon basin during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes a debate among scientists about whether the Amazon rainforest was significantly reduced during the Last Glacial Maximum. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland, while others argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. The use of the word \"debate\" and the phrase \"both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data\" indicate that there are differing opinions among scientists. \nThe answer: Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland, while others argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that there is a debate over whether the Amazon rainforest was significantly reduced during the Last Glacial Maximum or remained largely intact but extended less far. The debate has been difficult to resolve due to practical limitations in data sampling. The passage also notes that both explanations are reasonably well supported by available data. Therefore, the answer is that the debate has not been resolved. \nThe answer: not been resolved", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 21,000 years", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that there have been changes in the Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. The reduction in rainfall during the LGM was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. Therefore, the answer is the reduction in rainfall during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The article discusses analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan to compare rainfall in the basin during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present day. This is the only relevant information to answer the question.\nThe answer: sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin.\" Therefore, the lower rainfall in the Amazon during the LGM has been attributed to reduced moist tropical vegetation cover.\nThe answer: reduced moist tropical vegetation cover", "{rule list: 3, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period, which is mentioned in the article as \"the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation.\" The use of \"since\" in the question indicates a negation, which is important to consider. Typos and contractions are irrelevant. \nThe answer: 21,000 years ago", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: sediment deposits", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that vegetation cover is a different concept from rainfall. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that reduced rainfall led to less moist tropical vegetation cover in the Amazon basin.\nThe answer: moist tropical vegetation cover", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it clarifies that the answer is not related to the physical characteristics of the rainforest. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because it helps to understand that the refugia were separated by something that is the opposite of isolation. \nThe answer: open forest and grassland", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The name of the satellite is mentioned directly in the first sentence of the passage, so we can use rule 13 to determine that names are equally important for the answer. Additionally, the question asks for the name of the satellite, which is a specific piece of information, so we can use rule 17 to determine that negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: CALIPSO", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of dust blown from the Sahara each year, which is a quantitative measure of size. Therefore, rule 3 applies, which states that size is a different concept from shape, age, and color. Additionally, the question asks for a specific amount, so rule 8 applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the amount of dust blown from the Sahara is a positive quantity, so the antonym is \"zero.\" \nThe answer: 182 million tons", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a measurement of distance, which falls under the concept of size. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from shape, age, and color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, if we know that the dust travels 1,600 miles across the Atlantic Ocean, we can say that it does not travel less than that distance. \nThe answer: 1,600 miles", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that 27.7 million tons (15%) of dust fall over the Amazon basin.\nThe answer: Amazon basin", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that 132 million tons of dust fall over the Amazon basin and 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the Caribbean Sea, past 75 degrees west longitude. Therefore, the total amount of dust that falls or is blown out of the Sahara is 132 + 43 = 175 million tons. The passage also states that 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the Sahara each year, so the amount of dust that remains in the air is 182 - 175 = 7 million tons.\nThe answer: 7 million tons", "{rule list: 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"NASA's CALIPSO satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the Sahara to the Amazon.\"\nThe answer: CALIPSO satellite", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of dust blown out of the Sahara each year, which is a quantitative measure. Therefore, rules 1 and 2 apply to ensure that the answer is given in the correct format. Rule 3 applies to ensure that other concepts, such as location and distance, are not confused with the amount of dust. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the amount of dust blown out, rather than the amount that falls in a specific location. \nThe answer: 182 million tons", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The answer requires knowledge of the amount of Saharan dust that falls over the Amazon basin, which is given in the passage as 27.7 million tons (15%) of the total 182 million tons of dust transported by wind from the Sahara each year. This information is not affected by any of the other rules. \nThe answer: 27.7 million tons (15%)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of Saharan dust that remains in the air over the Amazon each year. The passage states that 132 million tons of dust fall over the Amazon basin, leaving 132 million tons in the air. However, the passage also states that 15% of the dust falls over the Amazon, which means that 85% of the dust remains in the air. Therefore, the answer is 132 million tons multiplied by 85%, which is approximately 112.2 million tons.\nThe answer: approximately 112.2 million tons", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We apply rule 3 to determine that the amount of dust blown and falling on the Caribbean Sea is a different concept from the amount of dust falling over the Amazon basin. Then, we apply rule 8 to infer that the amount of dust blown and falling on the Caribbean Sea is the antonym of the amount of dust remaining in the air, which is 43 million tons. \nThe answer: 43 million tons", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a satellite that measured the amount of dust going to the Amazon. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a specific name in the article. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: CALIPSO", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: NASA", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to find the amount of windblown dust leaving the Sahara each year.

Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, the answer is 182 million tons.", "{3, 8, 12}\nExplanation: The question asks for a measurement of distance, which falls under the concept of size. Rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, so it is relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is relevant because the question asks for the distance across the Atlantic, not from one point to another. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages should be ignored. \nThe answer: 1,600 miles (2,600 km)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of Saharan dust that falls on the Amazon Basin, so we need to focus on that specific information in the passage. Rule 3 tells us that size and quantity are different concepts, so we need to be careful not to confuse them. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"How much Saharan dust falls on areas other than the Amazon Basin each year?\" Using the information in the passage, we can calculate that 27.7 million tons (15%) of dust fall over the Amazon basin, so the answer is 154.3 million tons (85%) of dust falls on areas other than the Amazon Basin each year. \nThe answer: 154.3 million tons", "{rule list: names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a book, which is a specific entity and therefore falls under the rule that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so any information about size is not relevant to information about other concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Meggers claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest, then the answer to the question is the antonym of \"maximum,\" which is \"minimum.\" \nThe answer: 0.52/sq mi", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that agriculture would be needed to host a larger population in the Amazon rainforest. This is a comparison between two things, and therefore rule 3 applies. Additionally, the question uses the phrase \"to host a larger population,\" which implies that a larger population cannot be sustained without certain conditions being met, and therefore rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: agriculture", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that size and population are different concepts (rule 3) is relevant because it explains that the poor soil in the Amazon rainforest does not necessarily mean that the region was sparsely populated. The rule that negations are important for the answer (rule 17) is relevant because the question asks for the opposite of what was previously believed. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B (rule 8) is relevant because the previous belief was that the region was sparsely populated, and the new findings suggest that it was densely populated. \nThe answer: Recent anthropological findings.", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage initially suggests that the Amazon rainforest was sparsely populated, but recent anthropological findings suggest otherwise. The question asks for the number of people who may have lived in the Amazon region during AD 1500. The passage provides the answer: \"Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500.\" The use of \"may have\" indicates uncertainty, but it is the closest estimate provided in the passage.\nThe answer: 5 million", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The belief that the Amazon rainforest was only sparsely populated was based on the idea that the poor soil made it impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture. This is an example of rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. It is also an example of rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the belief that the Amazon couldn't sustain a large population through agriculture implies that it had poor soil, which is the opposite of fertile soil that could sustain a large population. \nThe answer: Poor soil", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of an archaeologist who believed that the Amazon rainforest was sparsely populated. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that Betty Meggers is referred to as an archaeologist in the article. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a name associated with the idea that the Amazon was not densely populated. \nThe answer: Betty Meggers", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size and population are different concepts, so the number of inhabitants is not related to the size of the area. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Meggers believed that 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre was the maximum sustainable population density, then the answer is that she believed that each square kilometre of the Amazon could sustain a maximum of 0.2 inhabitants.\nThe answer: 0.2", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the idea was \"thought for a long time\", implying that it was a widely held belief. Rule 3 applies because the archaeologist's theory is related to the ability of the soil to sustain agriculture. Rule 13 applies because the question specifically asks for the name of the archaeologist. \nThe answer: Betty Meggers", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a book, which is a specific type of entity. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we should look for a specific book title mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the maximum population density, which implies that a higher density is not sustainable. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves the concept of population density, which is different from the concepts of soil quality or agriculture. \nThe answer: 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi)", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage provides conflicting information about the population density of the Amazon rainforest, with Betty Meggers claiming a low population density and recent anthropological findings suggesting a dense population. The question asks for the estimated population in 1500 AD, which is provided as 5 million people. The relevant rules are 3 (size is a different concept from other concepts), 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A), and 17 (negations are important for the answer).\nThe answer: 5 million", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.\" This means that the population of the Amazon region in the 1980s was less than 200,000.\nThe answer: less than 200,000", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Francisco de Orellana", "{1, 2, 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that Francisco de Orellana observed a complex civilization flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. The question asks during what time this civilization was flourishing. Rules 1 and 2 help to understand that the civilization was flourishing during the 1540s, which is the time when Orellana made his observations. Rule 3 helps to avoid confusion with other concepts such as location or age. Rule 12 helps to focus on the relevant part of the passage.\nThe answer: in the 1540s", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the civilization along the Amazon was devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe, such as smallpox.

The rule that \"typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer\" is also not relevant. The answer can be found in the sentence \"The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species,\" which directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 2.5 million", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" means that the number of bird species in the Amazon rainforest is not compared to any other region or habitat. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" means that if one in five of all bird species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest, then four in five of all bird species in the world do not live in the Amazon rainforest. \nThe answer: one in five", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"at least 40,000 plant species\" have been scientifically classified in the region. \nThe answer: At least 40,000 plant species.", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" means that the number of fish species living in the Amazon is not related to the number of other types of species mentioned in the article.

Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can conclude that the Amazon region is home to more than one species of insect.\nThe answer: More than 2.5 million.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: We need to identify the number of bird and mammal species in the Amazon region.

The passage mentions piranha as a fish that can bite and injure humans.\nThe answer: piranha", "{3, 5, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule about different concepts (3) is relevant because it distinguishes between the size, shape, age, and color of the dart frogs and the toxins they secrete. The rule about different concepts (5) is also relevant because it distinguishes between animals (the dart frogs) and vehicles. The rule about synonyms (7) is relevant because \"secrete\" is a synonym for \"produce\" and \"release.\" The rule about names (13) is not relevant in this case because there are no names mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: lipophilic alkaloid toxins", "{rule list: 4, 7, 13, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific type of bat that spreads rabies, which is mentioned in the passage as \"vampire bats.\" The rules of profession and nationality (4) and gender (20, 21) are not relevant to this question, but the rules of entities (13) and synonyms (7) are important for identifying the correct answer. \nThe answer: vampire bats", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article defines deforestation as the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas, which is the process of removing trees from a forest.\nThe answer: deforestation", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that access to the forest's interior was highly restricted prior to the early 1960s. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (access) is acted upon the verb (restricted). Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"prior to the early 1960s\" refers to the time before that era.\nThe answer: Prior to the early 1960s.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: slash and burn method", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that colonists in the Amazon were unable to manage their fields and crops due to the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion.

The answer is that Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture.\" This means that 70% of the land cleared in the Amazon is used for growing livestock.\nThe answer: 70%", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the purpose of the highways built in the Amazon rainforest. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse concepts, so we need to focus on the purpose of the highways and not on the effects they had. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we need to focus on the profession of the farmers and not their nationality. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms, so we need to look for synonyms of \"soy farmers\". Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant, so we can ignore the information about deforestation rates. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important, so we need to pay attention to the word \"controversial\". \nThe answer: soy farmers", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the article states that the first two highways \"successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation.\" This means that before the highways were created, there was less settlement and deforestation. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" does not apply because none of these concepts are relevant to the question.\nThe answer: increased settlement and deforestation", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to extract the rate of clearing of forest from the passage. The passage states that the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 was 22,392 km2 or 8,646 sq mi per year. Therefore, the answer is 8,646 sq mi per year.

Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so we can ignore the information about the first two highways opening up the rainforest. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Did the rate of deforestation increase or decrease between 2004 and 2014?\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negation in the question. \nThe answer: deforestation declined significantly.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a comparison between the deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 and the previous five years, which would be 1995 to 2000. This is a comparison of two time periods, so we apply rule 1. The answer is that the deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 was 18% higher than the rate from 1995 to 2000.\nThe answer: 18% higher.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that environmentalists are concerned about \"loss of biodiversity\" and \"release of the carbon contained within the vegetation.\" Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that \"loss of biodiversity\" refers to the variety of species in the forest. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that \"release of carbon\" refers to the retention of carbon in the forest. \nThe answer: biodiversity and carbon stores.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Environmentalists are concerned about the loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest.\nThe answer: destruction of the forest", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of confusion between the carbon and the forest itself. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to understand that the concern is about the release of carbon, which could accelerate global warming. \nThe answer: carbon", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What amount of the world's carbon is not stored in the Amazon forest?\" The answer is 90% of the world's carbon. \n\nThe answer: 90%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Amazonian evergreen forests account for 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems, which is approximately 1.1 \u00d7 1011 metric tonnes of carbon.\nThe answer: approximately 1.1 \u00d7 1011 metric tonnes of carbon.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a change that may make the rainforest unsustainable, implying that the current conditions are sustainable. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves a concept of sustainability, which is different from size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 applies because the answer involves a comparison between current and future conditions. \nThe answer: severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is a negation of the statement \"the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures.\" The word \"could\" indicates uncertainty, so we need to consider negations. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as irrelevant. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the answer is \"non-greenhouse gas emissions.\" Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to include the word \"non\" in our answer.\nThe answer: non-greenhouse gas emissions.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If one computer model shows the Amazon rainforest becoming unsustainable and leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover by 2100, then it can be inferred that by 2100 there would be a nearly complete loss of rainforest in the Amazon basin.\nThe answer: 2100", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a potential decrease in the Amazon rainforest, which is a comparison of its current state to a future state. Rule 3 applies because size and sustainability are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a potential threat, which is a negation. \nThe answer: through the 21st century", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the main threats, implying that there may be multiple threats. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for different concepts, and threats can be different concepts from the rainforest itself. Rule 7 applies because the question asks for synonyms of \"threats.\" The answer is: climate change and deforestation.", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. The question asks about the type of territories being destroyed by ecocide in the Amazon, which is a matter of size and shape, not of animals or vehicles. Therefore, rule 3 applies. The answer is \"indigenous territories\". \nThe answer: indigenous territories", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: community-based conservation efforts", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that indigenous territories are being destroyed by deforestation and ecocide. The use of \"such as\" indicates that these are just examples and there may be other ways as well. However, since the question asks for \"largely\" destroyed, we can assume that these two ways are the most significant. \nThe answer: deforestation and ecocide", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Urarina as one group struggling to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories. The question asks for another group, which is not explicitly mentioned in the passage but can be inferred from the context as \"other indigenous peoples' rainforest communities.\" \nThe answer: other indigenous peoples' rainforest communities", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for an indigenous group in the Amazon that is gaining increased attention. The relevant information in the article is that \"the Urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories.\" This indicates that the Urarina are the indigenous group in question. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as size, shape, age, and color, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 is relevant because the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, and \"interest\" is a synonym for \"attention.\" Rule 12 is relevant because some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, and the information about non-human primates and community-based conservation efforts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 is relevant because names are equally important for the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because negations are important for the answer, and the question is asking for a group that is gaining attention, not one that is disappearing. \nThe answer: Urarina", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions the use of \"remote sensing\" and \"handheld GPS devices\" to map out tribal lands. \"Remote sensing\" is a synonym for \"sending technology.\" \nThe answer: remote sensing", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Trio Tribe", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how members of the Trio Tribe, who live in the rainforests of southern Suriname, use Google Earth to map out their ancestral lands. This indicates that tribal members living in the rainforests of southern Suriname are using Google Earth.\nThe answer: southern Suriname", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that members of the Trio Tribe use handheld GPS devices and programs like Google Earth to map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims. This means that they use Google Earth and GPS to map out their lands. \nThe answer: to map out their ancestral lands and strengthen their territorial claims.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that some indigenous tribes in the Amazon use remote sensing technology, such as handheld GPS devices and Google Earth, to map out their ancestral lands and strengthen their territorial claims. The reason they do this is to protect their lands from commercial interests, as many tribes in the Amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries, making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories. \nThe answer: To protect their tribal lands from commercial interests.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article discusses the importance of classifying tree growth stages in different parts of the Amazon forest in order to accurately map its biomass and carbon emissions. This question asks for what is being classified, which is the stages of tree growth.\nThe answer: tree growth stages", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial for accurately mapping the Amazon's biomass and subsequent carbon related emissions. Therefore, the classification is important for mapping carbon emissions.\nThe answer: carbon emissions", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is a person's name, which means that rule 13 applies. The relevant rule for finding the answer is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The answer is Tatiana Kuplich.\nThe answer: Tatiana Kuplich", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year in which a classification of trees in the Amazon was suggested. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can ignore the other details about the classification. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so we can assume that the year mentioned first in the passage is the one being referred to. \nThe answer: 2006", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The type of radar used is relevant to the answer, as well as the fact that it was used in combination with Thematic Mapper. However, the size, shape, age, and color of the trees are not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)", "{1, 7, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"worst\" implies a comparison. Rule 7 applies because \"recent history\" is a synonym for \"one hundred years.\" Rule 10 applies because typos are irrelevant. Rule 12 applies because the passage contains information that is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: 2005", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Names are equally important for the answer, so this rule is relevant. The Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research is an organization, so the answer is \"the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research.\" \n\nThe answer: the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for another factor besides drought that is pushing the rainforest towards a tipping point, so we can use the antonym of drought, which is wetness. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for another factor besides drought, so we can use the negation of \"not another factor,\" which is \"one other factor.\" \nThe answer: deforestation", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is discussing a potential outcome if the Amazon forest were to pass a tipping point and start to die. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, if the forest were to die, it would become a savanna or desert. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: savanna or desert", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the organization that made the prediction about the Amazon forest's survival in a drought. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so information about these concepts can be ignored. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"predicted\" can be replaced with \"reported\" or \"argued.\" Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the organization's name must be identified. \nThe answer: Woods Hole Research Center", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2010", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the affected region in the Amazon rainforest during the 2010 drought was approximately 1,160,000 square miles, which is a size measurement. The passage also lists the size of the affected region during the 2005 drought for comparison. Therefore, rules 3 and 16 are relevant.\nThe answer: 1,160,000 square miles", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the 2010 drought had \"three epicenters where vegetation died off.\" This indicates that there were three areas impacted by the death of vegetation.\nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that in 2005, the drought was focused on the southwestern part of the Amazon, while in 2010, the affected region was approximately 1,160,000 square miles. Therefore, the southern part of the Amazon forest was mainly impacted by drought in 2005.\nThe answer: 2005", "{3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the size of the Amazon rainforest is not relevant to the answer. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the information about the 2005 drought is not relevant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the relevant information as \"In a typical year the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide\". \nThe answer: 1.5 gigatons", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the common name of the phylum. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because it does not apply to the question. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" is not relevant because the question uses the exact phrase \"commonly known as\" to refer to the name of the phylum. The answer: comb jellies.", "{3, 6, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts such as size, shape, age, and color from the concept of where Ctenophora live. Rule 6 separates animals from vehicles, which is important because Ctenophora are animals. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and \"Ctenophora\" is the name of the animals in question.\nThe answer: Ctenophora live in marine waters worldwide.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from other characteristics mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in)", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Ctenophora is a phylum of marine animals that use groups of cilia called \"combs\" for swimming. They are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia and range in size from a few millimeters to 1.5 m. Their bodies consist of a mass of jelly, with two layers of cells, and they are classified as a separate phylum from cnidarians. \nThe answer: a phylum of marine animals that use groups of cilia called \"combs\" for swimming", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the feature used for swimming, which implies a comparison with other animals that swim differently. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a physical feature, which is different from the animal's classification or habitat. \nThe answer: groups of cilia", "{3, 4, 5, 8}\nExplanation: Ctenophora and cnidarians were once classified in the same phylum, Coelenterata, because they both rely on water flow through the body cavity for digestion and respiration. However, more recent authors classify them as separate phyla. \nThe answer: water flow through the body cavity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from shape, age, and color. If A is more large than B, then B is more small than A.\nThe answer: up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if ctenophora have a distinctive feature, then other animals do not have it. \nThe answer: \"Their most distinctive feature is the \u2018combs\u2019 \u2013 groups of cilia which they use for swimming \u2013 they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia.\"", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that ctenophora are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"ctenophora\" and \"comb jellies\" are interchangeable. \nThe answer: comb jellies", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from other characteristics, so rule 3 applies. The article states that \"Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size,\" which directly answers the question.\nThe answer: from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size.", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Ctenophora rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration. \nThe answer: water flow through the body cavity", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"comb carry\"", "{3, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The rules state that animals and locations are different concepts, and that names are equally important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: \"in marine waters worldwide.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day is not related to their size or shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day, it means that they can eat more than their own weight in a day.\nThe answer: ten times their own weight", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the number of validated species is the relevant information. \nThe answer: 100-150", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: possibly 25", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Only 100\u2013150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named.\" This means that the number of validated species is between 100 and 150, and there may be an additional 25 that have not been fully described and named. The use of \"only\" in the passage indicates that this number is relatively small compared to the total number of ctenophore species that exist.\nThe answer: 100-150 species have been validated.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: tentilla", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The passage states that in favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day.\nThe answer: ten times their own weight", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: tentacles", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Coastal beriods lack tentacles and use groups of large, stiffened cilia as teeth to prey on other ctenophores.\nThe answer: large, stiffened cilia", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Ctenophores can eat \"ten times their own weight in a day\", meaning they are highly efficient predators. This is a direct answer to the question.\nThe answer: ten times their own weight", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: tentilla", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage describes the coastal beroids as lacking tentacles and using \"groups of large, stiffened cilia\" as teeth to prey on other ctenophores.\nThe answer: large, stiffened cilia", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: colloblasts", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if it is stated that only 100-150 species have been validated, then the answer is that there are 100-150 different species of ctenophore. \nThe answer: 100-150 species have been validated.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that most species of Ctenophores are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female reproductive organs. Rule 3 states that gender is a different concept from the ability to produce both eggs and sperm. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the gender, and hermaphroditism is not a gender. \nThe answer: There is no gender, as most species are hermaphrodites.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we cannot assume that if an adult ctenophore has a certain shape, the young will have the same shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that adult ctenophores have a certain shape, we can infer that the young will not have that shape.

This is due to rule 2, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X, and rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts.\nThe answer: They can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Sequential hermaphrodites have eggs and sperm that mature at different times.\nThe answer: eggs and sperm mature at different times", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes that most species have external fertilization, but platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can infer that the group that keeps the eggs fertilized inside the parent's body until they hatch is the platyctenids.\nThe answer: platyctenids", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Hermaphroditism and reproduction are discussed, but not relevant to the answer. The relevant information is that the beroids have young that are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles.\nThe answer: Beroids.", "{3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions the accidental introduction of Mnemiopsis into the Black Sea, so the answer is the Black Sea.\nThe answer: the Black Sea", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea.\" The use of \"one\" indicates that there is a specific type of ctenophore that was introduced, and the word \"accidentally\" implies that it was not intentional. The question asks for the \"specific type\" of ctenophore, so we can use rule 13 to determine that names are important for the answer. We can also use rule 17 to note that negations are important, as the question asks for a specific type and not for any ctenophore that was introduced. \nThe answer: Mnemiopsis", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: long-term environmental changes", "{3, 5, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Beroe preys on other ctenophores does not imply that it eats a specific size, shape, age, or color. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the fact that Beroe preys on other ctenophores does not imply that it eats a vehicle or any other non-animal entity. If A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Beroe preys on other ctenophores, then the ctenophores it preys on are not its predators. Negations are important for the answer, so the fact that Beroe preys on other ctenophores implies that it does not eat fish larvae or organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. \nThe answer: other ctenophores", "{rule list: 3, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses the accidental introduction of Mnemiopsis into the Black Sea, which is a type of ctenophore.\nThe answer: Mnemiopsis", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We can infer from the passage that Mnemiopsis eats fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. Therefore, the answer is: fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that ctenophores may be abundant in some coastal locations during the summer months. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that ctenophores may be difficult to find in some places does not contradict the fact that they can be abundant in others. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if ctenophores are uncommon in some places, it follows that they are more common in others. \nThe answer: in some coastal locations during the summer months", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that ctenophores may be abundant in some coastal locations during the summer months. This implies that they can be found in large amounts in certain bays or coastal areas. The use of \"may be\" also suggests that this is not always the case and that ctenophores can be uncommon and difficult to find in other places. \nThe answer: in some coastal locations/bays", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Phytoplankton are planktonic plants that are a vital part of marine food chains.\nThe answer: Planktonic plants", "{3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is a specific ctenophore that was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the appearance of the ctenophore. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the specific ctenophore mentioned in the article. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the ctenophore is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse. \nThe answer: Mnemiopsis.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for an event that was blamed on the introduction of mnemiopsis into The Black Sea. The passage states that the introduction of Mnemiopsis into the Black Sea is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. Therefore, the answer is: collapse of fish stocks. \nThe relevant rules are:\n- Rule 3: color, shape, age, and size are different concepts, so \"event\" is not interchangeable with any of these concepts.\n- Rule 7: questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"blamed\" is synonymous with \"attributed to\".\n- Rule 17: negations are important for the answer, so the answer is not \"increase of fish stocks\" but rather the opposite, \"collapse of fish stocks\".", "{3, 5, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Size and shape are different concepts, so the fact that Mnemiopsis was overpopulating the Black Sea is irrelevant to the answer. The relevant information is that Beroe was accidentally introduced to help mitigate the problem. Since Beroe preys on other ctenophores, it was used to control the population of Mnemiopsis. \nThe answer: Beroe was introduced to prey on other ctenophores.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the date of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can focus on identifying the specific time period mentioned in the article. Rule 8 tells us that if we know when an event happened, we can use the antonym of the characteristic to determine when it did not happen. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. The article states that the modern groups of ctenophores appeared after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which means that the event happened before the appearance of these groups. Therefore, the answer is before the appearance of modern ctenophore groups, probably around 66 million years ago. \n\nThe answer: around 66 million years ago.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer.

This means that the fossils are at least 515 million years old.\nThe answer: 515 million years ago", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the \"Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event\" which is the event that happened 66 million years ago. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that age is a different concept from other characteristics mentioned in the passage. Rule 10 is relevant because it states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so \"cydippids\" cannot be a concept related to size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if \"cydippids\" are not a certain concept, then they are the opposite of that concept. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer must include the negation \"not.\" \nThe answer: monophyletic", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any differences in these aspects between current ctenophores and their fossilized counterparts are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the fossils had \"many more comb-rows than modern forms,\" then the answer is that current ctenophores have fewer comb-rows than the fossils found. \nThe answer: tentacles", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that jellyfish and sea anemones belong to the phylum cnidarians. This is a different concept from sponges and ctenophores, which are also mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: cnidarians", "{3}\nExplanation: Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey.\nThe answer: Colloblasts", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: Ctenophora are compared in complexity to sponges, cnidarians, and bilaterians, and are stated to be less complex than bilaterians. Therefore, the answer is bilaterians.\nThe answer: bilaterians", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 establishes a comparison between two entities, and in this case, sponges are being compared to ctenophores. Rule 3 establishes that complexity is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: Ctenophores", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey. This means that ctenophores use colloblasts to capture prey.\nThe answer: colloblasts", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that jellyfish and sea anemones belong to the cnidarians group. \nThe answer: cnidarians", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A, so the answer must be something that no other animal has. The answer: colloblasts.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if ctenophores use colloblasts to capture their prey, then other animals do not use colloblasts. Therefore, the answer is: colloblasts.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that both ctenophores and cnidarians have cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes, muscles, nervous systems, and some have sensory organs. Therefore, the two groups are ctenophores and cnidarians.\nThe answer: ctenophores and cnidarians", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that complexity is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. We use rule 8 to infer that if ctenophores are less complex than bilaterians, then bilaterians are more complex than ctenophores.\nThe answer: bilaterians", "{3}\nExplanation: The article states that ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores. \nThe answer: mesoglea", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question is asking for the classification of ctenophores and cnidarians, which is a concept related to their biological characteristics and not their size, shape, age, or color. Therefore, Rule 3 applies. The passage also mentions that there is some debate about whether ctenophores should be classified as diploblastic or triploblastic, with some recent textbooks classifying them as triploblastic. This implies that there is some disagreement or uncertainty about their classification, which is consistent with the application of Rule 8. \nThe answer: diploblastic (or possibly triploblastic, depending on the classification)", "3, 8\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the article mentions that ctenophores and cnidarians have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the mesoglea. Therefore, the answer is ctenophores and cnidarians.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. Therefore, the answer is sponges.\nThe answer: sponges", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the hairs on ctenophores. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about those characteristics is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any information about the ctenophores' behavior or habitat is also irrelevant. The answer is \"ctenes\". \nThe answer: ctenes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the size of ctenophores is not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if ctenophores use cilia as their main method of locomotion, then they do not use any other method more than cilia. Therefore, the answer is: cilia are used as their main method of locomotion.", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the comb-like bands of cilia are called \"ctenes\". \nThe answer: ctenes", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: \"ctenophora\" means \"comb-bearing\", from the Greek \u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 (stem-form \u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd-) meaning \"comb\" and the Greek suffix -\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 meaning \"carrying\".\nThe answer: comb-bearing", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.\" This means that Pleurobrachia is the cidippid used as a description on ctenophores in most textbooks.\nThe answer: Pleurobrachia", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study\" and that \"oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes.\" These statements indicate that oceanic species are the hardest to study. The rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that \"coastal\" and \"oceanic\" are different concepts. The rule 7 is relevant because it reminds us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Oceanic species", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles.\nThe answer: to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles.", "{3, 5, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera \u2013 Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis.\" This means that these three genera have been studied the most.\nThe answer: Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis.", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the inside lining of a ctenophore is a different concept than its size, shape, age, or color. We use rule 9 to infer that if the inside of a ctenophore is lined with a certain type of cells, then the opposite side of those cells is covered with ciliated cells. \nThe answer: The inside of a ctenophore is lined with an epithelium called the gastrodermis.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Neither of these rules are directly relevant to the question, so they are the most minimal set of rules that can be applied.\nThe answer: bioluminescence", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the internal cavity forms: a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx ('throat')\". \nThe answer: pharynx", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any information about those concepts from the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What does the internal cavity not contain?\" The answer is: It does not contain organs.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes the internal cavity of ctenophora and how it branches through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, the answer is: the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles, if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the outer surface of the organism has eight comb rows, which are also called swimming-plates. \nThe answer: swimming-plates", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so \"combs\" cannot refer to hair combs or chicken combs. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if \"combs\" were less specific than \"swimming-plates,\" the latter would be used instead. Therefore, \"combs\" refer to the rows of cilia on the swimming-plates of ctenophores.\nThe answer: swimming-plates", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. The 9 + 3 pattern of cilia is thought to have a supporting function. Therefore, the answer is: \"The 9 + 3 pattern of cilia is thought to have a supporting function.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that ctenophores swim in the direction in which their mouth is pointing, unlike jellyfish. This means that they swim in the direction of the oral pole. The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the direction of swimming is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the direction of swimming, which is the opposite of the direction of the power stroke of the comb plate cilia. Therefore, the answer is: Ctenophores swim in the direction of their mouth, which is the opposite of the direction of the power stroke of the comb plate cilia.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the cilia on the comb plates are \"unusually long\" and can grow up to \"2 millimeters (0.079 in).\" This means that the length of the cilia can be up to 2 millimeters.\nThe answer: 2 millimeters", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about how ctenophores control their buoyancy, which is a comparison between different densities. The answer is that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Specifically, their ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump water into or out of the mesoglea to increase or decrease its bulk and density, depending on the density of the surrounding water.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that ctenophores control their buoyancy by pumping water into or out of the mesoglea, which is the gelatinous layer between their outer and inner body walls. This is done by the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity. The question asks specifically what the water is pumped into, so we can use rule 3 to determine that the answer is the mesoglea. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks about pumping water into something, so we can use the antonym of \"into\" (which is \"out of\") to determine that the answer is the mesoglea. \nThe answer: the mesoglea", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that pumping water into the mesoglea increases its bulk and decreases its density, which helps ctenophores avoid sinking when they enter less dense brackish water. \nThe answer: increases its bulk and decreases its density", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The ciliary rosettes pump water into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density.\nThe answer: pump water into the mesoglea", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers that refer to those concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the aboral organ is the largest sensory feature, then any other sensory features mentioned in the article are smaller. Therefore, the answer is the aboral organ. \nThe answer: The aboral organ.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The aboral organ is located at the opposite end from the mouth.\nThe answer: at the opposite end from the mouth", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the statocyst, a balance sensor, is protected by a transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia.\nThe answer: a transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for the \"main component\" of the aboral organ, implying that there may be other components as well. Therefore, we can infer that the main component is more important than any other components. \nThe answer: statocyst", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\nThe answer: a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia, called \"balancers\", that sense its orientation.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: sea gooseberry", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that the answer to the question is not related to the shape or size of the Pleurobrachia's body. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the Cydippid ctenophores have tentacles, then the Pleurobrachia also has tentacles. \nThe answer: tentacles", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Shape is a relevant concept.\nThe answer: more or less rounded, sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg-shaped", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article describes that the tentacles of the pleurobrachia are \"housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn,\" indicating that they are protected. Additionally, the question uses the word \"protected,\" which is an antonym of \"exposed,\" so rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: a sheath", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: The rule that shape is a different concept from location (rule 3) is relevant here, as the question asks about the location of the mouth on the Pleurobrachia. The rule that names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) is also relevant, as the question specifically asks about the Pleurobrachia. Finally, the rule that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer (rule 12) is relevant, as the passage describes other aspects of the cydippid ctenophores before mentioning the location of the mouth on the Pleurobrachia. \nThe answer: At the narrow end of its egg-shaped body.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: Rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and Rule 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph) apply here. The passage states that the tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla. \"Fringed\" is a synonym for \"covered with,\" which means that the answer is tentilla.\nThe answer: tentilla", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis that capture prey by sticking to it. They have a domed head with vesicles that contain adhesive, a stalk that anchors the cell, and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. (Rule 3: size, shape, age, and color are different concepts; Rule 8: if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B) \nThe answer: specialized cells that capture prey by sticking to it", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the tentilla of Euplokamis contain striated muscle, which is otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora, and that they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. This makes them different from other cydippids. \nThe answer: They contain striated muscle and are coiled when relaxed.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the number of types of movements being related to a numerical value. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" helps to clarify that the answer is not \"two types of movements\" but rather \"three types of movements.\" \nThe answer: Three types of movements.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes how the tentilla of Euplokamis differ from those of other cydippids and how they use three types of movement to capture prey: flicking out quickly, wriggling to lure prey, and coiling around prey. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is important to distinguish the different types of movement used by Euplokamis. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so it is important to note that the other cydippids do not use these three types of movement. \nThe answer: to capture prey", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the number of rows of combs is a different concept from other information in the passage. We use rule 16 to determine that the number of rows is mentioned first in the passage. \nThe answer: eight", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article describes that there are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end, and are spaced evenly round the body. This indicates that the rows of combs are located around the body, from near the mouth to the opposite end.\nThe answer: around the body", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: evenly round the body", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage describes the physical structure of a comb jelly, including the rows of combs and the ciliary groove that connects them to the balancers in the statocyst. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as potential answers. The answer is the ciliary groove.\nThe answer: ciliary groove", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage describes the physical characteristics of the Lobata, including their \"pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth.\"\nThe answer: Lobata have a pair of lobes.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: \"auricles\" is a specific term mentioned in the passage, which refers to gelatinous projections on either side of the mouth of many species of lobates. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is important to understand that auricles are a specific shape of structure. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that lobates have auricles, we can infer that other organisms that do not have auricles are less like lobates. \nThe answer: gelatinous projections on either side of the mouth of many species of lobates", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"many species of lobates have four auricles\" between the lobes on either side of the mouth. \nThe answer: four", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage describes the auricles as gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. \nThe answer: produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that lobates feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.\nThe answer: suspended planktonic prey", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: clap their lobes to drive themselves backwards quickly", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: they can escape from danger quickly", "{rule list: 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia.\" This means that the movements of the lobates' combs are controlled by nerves.\nThe answer: nerves", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Shape is a different concept from control. The relevant rule is 23, which states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question is asking for the subject that controls the combs, which is an active construction. Therefore, the answer is not \"controlled by shape\" but rather \"not specified\" since the article does not provide information on who or what controls cydippids' combs. \n\nThe answer: not specified", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that the Beroida are also known as Nuda.\nThe answer: Nuda.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for a group that has no feeding appendages, so the answer cannot be a group that has \"small\" or \"reduced\" feeding appendages. The answer is \"Beroida/Nuda\".", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the question asks about a specific feature of some species of beroe, then the answer should describe what that feature does. The answer is: \"The pair of strips of adhesive cells on the stomach wall 'zip' the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding, by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip.\"", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the Beroe has a large pharynx with \"macrocilia\" that can \"bite\" off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole. Additionally, when the Beroe is pursuing prey, it \"streamlines\" the front of its body by zipping its mouth shut with narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells. \nThe answer: Streamlines the front of its body.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the Beroida has a specific size or shape instead of feeding appendages. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the Beroida has no feeding appendages, then it has \"macrocilia\" that can \"bite\" off pieces of prey. \nThe answer: \"macrocilia\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer should focus on the shape of the animals. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that there are two known species, we can infer that both species are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals. \nThe answer: Cestida", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Cestum veneris is \"among the largest ctenophores\" and that it can grow up to 1.5 meters long. This means that there may be other ctenophores that are larger, but Cestum veneris is the largest one mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: Cestum veneris", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Cestida are described as \"ribbon-shaped planktonic animals\" in the article, and the rules state that shape is a different concept from other characteristics. Therefore, the answer is \"ribbon-shaped planktonic animals\".\nThe answer: ribbon-shaped planktonic animals", "{3}\nExplanation: Cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows.\nThe answer: Cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows.", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The article describes two species of Cestida, Cestum veneris and Velamen parallelum. It states that Velamen parallelum can move much faster in a \"darting motion.\" Therefore, the answer is Velamen parallelum.\nThe answer: Velamen parallelum", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can't assume that \"oval\" and \"flattened\" are the same thing. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if most platyctenida have tentilla-bearing tentacles on their aboral surface, then the one species that doesn't have them must have them on their oral surface. \nThe answer: tentilla-bearing tentacles", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Platyctenida use their pharynx as a muscular \"foot\" to cling to and creep on surfaces.\nThe answer: as a muscular \"foot\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: comb-rows", "{rule list: 3, 6}\nExplanation: Platycenida live on rocks, algae, or the body surfaces of other invertebrates.\nThe answer: on rocks, algae, or the body surfaces of other invertebrates", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: Eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis.\nThe answer: Via pores in the epidermis.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Platycetenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the genus in which self-fertilization has been seen. Rule 3 tells us that we need to pay attention to the different concepts mentioned in the passage, such as species and genus. Rule 8 tells us that if self-fertilization has been seen in one genus but not in another, then we can use the antonym of \"self-fertile\" to describe the latter. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, we can conclude that self-fertilization has been seen in some species of the genus Mnemiopsis. \nThe answer: Mnemiopsis", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the location of the gonads is a different concept from their function as both male and female. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if the gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, then they are not located elsewhere. \nThe answer: in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Fertilization is external in most species.\" \nThe answer: external", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size and shape are different concepts, so the fact that juveniles lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths does not mean that adults also lack them. Therefore, we need to apply rule 3 to avoid assuming that the answer for juveniles applies to adults. Additionally, the question asks for a lack of something, so we need to apply rule 8 to find the antonym of \"lack\". \nThe answer: tentacles and tentacle sheaths", "{3, 6, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the location of juvenile platyctenids is not related to their size, shape, or color. Rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the location of juvenile platyctenids is not related to any type of vehicle. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the sentence. \nThe answer: among the plankton", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults\" and \"in most species the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents.\" This means that juveniles develop into adults gradually over time. \nThe answer: gradually over time", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and behavior are different concepts. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about behavior. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about a comparison between juvenile platyctenids and another group. \nThe answer: Juvenile platyctenids behave more like true larvae, living among the plankton and occupying a different ecological niche from their parents.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if a genus lacks tentacles and sheaths, it must be a genus that typically has them. Therefore, the answer is Beroe. \nThe answer: Beroe", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The three species mentioned in the article produce luminescent secretions when disturbed. \nThe answer: They produce luminescent secretions when disturbed.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that when these species are disturbed, they produce secretions (ink) that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies. This means that the secretions are produced when the species are disturbed. Rule 3 applies because \"when\" is a temporal concept, and rule 7 applies because \"excrete\" is a synonym for \"produce\". \nThe answer: when they are disturbed", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that when certain species are disturbed, they produce \"secretions (ink)\" that luminesce. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so \"secretions\" and \"ink\" are not considered synonyms. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"secretions\" can be considered a synonym for \"ink.\" \nThe answer: ink", "{2, 3}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because it states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, the article states that juveniles luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults, so juveniles are the most bright and adults are the least bright. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and in this case, the question is asking about brightness, which is related to age. \nThe answer: Juveniles", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that \"Almost all ctenophores are predators.\" Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the concept of diet, which is different from the concepts of size, shape, age, and color.\nThe answer: predators", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Haeckelia preys on jellyfish is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Haeckelia preys on jellyfish and not ctenophores like most other species in its phylum, then it can be inferred that it is less of a predator of ctenophores than other species. Therefore, the answer is jellyfish. \nThe answer: jellyfish", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. This means that the nematocysts are incorporated into Haeckelia's own tentacles.\nThe answer: They are incorporated into Haeckelia's tentacles.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Bolinopsis feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Pleurobrachia mainly captures relatively strong swimmers, then Bolinopsis generally feeds on weaker swimmers. \nThe answer: smaller, weaker swimmers", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lampea", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Ctenophores were thought to have a low ratio of organic matter to salt and water, making them a poor diet for other animals.\nThe answer: low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "{rule list: 4, 10}\nExplanation: The question asks for a synonym for \"oncorhynchus.\" Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: There is no synonym given for oncorhynchus in the article.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores.\nThe answer: other ctenophores", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: during blooms in the Red Sea.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The article mentions that turtles and jellyfish can eat large quantities of ctenophores.\nThe answer: ctenophores", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between size, shape, age, and color as different concepts from the concept of what is causing the drop in fish catches. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and in this case, the ctenophore is more responsible for the drop in fish catches than any other factor. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the question is asking for what is causing the drop in fish catches, not what is increasing fish catches. \nThe answer: Mnemiopsis leidyi", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: accidentally introduced via the ballast tanks of ships", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the population of Mnemiopsis in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov was brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. Additionally, rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: The population of Mnemiopsis in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov was brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993.", "{rule list: 3, 7, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it is stated that \"in the late 1980s\" the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships. The question asks for the specific time of the introduction, which is \"late 1980s\".\nThe answer: late 1980s", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. This means that cooling has a negative effect on the Mnemiopsis.\nThe answer: It slows its metabolism.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: Ctenophores are rare as fossils because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, which are not easily preserved. Fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerst\u00e4tten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue.\nThe answer: Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies.", "{3, 6, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the fact that Eoandromeda is an Ediacaran organism is irrelevant to the answer. Names are equally important for the answer, so the answer is: a comb jelly.", "{rule list: 3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a period, which is a different concept from the other information in the article. Typos are irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: mid-Cambrian period", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age.\" This means that three species were found in the Burgess Shale.\nThe answer: 3", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: tentacles", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the fossil Stromatoveris was dated to about 515 million years ago and was found in China's Chengjiang lagerst\u00e4tte.\nThe answer: about 515 million years ago", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the discovery of a fossil called Stromatoveris in China's Chengjiang lagerst\u00e4tte, which is similar to Vendobionta from the preceding Ediacaran period. The fossil is dated to about 515 million years ago. \nThe answer: sessile frond-like fossils", "{3, 8, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses the similarities between the early Cambrian fossil Stromatoveris and Vendobionta, and suggests that Stromatoveris is an evolutionary \"aunt\" of ctenophores. Therefore, the answer is Stromatoveris. \nThe answer: Stromatoveris", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Vendobionta", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Vendobionta lived during the preceding Ediacaran period, which is mentioned as the period before the early Cambrian period in the article. Therefore, rule 3 (age is a different concept from other concepts) and rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B) are relevant. \nThe answer: Ediacaran period", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa. Rule 3 tells us that concepts like size, shape, age, and color are different and not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Here, the article mentions several possible relationships of ctenophores to other animal phyla, but we need to identify the one that recent studies believe in. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. The answer is: all other animal phyla.", "{3, 5, 16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is asking for the earliest-diverging animal phylum, which is a matter of evolutionary history. Rule 3 states that concepts such as shape and color are different from concepts such as age and evolutionary history, so we can eliminate any information about the physical characteristics of the animals. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so we can eliminate any information about vehicles. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can focus on the information about the earliest-diverging animal phylum. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negations in the passage. Finally, Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to pay attention to the structure of the sentences. \nThe answer: Porifera (sponges)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other characteristics, and rule 8 states that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A and A has less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, so the answer is beroids. \nThe answer: beroids", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as size, shape, age, and color, should not be confused. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for what cydippids are not, so we can use the antonym of the adjective \"monophyletic\" which is \"polyphyletic\". Therefore, the answer is \"monophyletic\". \nThe answer: monophyletic", "{rule list: 3, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific event, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction. Rule 3 reminds us that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can focus on the sentence that mentions the extinction event. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can ignore the typo in \"Cretaceous-Paleogen\". Rule 12 tells us that irrelevant passages can be ignored, so we can skip the parts of the article that do not mention the extinction event. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to pay attention to the wording of the question. \nThe answer: 65.5 million years ago", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who conducted a morphological analysis in 1985 and what the conclusion of that analysis was. Rule 1 and 2 are relevant because they help to clarify the meaning of the terms \"monophyletic\" and \"cydippids.\" Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of names in answering the question.\nThe answer: Richard Harbison", "{1, 16, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if a city is the fifth-largest in California, then there are four cities larger than it. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the answer should be the name of a city. Rule 13 is relevant because it establishes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Fresno", "{3, 10, 16}\nExplanation: We need to find the distance between two cities, which is a matter of geography and location. Therefore, we apply rules 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), 10 (typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). \nThe answer: Approximately 220 miles (350 km) northwest of Los Angeles.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession. Therefore, the fact that Fresno is a city in California is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to focus on the meaning of the name Fresno. \nThe answer: \"ash tree\"", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"an ash leaf is featured on the city's flag.\" This is a description of a symbol on the flag, which falls under the concept of \"color\" and is therefore covered by rule 3. The answer is \"an ash leaf.\" \nThe answer: an ash leaf", "{rule list: 10, 11}\nExplanation: The pronunciation of a word is not affected by its context or any other rules, so only rules 10 and 11, which state that typos and contractions are irrelevant, are relevant for this question.\nThe answer: FREZ-noh", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1872", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: convenience of the railroad and worry about flooding", "{16, 13}\nExplanation: The passage directly states that \"Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885.\" \nThe answer: 1885", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 47", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Central Pacific Railroad", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and nationality. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for the percentage of the population that was Asian, which is a color/nationality concept. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that size, shape, and age are not relevant to the answer. Then, we can use rule 8 to determine that the answer is the antonym of \"not Asian,\" which is 97.3%. \nThe answer: 2.7%", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Chinatown (incongruously)", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Pinedale, which is now in North Fresno, was the site of an assembly center for Japanese Americans during World War II. This implies that North Fresno was called Pinedale before 1942.\nThe answer: Pinedale", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes Pinedale as an \"interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area Japanese Americans to internment camps,\" indicating that it was a center for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The use of the word \"relocation\" is a euphemism for the forced removal and imprisonment of Japanese Americans, and the mention of the Fresno Fairgrounds being used as an assembly center further supports this. \nThe answer: an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area Japanese Americans to internment camps", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Fresno Fairgrounds was utilized as an assembly center for the relocation of Japanese Americans to internment camps during World War II. This information directly answers the question.\nThe answer: an assembly center for the relocation of Japanese Americans to internment camps.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a new product introduced by Bank of America in 1958. Rule 3 reminds us that we should focus on concepts, not properties like size or color. Rule 12 tells us that irrelevant information can be ignored. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we should note that the product was not a failure. \nThe answer: BankAmericard", "{1, 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the first successful credit card, which is BankAmericard as stated in the article. Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that \"first successful\" means that there were earlier financial products that could do one or the other but not both. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of name and success. Rule 7 is relevant because it acknowledges that synonyms may be used in the question. Rule 13 is relevant because it states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: BankAmericard", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The BankAmericard was the first financial instrument that allowed cardholders to revolve a balance and was usable across a large number of merchants, which previous financial products could not do.\nThe answer: Revolve a balance and be usable across a large number of merchants.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1976", "{3, 4, 15}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and if a person had profession X but changed to profession Y, then they have profession Y. Therefore, the fact that BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company means that it turned into a different company altogether. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is also relevant here, as it helps to clarify that BankAmericard was renamed before being spun off. \nThe answer: Visa Inc.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that the song \"Walking Into Fresno\" was written by Bill Aken. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, but since there are no last names mentioned in the article, only the first name \"Bill\" is necessary for the answer.\nThe answer: Bill", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and \"recorded\" implies a musical recording, which is a profession (rule 16).\nThe answer: Bob Gallion", "{3, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about Bill Aken's background and where he grew up. \nThe answer: Madera.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Fresno Barn (old country-western show)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lupe Mayorga", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Fresno has \"three large public parks.\" \nThe answer: 3", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists three parks in Fresno: Woodward Park, Roeding Park, and Kearney Park. It states that Roeding Park is home to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo and Rotary Storyland and Playland. Therefore, the answer is Roeding Park.\nThe answer: Roeding Park", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Kearney Park is home to historic Kearney Mansion.\nThe answer: Kearney Park", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists three public parks in Fresno, and describes Woodward Park as being in North Fresno and adjacent to the San Joaquin River Parkway. \nThe answer: Shinzen Japanese Gardens", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: We can ignore the information about the other parks and focus on Kearney Park, which is mentioned as the location of the annual Civil War Revisited. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant here, but the rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is relevant in distinguishing between the different parks. \nThe answer: Kearney Park", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Between the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished.\" This indicates that downtown Fresno thrived during the period between the 1880s and World War II.\nThe answer: Between the 1880s and World War II", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. These rules are relevant because they help us identify the two buildings that are now demolished. \nThe answer: the original Fresno County Courthouse and the Fresno Carnegie Public Library.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: San Joaquin Light & Power Building", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article lists several architectural buildings in Downtown Fresno, including the Hughes Hotel, which is mentioned as having burned down.\nThe answer: Hughes Hotel", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Fulton Street in Downtown Fresno was converted into one of the nation's first pedestrian malls in 1964.\nThe answer: 1964", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Fulton Street was converted into a pedestrian mall and renamed the Fulton Mall.\nThe answer: Fulton Mall.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Pierre-Auguste Renoir", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations. \nThe answer: Near their current locations.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Fulton Mall will be reopened to automobile traffic, but also states that the area will feature wide sidewalks (up to 28' on the east side of the street) to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district. This indicates that the restoration will include wide sidewalks to enhance the pedestrian friendly environment.\nThe answer: wide sidewalks", "{3, 12, 14}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are that locations are important for the answer and that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. The answer is: on Fresno's far southeast side.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: We only need to focus on the sentence that describes the neighborhood of Sunnyside and identify the two major thoroughfares mentioned. \nThe answer: Kings Canyon Avenue and Clovis Avenue.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Sunnyside was largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s.\nThe answer: in the 1950s through the 1970s", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The location of the Sunnyside Country Club is mentioned in the last sentence of the passage. Rule 14 states that locations are equally important for the answer. Rule 3 states that location is a different concept from other concepts such as size, shape, age, and color.\nThe answer: Sunnyside", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the designer of the golf course at the Sunnyside Country Club, which is a specific location mentioned in the article. Therefore, we need to use rule 13 to consider names as important for the answer. Additionally, we need to use rule 16 to determine that the designer's name should come after the name of the location. \nThe answer: William P. Bell", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Tower District neighborhood being centered around the historic Tower Theatre, which was built in 1939 and is included on the National List of Historic Places. Therefore, the answer is: Tower Theatre.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The theater was built in 1939,\" which directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 1939", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The Tower Theatre gets its name from a well-known landmark water tower within Fresno.\nThe answer: a water tower", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that California State University at Fresno was originally called Fresno Normal School. This information is given in the last sentence of the passage, which comes after the mention of the Tower District neighborhood and its proximity to the college. Therefore, rules 13 and 16 are relevant, as they state that names and the order of information are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Fresno Normal School", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Tower District is one-half mile south of Fresno City College.\nThe answer: one-half mile", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The Tower Theatre re-opened in the late 1970s.\nThe answer: late 1970s", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"age\" is a different concept from \"type of movies\" and the rule that \"more/less\" relationships have antonyms. \nThe answer: second and third run movies, along with classic films.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater & Good Company Players opened nearby in 1978. \nThe answer: 1978", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the birthplace of Audra McDonald, a person mentioned in the article. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for information about McDonald in the article. Rule 20 states that \"she\" refers to female names, so we know that McDonald is a woman. The article states that McDonald is a \"Fresno native,\" so the answer is Fresno. \nThe answer: Fresno", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Evita and The Wiz", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"live theater\" in the list of features in the neighborhood. The question asks for the type of theater, which is not specified in the passage, so we can assume that \"live theater\" is the most specific answer we can provide based on the given information.\nThe answer: live theater", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the restaurants, live theater, nightclubs, shops, and bookstores are \"all within a few hundred feet of each other.\" \nThe answer: Within a few hundred feet of each other.", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the mention of restaurants, live theater, and nightclubs in the neighborhood indicates that the area is attractive for businesses. The irrelevant information about the LGBT and punk/goth/deathrock and heavy metal communities is disregarded. Negations are important for the answer, so the question \"What area has become attractive for restaurants?\" implies that the area was not previously attractive for restaurants. \nThe answer: The Tower District", "{3, 4, 7, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be confused. The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so they cannot be confused. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we need to pay attention to the meaning of the words. The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the district. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we need to identify the correct pronoun. \nThe answer: Tower District", "{rule list: 4, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Tower District is known as the center of Fresno's LGBT and hipster communities, as well as the local punk/goth/deathrock and heavy metal community. Therefore, we can use rule 4 to determine that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 12 to ignore the irrelevant information about restaurants, live theater, and nightclubs. We can also use rule 13 to determine that names and locations are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Tower District", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage describes the different styles of architecture found in Fresno, including California Bungalow, American Craftsman, Spanish Colonial Revival, Mediterranean Revival, Mission Revival, and Storybook houses. The passage does not mention any specific type of home that Fresno is known for. \nThe answer: The passage does not provide a specific answer.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Therefore, the types of houses designed by Fresno architects are not related to their profession or nationality, but rather to their style and architecture. \nThe answer: Storybook houses", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Tower District's residential architecture contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes and urban sprawl in north and east areas of Fresno.\nThe answer: contrasts", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that many of the early twentieth century homes in Fresno have been restored in recent decades. This means that the restoration happened some time ago, but not too long ago. We can use rule 3 to understand that \"recent\" means \"not too long ago\" and rule 12 to ignore any irrelevant information.\nThe answer: in recent decades", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Huntington Boulevard", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Alta Vista Tract was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation. \nThe answer: William Stranahan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1914", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes.\" This means that five years after Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, it had 267 homes.\nThe answer: 267 homes", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the company that provided streetcar connections between downtown and the hospital, which is a specific detail mentioned in the passage. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the company is not a person or a nationality is irrelevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"hospital\" can be considered a synonym for \"County Hospital\" mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: Fresno Traction Company", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage provides two names for the neighborhood: \"West Side\" and \"Southwest Fresno\". Rule 3 states that synonyms are important for the answer, and rule 12 states that irrelevant passages should be ignored. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: Southwest Fresno", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the west side of Fresno neighborhood lies southwest of the 99 freeway, which means it is located in the direction that is both west and south of the freeway.\nThe answer: southwest", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that color, age, shape, and size are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that the neighborhood is the center of Fresno's African-American community is the relevant information.\nThe answer: African-American community.", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: The rule that \"ethnicity and nationality are different concepts\" does not apply here as the question is specifically asking about Asian-American groups. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" also does not apply as no specific names are mentioned in the passage. The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" is also not relevant as the question is not asking for a specific location. The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 12 (irrelevant passages). The answer is Hmong or Laotian.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides a clear description of the location of the \"West Side\" neighborhood, stating that it lies southwest of the 99 freeway and west of the 41 freeway. Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that the neighborhood west of the 41 freeway is the \"West Side\" neighborhood.\nThe answer: \"West Side\" neighborhood", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Kearney Boulevard is a neighborhood in Fresno that extends from Fresno Street in Southwest Fresno about 20 mi (32 km) west to Kerman, California. It is named after M. Theo Kearney, an early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire. \nThe answer: M. Theo Kearney", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kearney Boulevard is lined with tall palm trees.\nThe answer: palm trees", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The roughly half-mile stretch of Kearney Boulevard between Fresno Street and Thorne Ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for Fresno's elite African-American families.\" This means that the wealthy African-Americans were residing between Fresno Street and Thorne Ave.\nThe answer: Fresno Street and Thorne Ave", "{rule list: 3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The rule about names (13) is relevant because the answer involves a specific name. The rule about irrelevant passages (3) is relevant because the answer is not in the first sentence.

This means that the public housing developments were built after the 1930s, but the exact year is not specified. Therefore, rules 3 (age) and 16 (order) are relevant. \nThe answer: between the 1960s and 1990s", "{rule list: locations are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The passage states that the shopping center is located on the corner of Fresno and B streets.\nThe answer: Fresno and B streets", "{3, 5, 12, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore them. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, but processing facilities are not either of them, so we can ignore rule 5. We can also ignore rule 12 since there is no irrelevant passage in the context. Therefore, we only need to use rules 3 and 13, which state that different concepts are different and names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Cargill Meat Solutions and Foster Farms.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Fresno Chandler Executive Airport is on the West Side. \nThe answer: on the West Side", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the neighborhood has \"very little retail activity\" and only mentions a modern shopping center on the corner of Fresno and B streets, small corner markets scattered throughout, and the Kearney Palm Shopping Center.

The passage states that there were 8,525 Native American residents in Fresno in 2010.\nThe answer: 8,525", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that age, shape, size, and color are different concepts is irrelevant. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is also irrelevant. The relevant rule is that percentages are different concepts. \nThe answer: 30.0%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the population density of Fresno in 2010 was 4,404.5 people per square mile. Rule 3 applies because population density is a measure of size, while race and ethnicity are different concepts. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a numerical value, and the passage provides a comparison between the population density in 2010 and the population percentage in 1970. \nThe answer: 4,404.5", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from size, shape, color, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles eliminates any confusion about the age of the households. The rule that \"if A has X, then A has at least X\" applies here, so we can simply take the number of households with children under 18, which is 68,511.\nThe answer: 68,511", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that age, shape, size, and color are different concepts, and the rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the relevant information is that 19.3% of households had a female householder with no husband present, which means that 80.7% of households did not have a female householder with no husband present. Therefore, the answer is 80.7%.", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, so the number of same-sex married couples/partnerships is not related to the household size or composition. Rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the number of same-sex married couples/partnerships is not related to the number of children or gender of the household head. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so the number of same-sex married couples/partnerships (which is listed last) is 1,388.\nThe answer: 1,388", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 16 states that the average family size is a numerical value. Therefore, the answer is: 3.62.", "{rule list: size is a different concept}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the number and types of households in a certain area, including the number of individuals and families living in them. The average household size is explicitly stated as 3.07.\nThe answer: 3.07", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant information is the population of Fresno in the year 2000, which is given in the article as 427,652 people.\nThe answer: 427,652", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that there were 149,025 housing units in the city in 2000.\nThe answer: 149,025", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that color is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can ignore the other racial categories mentioned in the passage. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the percentage of non-Black or African American residents is 91.6%. Therefore, the answer is 8.4%. \nThe answer: 8.4%", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule about different concepts (3) applies because \"Asian\" and \"Hmong\" are different concepts. The rule about antonyms (8) applies because the question asks for a specific portion of the Asian population, so the answer should be the opposite portion of the non-Hmong Asian population.\nThe answer: about two-thirds (or 66.6%)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the population density, which is given in the article as 4,097.9 people per square mile. This satisfies rule 3, which states that size and shape are different concepts, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the population density is more \"people per square mile\" in 2000 than any other year, and therefore the area is less \"square miles per person\" in 2000 than any other year. \nThe answer: 4,097.9 people per square mile", "{3}\nExplanation: The Federal Communications Commission decided that Fresno would only have UHF television stations to avoid interference with existing VHF television stations in the San Francisco Bay Area and those planned for Chico, Sacramento, Salinas, and Stockton.\nThe answer: to avoid interference with existing VHF television stations in the area", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The article states that KMJ-TV was the very first Fresno television station to begin broadcasting, so the answer is KMJ-TV.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: June 1, 1953", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The article states that KMJ is now known as NBC affiliate KSEE, indicating that the station changed its name. This fits with rule 15, which states that if A had profession X but changed to profession Y, then A has profession Y. Rule 3 is also relevant as it reminds us that name changes are different from changes in profession, shape, size, age, or color.\nThe answer: KSEE", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that CBS is a network and not a person is irrelevant. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that CBS is the third station listed after KFSN and KSEE. \nThe answer: KGPE", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" applies because the question is asking about a specific location, Fresno. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" does not apply. \nThe answer: State Route 99", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: State Route 168 is referred to as the Sierra Freeway in the article, which is a synonym for the road name.\nThe answer: Sierra Freeway", "{rule list: 7, 10}\nExplanation: The question asks for a synonym for \"Yosemite Freeway.\" Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, and rule 10 states that typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Eisenhower Freeway", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: State Route 180 comes from the west via Mendota.\nThe answer: west", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes the relationship between being directly linked to an interstate highway and being the largest city. Rule 3 is relevant because size and transportation infrastructure are different concepts. Rule 4 is relevant because profession and location are different concepts. Rule 8 is relevant because it establishes the relationship between being directly linked to an interstate highway and not being the largest city. Rule 17 is relevant because negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Fresno", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year, which is a numerical value that can be found through a simple fact-checking process. Rules 16 and 23 are relevant because they establish the importance of chronological order and the ability to identify active and passive sentences, respectively.\nThe answer: 1950s", "{3, 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that a state route is being discussed to upgrade to interstate standards. This means that it is not currently an interstate highway. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is State Route 99. \nThe answer: State Route 99", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, 22}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the desire to upgrade SR 99 to interstate standards due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along the route, as well as the desirability of Federal funding. The passage also mentions that major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, vertical clearance, and other concerns are currently underway.\nThe answer: rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along the route, desirability of Federal funding", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Amtrak San Joaquins provides passenger rail service in Fresno. This information is relevant to the question. Additionally, the article mentions other railroads and their operations in Fresno, but these are not relevant to the question.\nThe answer: Amtrak San Joaquins", "{rule list: locations are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of the Santa Fe Railroad Depot, which is mentioned in the article as the main passenger rail station in Downtown Fresno.\nThe answer: Downtown Fresno", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of an animal being one of the two railroads with railyards in Fresno. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer is: Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and Union Pacific Railroad.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that the San Joaquin Valley Railroad operates former Southern Pacific branchlines heading west and south out of the city. Therefore, if you were to take a train west or south out of the city of Fresno, you would take the San Joaquin Valley Railroad. \nThe answer: San Joaquin Valley Railroad", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Fresno", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the concept of Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: provided a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages", "{3}\nExplanation: The concept of Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching contradicted the established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth.\nThe answer: the established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4), questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph (rule 7), and names are equally important for the answer (rule 13). \nThe answer: Coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The goal of the system was to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages.\nThe answer: to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages.", "{rule list: 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) is credited with coining the modern name packet switching. This information is directly stated in the passage and does not require any inference or interpretation.\nThe answer: Donald Davies", "3, 4\nExplanation: The question is asking for a contrast between packet switching and another networking paradigm. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so these are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so this is also not relevant. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3 and 4. \nThe answer: Circuit switching.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Circuit switching is a method that pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes. It is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred. \nThe answer: a fee per unit of connection time", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Packet switching is characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Packet switching contrasts with circuit switching.\nThe answer: circuit switching", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Circuit switching pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes.\nThe answer: pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time, even when no data is transferred.\nThe answer: characterized by a fee per unit of connection time", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the characterization of packet switching. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so these are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can use this to rephrase the question as \"What is the antonym of how circuit switching is characterized?\" The answer is \"fee per unit of connection time,\" so the antonym is \"fee per unit of information transmitted.\" \nThe answer: characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted", "{3, 6, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, but the passage does not mention either of them, so rule 6 is not relevant. The relevant rule is 23, which states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question asks for how packet mode communication is implemented, which is an active construction. Therefore, the answer is: \"Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket.\"", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and do not apply to the question. Rule 9 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks how packets are normally forwarded, so the answer is that they are normally forwarded asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme in cases of shared physical medium.\nThe answer: according to a multiple access scheme", "{3, 6, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so rule 6 is relevant. Negations are important for the answer, so rule 17 is relevant. The answer: with or without intermediate forwarding nodes.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering. Therefore, it can be inferred that packets are not normally forwarded synchronously. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the question does not ask about any of these concepts. \nThe answer: by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The question asks about how packets are delivered in cases with shared medium, which is a concept related to the transmission of data. Therefore, the answer should focus on the concept of transmission and not on size, shape, age, or color. The answer is: according to a multiple access scheme.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for something that was developed for the Air Force. The passage mentions that Baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his research at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force into survivable communications networks. This fits the criteria of something that was developed for the Air Force.\nThe answer: distributed adaptive message block switching", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks (later called packets), and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.\nThe answer: decentralized network, message blocks/packets, store and forward switching", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks about how Air Force messages are delivered, which is answered in the last sentence of the passage: \"delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.\" The relevant rules are 3 (clarifying that \"delivery\" refers to the method of transmission), 9 (explaining that \"delivery\" is a synonym for \"message transfer\"), and 16 (clarifying that the answer is found at the end of the passage). \nThe answer: by store and forward switching.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the description of \"report P-2626\", which is a specific name mentioned in the article. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question.\nThe answer: a report that described a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network.", "{rule list: 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes the concept of \"store and forward switching\" for delivering messages.\nThe answer: store and forward switching", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a concept developed by Baran while researching at RAND. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we know that the concept must be mentioned in the article.

This methodology was called packet switching, which is a different concept from the ARPANET mentioned in the passage. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply to avoid confusion between different concepts. Additionally, rule 16 applies to determine that the use suggested for the system was for the ARPANET.\nThe answer: Use in the ARPANET", "{rule list: 1, 7, 8, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the person who developed the same technology as Baran. This involves comparing the work of different individuals, which requires applying rule 1 to understand that they developed the same methodology, rule 7 to recognize synonyms for \"technology,\" rule 8 to understand that the answer is the antonym of \"Baran's work,\" and rule 13 to prioritize names. \nThe answer: Donald Davies", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Davies called the system \"packet switching\"\nThe answer: packet switching", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for what was suggested at the Symposium in 1967. The passage states that a member of Davies' team suggested packet switching for use in the ARPANET at the 1967 ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles. This is a straightforward answer that requires no additional rules beyond Rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and Rule 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb). \nThe answer: packet switching", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: In connectionless mode, each packet includes complete addressing information, including a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. \nThe answer: complete addressing information, destination address, source address, port numbers, and possibly a sequence number.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about packet size and header size is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if connection-oriented systems require less work for connection set-up than connectionless systems, then connectionless systems require more work for packet routing. Therefore, the answer is: individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers, and may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This means that the information included with each packet label is the destination address, source address, port numbers, and possibly the sequence number. \nThe answer: destination address, source address, port numbers, and possibly sequence number.", "{rule list: 23}\nExplanation: The article explains that in connectionless mode, each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers, and may be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. The packets are routed individually, potentially resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order based on the packet sequence number.\nThe answer: The original message/data is reassembled in the correct order based on the packet sequence number.", "{rule 3, rule 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain certain information. This implies that the packet header is not long. Additionally, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"small\" is the antonym of \"long\", so the passage's statement that the packet header can be small implies that it is not long. \nThe answer: No, the packet header is small.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The node is required to look up the connection id in a table in order to route the packet. This is because connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication, and the packets include a connection identifier rather than address information. Therefore, the node needs to look up the connection id in a table to determine the route to the destination. \nThe answer: to determine the route to the destination.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that a connection identifier is not related to any of these concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that a connection identifier is a code that identifies a connection between endpoints, and it is not related to address information. \nThe answer: a code that identifies a connection between endpoints", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication. The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking. Therefore, the answer is that connection orientation requires a setup phase.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations, and they both require a protocol handshake between communicating parties.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for what supplanted Frame Relay and X.25, which are both connection-oriented protocols used for wide area networks.

The answer is the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and/or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. \nThe answer: IP, ATM, and/or versions of MPLS", "{rule list: 3, 4, 23}\nExplanation: X.25 and Frame Relay were both used for connection-oriented operations, but X.25 did it at the network layer of the OSI Model while Frame Relay did it at level two, the data link layer.\nThe answer: X.25 and Frame Relay were used for connection-oriented operations.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the evolution of networking protocols and their respective layers in the OSI Model. It mentions that X.25 and Frame Relay have been supplanted by IP at the network layer and ATM/MPLS at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS.\nThe answer: A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The first entity listed, ARPANET, became operational in 1969.\nThe answer: 1969", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: X.25 and ARPANET/SITA HLN differ in their network type (virtual call vs datagram), and in the division of responsibilities between hosts and the network core. \nThe answer: X.25 uses a virtual call system and has a simpler host interface, while ARPANET/SITA HLN use a datagram system where hosts are responsible for orderly delivery of packets.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The third rule states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. The eighth rule states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, since the question asks what the User Datagram Protocol guarantees, and the passage states that it is an example of a datagram protocol, we can infer that it guarantees orderly delivery of packets. \nThe answer: Orderly delivery of packets.", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: We can infer from the passage that X.25 uses the virtual call system network type, which guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host. \nThe answer: virtual call system", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8, 12, 13}\nExplanation: AppleTalk was a suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Inc. for Macintosh computers in 1985. It allowed for the establishment of local area networks without the need for a centralized router or server, and was a plug-n-play system.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the features of AppleTalk, which is a concept related to technology and networking protocols. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply, as they state that size, shape, age, color, profession, and nationality are different concepts. Additionally, rule 8 applies, as the question asks for the features of AppleTalk, which implies a comparison between different aspects of the protocol. \nThe answer: AppleTalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server. The AppleTalk system automatically assigned addresses, updated the distributed namespace, and configured any required inter-network routing. It was a plug-n-play system.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is that \"features\" and \"actions\" are different concepts, so we need to focus on the actions that the AppleTalk system performed. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is also relevant, as it helps us identify the specific action being referred to. The answer is: addresses.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: This question is asking for the name of a type of system that allows local area networks to be established without a centralized router or server. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse concepts, so we can eliminate any rules that relate to professions, nationalities, animals, or vehicles. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use this rule to determine that the type of system being described is decentralized. \nThe answer: Decentralized.", "{rule list: 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a network designed by a French person. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we should focus on the network itself and not the designer's nationality. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms, so \"designed\" can be replaced with \"created\" or \"developed\". Rule 13 reminds us that names are important for the answer, so we should look for the name of the network. \nThe answer: CYCLADES packet switching network.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the CYCLADES network was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself. This is a unique feature of the network and satisfies rule 3 (different concepts) and rule 8 (comparing more/less). \nThe answer: Making hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data.", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: The article explains that the CYCLADES network was the first to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the network itself, using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms. This was possible because the network used unreliable datagrams and end-to-end protocol mechanisms. \nThe answer: By using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The article discusses the CYCLADES packet switching network and its influence on later ARPANET architecture. The question asks for what later models were influenced by this network. The answer is \"later models of network architecture.\"", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation for peer-to-peer networking, initially released in 1975 to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol and was designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation, but later versions were open standards with published specifications and had several implementations developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.\nThe answer: a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: DECnet was originally created to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers.\nThe answer: connect two PDP-11 minicomputers.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify how many layers DECnet evolved into. Rule 3 tells us that size and number are different concepts, so we can't assume that the number of layers is related to the size of DECnet. Rule 16 tells us that if there is a sequence of events, we should order them chronologically. The passage tells us that DECnet initially had three layers, but later evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. Therefore, the answer is seven. \nThe answer: 7", "{rule list: 3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: DECnet Phase II evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol.\nThe answer: a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: Warner Sinback was a high-level marketing manager.\nThe answer: marketing manager", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because the article lists the four sales and service centers as Schenectady, Phoenix, Chicago, and Phoenix. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" is also relevant because the sentence structure in the article is passive. \nThe answer: sales and service centers for GE's computer business", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about the profitability of the computer sales and service centers. Rule 2 applies because \"profitable\" is the antonym of \"lost money\", so if the centers lost money, they were not profitable. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"were the centers profitable\"), which means that the answer should also be negated. \nThe answer: No, they lost money from the beginning.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: that a time-sharing system based on Kemney's work at Dartmouth could be profitable", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to explore computer networking between three of Michigan's public universities as a means to help the state's educational and economic development.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article describes the formation of a computer networking project between three of Michigan's public universities. The triad was completed with connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing. This is a chronological order question, so rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) applies. Additionally, the answer is found in a passive sentence, so rule 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb) applies.\nThe answer: connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing", "{3, 5, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes the development of computer networking between Michigan's public universities, which eventually led to the enhancement of the network to support various types of connections and the addition of more universities. This development set the stage for Merit's role in the NSFNET project. \nThe answer: the development of computer networking between Michigan's public universities", "{rule list: 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Telenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States, founded by Larry Roberts as a means of making ARPANET technology public. It was initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29. Telenet was a company that provided public data network services.\nThe answer: a company that provided public data network services", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the founder of Telenet, which is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine that the subject comes before the verb in an active sentence. The sentence \"Telenet was founded by former ARPA IPTO director Larry Roberts\" is in passive voice, so we need to use rule 23 to determine that the subject is acted upon the verb. The answer is Larry Roberts.\nThe answer: Larry Roberts", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Telnet was founded as a means of making ARPANET technology public and providing a public data network in the United States. \nThe answer: to provide a public data network in the United States.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the interface technology used by Telnet is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Telnet used X.25 and X.29 as its interface technology, then it did not use any other interface technology. \nThe answer: X.25 and X.29", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Telnet is not a person, location, animal, or vehicle, so rules 3, 5, 6, and 20 do not apply. The question asks about the sale of Telnet, which is a company, so rule 4 applies. The passage states that Telnet was sold to GTE, so rule 16 applies. \nThe answer: GTE", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Tymnet was an international data communications network that connected host computers at large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. It utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used various interfaces to connect users via dial-up or dedicated async connections. Tymnet consisted of a public network for dial-up users and a private network for government agencies and large companies to build their own dedicated networks. The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network. Tymnet was also connected to other public networks via X.25/X.75 gateways. The answer is Tymnet was an international data communications network.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\nExplanation: Tymnet connected host computers at large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies using virtual call packet switched technology and various interfaces. It also allowed government agencies and large companies to build their own dedicated networks and connected to other public networks via gateways. \nThe answer: host computers at large companies, educational institutions, and government agencies", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The article mentions that users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections, which fall under the category of how users connect in terms of technology and infrastructure.\nThe answer: Users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Tymnet's private network business allowed government agencies and large companies to build their own dedicated networks. This implies that Tymnet allowed private companies to build their own dedicated networks.\nThe answer: build their own dedicated networks", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that Tymnet's private network business allowed government agencies and large companies to build their own dedicated networks, which were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network. The use of \"allowed\" indicates a positive outcome, so we can eliminate rule 18. The question asks for the purpose of the gateways, so we can eliminate rules 4 and 5. The answer is not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles, so we can eliminate rules 3, 6, and 7. The answer does involve negation, so we need to consider rule 17. \nThe answer: Connect their own dedicated networks to the public network to reach locations not on the private network.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: X.25 networks were divided into two types: those with an X.25 external interface and those with an X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes. Therefore, there were two types of X.25 networks.\nThe answer: two", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research, which was a joint venture of Bell Canada and Northern Telecom. This indicates that a company, not an individual, developed DATAPAC. Additionally, the passage does not provide any information about specific individuals involved in the development of DATAPAC. \nThe answer: Bell Northern Research", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks about the purpose of foreign clones of DATAPAC. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the fact that the clones were foreign is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means that \"purpose\" can be replaced with \"allow for\". \nThe answer: interconnection of national X.25 networks", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: AUSTPAC was a public X.25 network operated by Telstra in Australia.\nThe answer: a public X.25 network", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: AUSTPAC supported on-line betting, financial applications, and remote terminal access to academic institutions.\nThe answer: on-line betting, financial applications, and remote terminal access to academic institutions.", "{rule list: 3, 10}\nExplanation: The question asks about how connections to AUSTPAC are made. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about these concepts is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. The answer: via a dial-up terminal to a PAD or by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: DATANET 1 was a public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom, which also included a public PAD service called Telepad and was used for the main Videotex service.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that Datanet 1 referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines, and the public PAD service Telepad. Therefore, strictly speaking, only the network and the connected users via leased lines were included in Datanet 1. Additionally, rule 8 applies because the question asks for who was included, and the passage specifies who was strictly included. \nThe answer: the network and the connected users via leased lines", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a person's nationality. The question asks for \"who else,\" indicating that there is already a known entity being referred to, which is the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom. Therefore, the answer must refer to another aspect of the network, which is the public PAD service Telepad. The passage states that \"the name also referred to the public PAD service Telepad,\" indicating that Datanet 1 also referred to this service. Finally, names are equally important for the answer, so the answer is \"the public PAD service Telepad.\"", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of KPN contributed to the confusion.\"\nThe answer: No, the use of the name was incorrect.", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: CSNET is a computer network funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation that began operation in 1981 to extend networking benefits for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET, due to funding or authorization limitations.

It built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that names are equally important for the answer is relevant because the question asks for a specific entity that Internet2 partnered with. The answer is Level 3 Communications. \nThe answer: Level 3 Communications", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998.\" The use of the word \"first\" indicates that there have been subsequent networks, and the question asks specifically for the name of the first one. The use of \"named\" indicates that the answer is a proper noun. Therefore, we can use rule 13 to determine that names are important for the answer, and rule 17 to determine that negations are important for the answer (since the question asks for the name of the network, not what it was not named). \nThe answer: Abilene", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Internet2 partnered with Qwest, Level 3 Communications, and the research and education communities, industry, and government. \nThe answer: Qwest and Level 3 Communications.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the context, it is mentioned that Abilene was the first Internet2 Network, which means that it was retired and replaced by a new network. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb.\" The sentence \"Internet2 officially retired Abilene\" is in the active voice, which means that Abilene was the subject and it was retired. Therefore, the answer is \"the Internet2 Network.\"", "{rule list: 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: NSFNET was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States.

Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if a disease is enzootic in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, it means that it is commonly present in those populations. \nThe answer: It means that the disease is commonly present in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"Nestorian graves dating to 1338-39 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague.\" This means that the graves are from the year 1338-39.\nThe answer: 1338-39", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the origin of all three waves of the plague. Rule 3 states that location is an important concept, so we need to pay attention to where the article mentions the origin of the plague. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article mentions that the plague originated in China, then we can infer that it did not originate elsewhere. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negations in the article. \nThe answer: China", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period related to the Chinese famine mentioned in the article. Rule 3 reminds us that age is a different concept from other factors, so we can ignore the other time periods mentioned in the article. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can ignore the fact that \"Chinese\" is missing an article. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to look for a positive statement about the beginning of the famine. \nThe answer: 1331", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: We can infer from the passage that an epidemic, which may have included plague, killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it reached Constantinople in 1347. Therefore, the answer is 25 million.\nThe answer: 25 million", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the specific entity that introduced the plague, which is the Genoese traders. Rule 13 applies because names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Genoese traders.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease\" is in passive voice, meaning that the subject (the army) is being acted upon by the verb (siege). Therefore, the answer is \"Mongol army\".\nThe answer: Mongol army", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants.\" This means that the Mongol army threw infected corpses in their catapults.\nThe answer: infected corpses", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location where the Genoese traders brought the plague. Rule 3 states that location is a different concept from other concepts such as size, shape, age, and color.

Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the information about war, famine, and weather can be ignored. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: Kaffa in the Crimea", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for factors that made the Black Death more severe. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so those are not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that factors that made the Black Death more severe are the opposite of factors that would have made it less severe. The passage mentions war, famine, and weather as contributing factors, so the answer is: war, famine, and weather.", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A.

Rule 7 applies because the question asks for the direction the disease first moved in, which is a synonym for the direction it first spread in. \nThe answer: northwest", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: northwestern Russia", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 is relevant because it states that different concepts cannot be compared. Rule 8 is also relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is: European groups that had smaller trade relations with their neighbors, including the Kingdom of Poland, the majority of the Basque Country, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent, were somewhat less affected by the plague.", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location where the disease was spreading between 1348 and 1350. Rule 3 reminds us that location is an important concept. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use the fact that the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. Therefore, we can say that the disease was spreading across Europe during this time. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: Europe", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the specific time when a plague-ridden ship landed in Norway, which is a specific event in the passage. Therefore, rules related to time and events are relevant. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from time, so we can ignore any information about how long ago the event happened. Rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about animals. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the specific time period mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: 1349", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the effect of the plague on the Middle East, which is a different concept from other regions mentioned in the article. The use of \"did\" in the question indicates a negation, making rule 17 relevant. The answer should reflect the opposite of the presence of the plague, which is a lack of depopulation and permanent change in economic and social structures. \nThe answer: The plague led to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"By autumn 1347, the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt.\" This is an active sentence where the subject (the plague) acts the verb (reached). Therefore, the answer is \"autumn 1347.\" \nThe answer: autumn 1347", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the plague reached Alexandria through the port's trade with Constantinople and ports on the Black Sea. This means that the plague infiltrated Alexandria through trade and travel. The use of \"probably\" in the passage indicates uncertainty, so it is important to note that this is not a definitive answer.\nThe answer: through trade and travel", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the residents of Antioch fled to the north. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which implies that the direction of north is the answer.\nThe answer: North", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Gasquet", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions Gasquet's claim that the Latin name for Black Death is \"atra mors.\"\nThe answer: atra mors", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Gasquet", "{rule list: 3, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the medieval epidemic was not called the Black Death in England until 1823.\nThe answer: 1823.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the order in which the name \"Black Death\" spread through Scandinavia and Germany. Rule 3 states that concepts such as location are different from concepts such as size or color, so it is irrelevant to the answer which region was affected first. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the question had asked which region was affected last, the answer would be England. However, since the question asks about the order of spread, the answer is that it is irrelevant.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"the heavens\" are being compared to \"bad air\" as potential causes of the plague. Rule 3 applies because \"the heavens\" and \"bad air\" are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the original cause, and the passage states that the medical faculty in Paris blamed the conjunction of three planets in 1345. \nThe answer: the conjunction of three planets in 1345", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the king of France", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the widely accepted theory today is that the plague was spread by fleas on rats, which is not the same as the Miasma theory that blamed bad air. The rules used are: 1 (to understand that the newer theory is different from the older one), 3 (to understand that \"spread\" and \"cause\" are different concepts), 4 (to understand that the theory is a concept different from the medical term \"plague\"), 5 (to understand that the spread of the plague is not related to animals or vehicles), 8 (to understand that the newer theory is the antonym of the older one), and 17 (to understand that negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: The newer, more widely accepted theory is that the plague was spread by fleas on rats, not by bad air.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The bad air theory is referred to as the Miasma theory.\nThe answer: Miasma theory", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer mentions that the Black Death and the epidemic in southern China were both attributed to the same pathogen, Yersinia pestis. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer that the epidemics affected different regions. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B, but this rule is not applicable in this case. \nThe answer: Yersinia pestis", "{rule list: 13, 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that the investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was Alexandre Yersin. Yersin is mentioned after the information about the investigation, so we use rule 22 to determine that he is the latter of the two entities mentioned. Therefore, the answer is: Hong Kong in 1894.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The article explains that Yersinia pestis was named after the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin. Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that Yersin is the person after whom the pathogen was named, not the other way around. Rule 2 applies because it establishes that Yersin is the most X (in this case, relevant) person in this context, while the other scientists mentioned are somewhat X. Rule 13 applies because names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Alexandre Yersin", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted, involving the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the bubonic plague mechanism was dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. This relates to rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5, which states that animals and vehicles are different concepts.\nThe answer: Two populations of rodents", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the person who wrote about the great pestilence in 1893. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a name in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in the question or passage. \nThe answer: Francis Aidan Gasquet", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Gasquet believed that the \"Great Pestilence\" was some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague.\nThe answer: bubonic plague", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time, which can be answered by identifying the edition of Gasquet's book where he implicated rats and fleas in the process of the Black Death. This requires understanding that \"second edition\" refers to a later version of the book and that passive voice is used in the sentence to indicate that Gasquet did not publish the second edition himself. \nThe answer: 1908", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Gasquet's book blamed the plague on \"some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\", which is a synonym for the bubonic plague. Therefore, rule 3 (synonyms are important for the answer) and rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B) apply.\nThe answer: Gasquet's book blamed the plague on the bubonic plague.", "{3, 7, 8}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the bubonic plague and its spread through rats and fleas. Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as different types of plagues, should not be confused. Rule 7 states that synonyms may be used in the question, so \"another plague\" can refer to a different type of plague. Rule 8 states that if two entities are compared, their antonyms can be used to describe their relationship. Therefore, the answer is the Justinian plague. \nThe answer: Justinian plague", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the mortality rate is a measure of how deadly the disease is, so a higher mortality rate means more deaths. Rule 2 applies because the bubonic plague is specifically mentioned as \"modern,\" so it is the most X form of the disease. Rule 3 applies because mortality rate is a different concept from the symptoms listed. \nThe answer: 30-75%", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the symptoms of bubonic plague include fever of 38-41\u00b0C (100-106\u00b0F). This means that the fever can run as high as 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F). Rule 2 applies because \"very/somewhat X\" (in this case, \"fever\") implies a range of values, with the highest being \"most X.\" Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the degree of the fever, which is a comparison of values. \nThe answer: 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F)", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares mortality rates of different forms of the plague. Rule 2 applies because it compares the mortality rate of untreated victims to the mortality rate of those who receive treatment. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the negation of a statement. \nThe answer: 80%", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Rule 2 applies because \"mortality rate\" is a comparative concept, and the passage provides a comparison to other forms of plague. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negation, and the answer requires understanding that a high mortality rate means a low survival rate. \nThe answer: 90 to 95 percent", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Skin-related symptoms are not mentioned in the passage, but the passage does mention that sputum becomes free flowing and bright red as the disease progresses. This suggests that the answer is not related to skin, but rather to the color of the sputum. Therefore, rule 3 (color is a different concept from other characteristics) and rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A) are relevant. \nThe answer: blood-tinged sputum", "{rule list: typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer}\nExplanation: The question is clear and straightforward, and there are no relevant rules to apply.\nThe answer: October 2010", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: investigating the role of Yersinia pestis in the Black Death", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the scientists used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques to assess the presence of DNA/RNA of Yersinia pestis. This falls under rule 3, as the technique used is related to the concept of \"methodology\", and rule 7, as \"PCR\" is a technical term that may not be familiar to all readers. \nThe answer: with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The scientists used PCR techniques to assess the presence of Y. pestis DNA/RNA in tooth sockets of human skeletons from mass graves in Europe associated with the Black Death. The article states that the authors concluded that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages.\nThe answer: tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in Europe", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The paper published in PLoS Pathogens concludes that Yersinia pestis was the causative agent of the Black Death that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages.\nThe answer: Yersinia pestis was the causative agent of the Black Death.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: Clades are genetic branches.\nThe answer: Genetic branches.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article mentions two previously unknown clades of the Y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves, which were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the Y. pestis strains Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis. This suggests that the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. \nThe answer: Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The plague may have entered Europe in two waves.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes that the first variant of Y. pestis entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349. \nThe answer: Through the port of Marseille in November 1347.", "{1, 2, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they establish the relationship between the time the plague entered Europe and when it reached England. Rule 7 is relevant because the question asks for a specific date. Rule 13 is relevant because the answer requires a specific location. \nThe answer: in the spring of 1349", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The Haensch study has been confirmed and amended based on genetic evidence from Black Death victims. \nThe answer: The results of the Haensch study have been confirmed and amended.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The location of the burial site is important for answering the question. Negations are also important to note. \nThe answer: East Smithfield in England", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Y. pestis variant that caused the Black Death \"may no longer exist,\" indicating that it has likely gone extinct. This is supported by rule 3, which states that age is a different concept from other attributes, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the Y. pestis variant that caused the Black Death is no longer present, so it can be inferred that it has gone extinct. \nThe answer: It may no longer exist.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the publication date of a study on sequenced Y genomes. The relevant information is \"A study published in Nature in October 2011 sequenced the genome of Y. pestis from plague victims.\" This is a passive sentence, so we need to look for the object (\"the genome of Y. pestis\") and the verb (\"sequenced\"). The answer is \"October 2011\". \nThe answer: October 2011", "{1, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it is stated that J.F.D. Shrewsbury challenged the plague theory first, which implies that there were later challengers. Rule 7 applies because \"challenged\" is a synonym for \"significantly challenged.\" Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a person's name. \nThe answer: J.F.D. Shrewsbury", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Shrewsbury noted that the reported rates of mortality during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.\nThe answer: He noted that the reported rates of mortality were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: contemporary accounts were exaggerations", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for what Graham Twigg published in 1984, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Graham Twigg is a person's name and \"published\" is the verb. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, we can infer that the sentence \"Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly\" is in the active voice and that the answer is \"the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly\". \nThe answer: the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Samuel K. Cohn, Jr.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms.\" This means that understanding how the plague spreads and affects populations is just as important as recognizing the symptoms of the disease.\nThe answer: An epidemiological account of the plague", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that researchers are struggling to identify the history of the plague because of the lack of reliable statistics from the time period. This is due to the fact that no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377, and estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy. Therefore, rules 3 (different concepts), 7 (synonyms), and 17 (negations) are relevant. \nThe answer: Due to the lack of reliable statistics from the time period.", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 2, as the question asks for the extent of variation in estimations of the population during the plague. The answer is \"by over 100%\". Rule 8 also applies, as it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the antonym of \"vary\" is \"consistent\", so the answer could also be \"estimates of overall population at the start vary greatly\".", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that estimates of overall population in England during the time of the plague are difficult to determine due to the lack of reliable statistics. However, estimates are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy. This means that the clergy's records are used to estimate the population. \nThe answer: figures from the clergy", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are therefore irrelevant to the answer. Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, but the sentence \"no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377\" is relevant. Negations are important for the answer, so we need to identify the years during which no census was taken. \nThe answer: between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. This means that just because the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique, it does not necessarily mean that it is not the plague. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, if the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, then it is more likely that something else was responsible for the plague. \nThe answer: The rat population was insufficient to account for the plague.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that sceptics argue that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance, meaning that it was not a significant factor in the spread of the disease.\nThe answer: of marginal significance", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The temperature is relevant because it is argued that the cold temperatures in northern Europe would not have allowed fleas to survive and spread the bubonic plague. This contradicts the theory that the Black Death was caused by bubonic plague. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) and rule 8 (antonyms) are relevant. \nThe answer: The theory of plague spreading via fleas in goods is unlikely due to the cold temperatures in northern Europe.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article compares the spread of the Black Death (which is believed to be bubonic plague) to modern bubonic plague and argues that the Black Death spread much faster despite primitive transport systems. Therefore, the answer is: the Black Death (believed to be bubonic plague) spread faster than modern bubonic plague.", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague.\" This means that outbreaks of the Black Death could be separated by 5 to 15 years.\nThe answer: 5 to 15 years", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: It may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. If A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer is a combination of diseases, including bubonic plague, typhus, smallpox, and respiratory infections. \nThe answer: bubonic plague, typhus, smallpox, and respiratory infections", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but it is not necessary for this question.\nThe answer: A type of \"blood poisoning\"", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that Public Health England examined 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London.\nThe answer: 25", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the death rate in the Middle East due to the plague. The passage provides an estimate of about a third, which is a comparison to the death rates in other regions. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the death rate in the Middle East is not the same as the death rate in other regions. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the death rate in the Middle East is more than the death rate in some regions, so the death rate in those regions is less than the death rate in the Middle East. \nThe answer: about a third", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died.\" This is a comparison of the population before and after the plague, indicating that Paris lost 50% of its population due to the Black Death.\nThe answer: 50%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and size are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that if isolated, evenly spaced graves were found, it suggests pre-planning and Christian burials is relevant. This indicates that at least some thought and care was put into the burial of the victims, rather than just throwing them into mass burial pits. \nThe answer: Some pre-planning and Christian burials took place.", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the death rate in different regions. Rule 2 applies because the question asks about the number of deaths in relation to population size. Rule 3 applies because size is a different concept from death rate. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the number of deaths in relation to population size, which is the opposite of the death rate. \nThe answer: as much as 50% of the population", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.\" This implies that areas that were more isolated were less vulnerable to the disease. Therefore, rule 3 (location is important for the answer) and rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B) are relevant. \nThe answer: the most isolated areas", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article provides a list of years in which the plague was present in Europe, so we need to identify the time frame. Rules 1 and 2 help us understand that the years listed are the most widespread outbreaks. Rule 3 tells us that we should focus on the concept of time. Rule 8 helps us understand that if the plague was present every year between 1346 and 1671, then it returned to Europe in 1346. \nThe answer: 1346", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"France alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628\u201331.\" This directly answers the question.\nThe answer: almost a million", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Historians proposed a range of pre-incident population figures in the absence of census figures.\nThe answer: proposed a range of pre-incident population figures", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided.\" This means that the Black Death technically subsided at the end of 1350.\nThe answer: end of 1350", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage does not provide an exact number for the death toll in the outbreak of 1471, but it states that it took as much as 10-15% of the population. Using rule 3, we know that population and death toll are different concepts, so we can infer that the death toll was a percentage of the population. Using rule 8, we know that if the outbreak took 10-15% of the population, then the population decreased by that same percentage. Therefore, we can estimate that the death toll in the outbreak of 1471 was between 400,000 and 600,000 people (assuming a pre-incident population of 4 million). \nThe answer: between 400,000 and 600,000 people", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a specific event, which can be found in the last sentence of the passage. The use of \"the\" before \"Great Plague of London\" indicates that it is a specific event. The relevant rules are 3 (to distinguish between concepts), 16 (to understand the chronological order of events), and 17 (to recognize negations). \nThe answer: 1665", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage directly states that \"perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris\" in 1466. The year is mentioned first, so rule 16 applies to determine that this is the answer. Rule 13 applies to confirm that the number given is indeed the answer to the question.\nThe answer: 40,000", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country that the Black Death continued on into after ravaging Europe for three years. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is Russia.\nThe answer: Russia", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We can eliminate rules 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 as they are not relevant to the question. Rule 7 is not applicable as there are no synonyms in the question. Rule 18 is not applicable as there are no negations in the question. From the passage, we can see that the Italian Plague of 1629-1631 is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War. Therefore, rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) is relevant as it helps us focus on the specific outbreak mentioned in the question. Rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A) and rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) are also relevant as they help us eliminate other outbreaks that are not associated with troop movements. \nThe answer: Italian Plague of ", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is asking for a specific date, which is not provided in the article. Rules 3 and 10 are not relevant to this question. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The article mentions several historical outbreaks of the plague, but does not provide information about the most recent outbreak. Therefore, the answer is \"The article does not provide information about the date of the last plague outbreak.\"", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of times the plague occurred in Venice, which is a specific piece of information mentioned in the passage. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts such as \"number\" are different from concepts such as \"color\" or \"profession.\" Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use this rule to infer that if Venice had 22 outbreaks of the plague between 1361 and 1528, then it did not have more than 22 outbreaks. \nThe answer: 22", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific number, which is a quantitative concept. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from color, shape, age, and profession. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use the antonym of \"killed\" which is \"survived\" to rephrase the question as \"How many people survived the plague in Italy in the 17th century?\" \nThe answer: 300,000", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about various plague epidemics in different parts of Europe, but the question specifically asks about the number of deaths in Naples in 1656. Therefore, rule 3 (color, shape, age, and size are different concepts) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) are relevant. \nThe answer: about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants (or approximately 150,000 people) were killed by the plague in 1656.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the plague of 1649 \"probably reduced the population of Seville by half.\" This means that approximately half of Seville's population died from the plague.\nThe answer: Half of the population of Seville (approximately)", "{rule list: 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the mention of Sweden and Russia in the context does not necessarily imply that they are the nationalities of people fighting in the war. The rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the information about the plague epidemics is not relevant to the question. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for the opposite of \"who fought\" in the context. The answer: Sweden v. Russia and allies.", "{3, 10, 12}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so minor errors in the question do not affect the answer. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so information about plagues in other countries and time periods is not relevant. \nThe answer: 1720", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Plague was present in at least one location in the Islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850.\" Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other attributes, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is: between 1500 and 1850.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Algiers lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to the plague in 1620-21.\nThe answer: 30 to 50 thousand", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Plague remained a major event in Ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century.\" This means that the plague lasted in the Ottoman empire until the early 1800s.\nThe answer: until the second quarter of the 19th century", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article provides information about several instances of plague outbreaks in Baghdad, but it does not give a specific number for the maximum death toll. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that size is not a relevant concept for this question. However, rule 8 tells us that if we know the minimum number of deaths, we can use the antonym of \"at most\" to find the maximum number. Since the article mentions that \"sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out,\" we can use the antonym of \"two-thirds\" (one-third) to estimate that at most, one-third of Baghdad's population may have died from plague. \nThe answer: At most, one-third of Baghdad's population may have died from plague.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: melt (magma and/or lava)", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: Sedimentary rock can be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure, which changes the mineral content of the rock and gives it a characteristic fabric. \nThe answer: metamorphic rock", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: According to rule 3, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks are different concepts. Rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks about what is formed when the three types of rock are re-melted, which implies that they lose their original characteristics and become something new. Therefore, the answer is a new magma, as stated in the passage. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, but this rule is not relevant for this question. \n\nThe answer: a new magma", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The article explicitly states that there are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so these are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so this is also not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\" Heat and pressure change the mineral content of a rock, which gives it a characteristic fabric. Therefore, the answer is \"heat and pressure.\"", "{1, 3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The most important discovery that led to the understanding that Earth's lithosphere is separated into tectonic plates was seafloor spreading, which is a process related to the movement of the plates. Therefore, rules 1 and 5, which differentiate between concepts such as animals and vehicles, and professions and nationalities, respectively, are not relevant. The answer is seafloor spreading.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The lithosphere includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle.\nThe answer: crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any options that refer to those concepts. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore any minor spelling errors. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative words in the question. \nThe answer: asthenosphere", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the answer should come after \"surface of the Earth.\" Rule 23 states that there is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle, so the answer is \"the convecting mantle.\" \nThe answer: the convecting mantle.", "{rule list: 1, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states \"In the 1960s, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was seafloor spreading...\" The relevant rules are 1 (to understand that \"discovery\" is synonymous with \"finding\"), 10 (to ignore contractions), 12 (to ignore irrelevant information), and 17 (to understand that negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: 1960s", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that mid-ocean ridges are explained as divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart. This means that when two plates move apart, it forms a mid-ocean ridge. \nThe answer: mid-ocean ridge", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be \"subduction zone\" or any other description of the area's shape or size. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if one plate subducts under another, the other plate is overriding. \nThe answer: subduction zone", "{3, 6, 8}\nExplanation: We can use rule 3 to determine that the type of fault boundary is a different concept from the state of California. Rule 6 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts, which is irrelevant to this question. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, if we know that the San Andreas fault system results in widespread powerful earthquakes, we can infer that it is a transform boundary. \nThe answer: transform boundary", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it says \"Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift\". Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, and rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Alfred Wegener", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The theory of plate tectonics explains how the lithosphere, which is the solid outer layer of the Earth, moves over the convecting mantle. This is in accordance with rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 23, which states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb.\nThe answer: convecting", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: Seismologists use seismic waves to image the interior of the Earth.\nThe answer: seismic waves", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below, and the outer core and inner core below that. Therefore, the outermost layer is the crust.\nThe answer: crust", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3, which states that \"profession and nationality are different concepts,\" is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between different concepts. Rule 8, which states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A,\" is also relevant because it helps us understand that if there are seismic discontinuities at certain depths in the Earth, then there are no seismic discontinuities at other depths. Therefore, the answer is: the mantle, separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers.", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and animals and vehicles are different concepts. These rules are relevant because they help eliminate irrelevant information about the Earth's interior. \nThe answer: Wave speeds", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the layered model of the Earth consists of a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below, and the outer core and inner core below that. The mantle is separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers, so the two layers below the mantle are the outer core and inner core.\nThe answer: outer core and inner core", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The second timeline is needed because the first timeline compresses the most recent eon, and the second timeline expands the scale of the most recent eon. This is in accordance with rule 3, which states that size is a different concept, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Additionally, rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The second timeline is needed to expand the scale of the most recent eon.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, which is relevant because the question asks about which timeline is expanded, not which is larger. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, which is relevant because the question asks about which timeline is expanded last. \nThe answer: The Quaternary period timeline is further expanded in the fourth scale.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The article discusses four timelines showing the geologic time scale, with each subsequent timeline expanding on the previous one. The fourth timeline shows the Quaternary period, which is further expanded to show the Holocene epoch. Therefore, the answer is the Holocene epoch.\nThe answer: Holocene", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, which means that the Pleistocene epoch being an age is not the same as it being a period. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if the Pleistocene epoch takes place during a certain period, then it cannot take place during any other period. \nThe answer: Quaternary period", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: principle of cross-cutting relationships", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"age\" and \"shape\" are different concepts applies here, as the question is asking about the relative age of the rock formations and the fault. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" also applies, as the question is asking about whether the formations are older or younger than the fault. \nThe answer: The formations must be younger than the fault.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The principle of cross-cutting relationships helps to determine if a fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.\nThe answer: The principle of cross-cutting relationships", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the fault is younger than the rocks it cuts, so the rocks on top of the fault must be younger than the fault itself. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, if the rocks on top of the fault were older than the fault, it would contradict the principle of cross-cutting relationships, so the answer is that the rocks on top of a fault that are cut are always younger than the fault itself. \nThe answer: younger", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that xenoliths are foreign bodies that are picked up as magma or lava flows and are incorporated into igneous rocks, later to cool in the matrix. The passage also states that xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them. Therefore, the answer is xenoliths. \nThe answer: xenoliths", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"shape\" and \"age\" are different concepts is irrelevant to the question. The rule that \"size\" is a different concept is partially relevant, as it helps to understand what xenoliths are. However, the most relevant rule is that if A is older than B, then B contains A. This applies to the concept of xenoliths, which are foreign bodies picked up by magma or lava flows and incorporated into the matrix of igneous rocks. Therefore, the answer is: magma or lava flows.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion between the term \"inclusions\" and any synonyms that may refer to size, shape, or color. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to infer that if \"inclusions\" are found in a formation, then the formation must be younger than the inclusions. Therefore, a synonym for \"inclusions\" in sedimentary rocks would be \"clasts\".\nThe answer: clasts", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a comparison between inclusions and the formation that contains them. Rule 3 applies because the question specifically mentions sedimentary rocks. \nThe answer: The principle of inclusions and components.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If inclusions are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. Therefore, the answer is gravel. \nThe answer: Gravel", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The principle based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks is called the principle of faunal succession. This is a straightforward question that only requires knowledge of the definition of the principle. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that the principle is based on the appearance of fossils, which is a different concept from the rocks themselves. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a principle that is based on something, and the use of \"based on\" implies a positive statement rather than a negation. \nThe answer: principle of faunal succession", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person whose principles were the basis for the principle of faunal succession. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, such as profession or nationality, so we can eliminate any rules related to those concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can apply it to the fact that the principle of faunal succession was developed almost a hundred years before Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, so we can say that the principles were not based on Darwin's ideas. Therefore, the answer is William Smith. \n\nThe answer: William Smith", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The fact that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time is a negation that affects the application of the principle of faunal succession, making it less reliable. \nThe answer: less reliable.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article discusses the principle of faunal succession, which is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. The presence or absence of fossils can be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found. The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts) and 8 (antonyms). \"Presence\" and \"absence\" are antonyms, so if the presence of fossils can be used to determine relative age, then the absence of fossils can also be used to determine relative age. \nThe answer: fossils", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The principle of faunal succession was developed almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. This means that the principle was developed before Darwin's theory, which is a chronological relationship. This is covered by rule 16, which states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Additionally, this question involves a passive sentence (\"The principle becomes quite complex...\"), which is covered by rule 23, stating that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb.\"\nThe answer: Charles Darwin", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The ability to use radioactive isotopes to date rock formations was developed at the beginning of the 20th century.\nThe answer: at the beginning of the 20th century", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks about the type of correlation used previously, implying that there is a new type of correlation being used now. The answer is \"stratigraphic correlation.\" \nThe answer: stratigraphic correlation", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that isotopic dating made it possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, which could then be applied to fossil sequences to convert old relative ages into new absolute ages.\nThe answer: absolute ages", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it establishes that the method of dating rocks using fossils and stratigraphic correlation is based on relative age, not absolute age. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because it helps to understand that isotopic dating provides absolute ages, which are the opposite of relative ages. \nThe answer: other rock units", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" means that we can infer that the absolute isotopic date is not related to any of these concepts. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" means that if we rephrase the question as \"what is the concept to which the absolute isotopic date is applied when dating rocks?\", the answer would be \"rock units\". \nThe answer: rock units", "{3, 5, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that thermochemical techniques can be used to determine paleotopography. This falls under the category of geochronologic and thermochronologic studies, which involve measuring isotope ratios of radioactive elements in minerals to determine the age of rocks and the temperature profiles within the crust. The passage also mentions other methods such as uranium-lead dating and potassium-argon dating, but these are not relevant to the question. \nThe answer: thermochemical techniques", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts.\nThe answer: closure temperature", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals to determine the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature. These ratios are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. \nThe answer: isotope ratios of radioactive elements", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: Sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes can be dated by dating lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence using absolute dating techniques such as uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating, and uranium-thorium dating. This is possible because the age of the volcanic material can be determined using radioactive isotopes, and the sedimentary rock units can be dated based on their relationship to the volcanic material. \nThe answer: By dating lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence using absolute dating techniques.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a comparison between thickness and length, which are opposite concepts. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that thickness and length are different concepts. \nThe answer: horizontal compression", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that thrust faults form in the shallow crust where brittle deformation can occur. This means that they do not form deeper in the Earth where rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. Additionally, the passage does not mention anything about the location of thrust faults in relation to other types of faults. \nThe answer: in the shallow crust", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from age, and Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the specific type of fold that occurs when rock units buckle upwards, which is an \"antiform\".", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the term used to describe a type of fold that occurs when rock units buckle downwards. Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other concepts, so it is important to focus on the description of the fold. Rule 8 is relevant because it helps to understand that if one type of fold is described, the other type is the opposite. \nThe answer: synform", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is relevant because the question is asking for a specific term to describe a certain type of fold. The answer: anticlines.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that extension causes rock units to become longer and thinner. Rule 3 applies because size and shape are different concepts. \nThe answer: Extension causes the rock unit to become longer and thinner.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the answer is \"boudins\" because the passage describes how stretched rocks can pinch into lenses, which are known as boudins.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that stretching of rock units can result in their thinning, and there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt where the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter. Therefore, the answer is: within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. Therefore, the answer is metamorphosed. \nThe answer: metamorphosed.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that rock extension is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and ductile stretching and thinning. This means that the rocks become longer and thinner due to these processes. Rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, so we can't confuse them. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can't say that the rocks become shorter and thicker due to extension. \nThe answer: normal faulting and ductile stretching and thinning.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Long and planar are both adjectives describing the type of igneous intrusion. Therefore, the answer should be a synonym for \"igneous intrusion.\" \nThe answer: Dike", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates size, shape, age, and color from other concepts, so it is not relevant. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if the passage says \"enter along cracks,\" then the answer is not \"exit from cracks.\" Rule 16 is relevant because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which means that if the passage mentions lava tubes before dikes, then the answer is \"along cracks.\" \nThe answer: along cracks", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks about the type of gradients formed by faulting and other deformational processes, which implies that there are different types of gradients. The answer is that faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that \"Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment.\" Rule 3 applies because \"maintaining topographic gradients\" is a different concept from \"deposition of sediments\" or \"volcanism and igneous activity.\" \nThe answer: Continual motion along the fault", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The rules selected ensure that we focus on the relevant information in the passage and avoid confusion with irrelevant details or synonyms. The answer to the question is found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that deformational events are often associated with volcanism and igneous activity. \nThe answer: volcanism and igneous activity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being \"layered basaltic lava flows\" or \"sedimentary rocks.\" The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to infer that the answer is not \"sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks.\" Therefore, the answer is \"layered basaltic lava flows.\" \nThe answer: Layered basaltic lava flows.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Acasta gneiss", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the type of rock is not related to these factors. Rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, which is also not relevant to the question. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is important for understanding that the Grand Canyon is located in the southwestern United States. Therefore, the answer is: sedimentary rock.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the sedimentary sequences of the Grand Canyon have remained in place since Cambrian time. \nThe answer: Cambrian time", "{rule list: 3, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses different types of geological formations and how they can be complex and occur in stages. The oldest known rock in the world is mentioned as being located in the Slave craton in northwestern Canada. The rules of size, shape, and color are not relevant to this question, and neither are profession or nationality. Animals and vehicles are also not relevant. The answer does not require any pronoun or name resolution.\nThe answer: northwestern Canada", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Petrology is the study of rocks.\nThe answer: the study of rocks", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Stratigraphy is the study of sedimentary layers.\nThe answer: The study of sedimentary layers.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Structural geology is the study of positions of rock units and their deformation.\nThe answer: The study of positions of rock units and their deformation.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Geologists study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers.\nThe answer: modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Petrologists use electron microprobes in the laboratory to analyze individual locations for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.\nThe answer: to analyze individual locations for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates those properties as possible answers. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the question asks for a specific property analyzed with a conoscopic lens, which is a more specific method of analysis than optical microscopy in general. Therefore, the answer is interference properties. \nThe answer: interference properties", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units.\nThe answer: the geochemical evolution of rock units.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory.\nThe answer: laboratory", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes two primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory: optical microscopy and electron microprobe. The question specifically asks about the type of microscope used, which is optical microscopy. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as type of microscope and method of identification. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which applies to the fact that electron microprobe is the other primary method mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: petrographic microscope", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks how petrologists can understand the pressures at which different mineral phases appear, so the answer is that they can use fluid inclusion data and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments.", "{3, 6, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, animals and vehicles are different concepts, and negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Petrologists can use high temperature and pressure physical experiments to understand the temperatures at which different mineral phases appear.", "{3, 4, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts (rule 3), profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4), and in this case, the relevant rule is that data from physical experiments can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks (rule 23). \nThe answer: Metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes how structural geologists use microscopic analysis to observe the fabric within rocks, which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks. Negation is important because the question asks for the type of geologists that give information about strain, not the type that do not. Additionally, the passage specifically mentions \"structural geologists.\" \nThe answer: structural geologists", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks. \nThe answer: through microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. However, rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which is relevant because the question asks about what structural geologists do with measurements of geological structures. The answer is that they plot and combine those measurements. \nThe answer: They plot and combine them.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Structural geologists perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.\nThe answer: analog and numerical experiments", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any potential confusion about what the answer is referring to. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" helps to clarify that the answer is not referring to the process of building mountains, but rather the specific zones in which they are built. \nThe answer: orogenic wedges", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a type of experiment in structural geology. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts and not relevant to the answer. Rule 5 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts and not relevant to the answer. Rule 6 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts and not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for similar phrases to \"experiments in structural geology.\" Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, but there are no names in this passage. \nThe answer: experiments involving orogenic wedges", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The answer is \"horizontal layers of sand\". Rule 8 also applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"sand\" is more specific than \"layers\", so the answer is \"sand\". \nThe answer: sand", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because \"critically tapered\" is a comparative term, implying that there are other levels of tapering that are not as critical. The rule 8 applies because \"critically tapered\" is a positive term, so the antonym would be \"uncritically tapered.\" \nThe answer: All angles remain the same.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"more sophisticated\" implies a comparison, and according to the rule, if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Rule 3 applies because \"sophistication\" refers to a concept, and according to the rule, size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. \nThe answer: numerical models", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field, such as those from drill cores. According to rule 3, profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer is not \"drillers\" or \"geologists\" but \"stratigraphers.\" According to rule 16, first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"stratigraphers\" should come before \"drillers\" or \"geologists\" in the answer. \nThe answer: Stratigraphers.", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: Geophysical surveys show the location of stratigraphic units in the subsurface, as stated in the passage. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Geophysical surveys", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface. This combines the concepts of analyzing geophysical surveys and using computer programs to create a 3D view of the subsurface. \nThe answer: well logs", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Stratigraphers use computer programs to view their data in three dimensions.\nThe answer: computer programs", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13}\nExplanation: Stratigraphers use data to locate areas for water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction.\nThe answer: water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from size, shape, and color. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Rule 23 states that geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition.\nThe answer: to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and \"who\" refers to a person, so the answer must be a person's name, which is not provided in the article. However, the article states that \"biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them,\" so the answer is biostratigraphers.\nThe answer: Biostratigraphers", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. These rules help us identify that magnetic stratigraphers are a different type of scientist than biostratigraphers and geochronologists. \nThe answer: Magnetic stratigraphers.", "{rule list: 3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts such as size, shape, age, and color from each other. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Rule 23 states that geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section. \nThe answer: Geochronologists", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses the origins of the science of geology and mentions the opinion of Fielding H. Garrison that it can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. The article also mentions the works of Persian geologists Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni and Ibn Sina, who made significant contributions to the field. The answer is Persia.\nThe answer: Persia", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of the Persian geologist who lived from 973-1048 CE. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a person who inferred how land was formed in China. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts such as location and scientific theories are different, so we can ignore the mention of China and focus on the person's name. Rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Shen Kuo", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a person who proposed explanations for the origins of earthquakes and the formation of mountains. Rule 1 applies because it establishes that if A proposes more explanations than B, then B proposes fewer explanations than A. Rule 2 applies because it establishes that if A proposes detailed explanations and B proposes general explanations, then A proposes the most detailed explanations and B proposes the least detailed explanations. Rule 13 applies because it establishes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Ibn Sina (Avicenna)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Shen Kuo observed fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: James Hutton", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Theory of the Earth", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage mentions that Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas, and then specifies the volumes as \"Vol. 1, Vol. 2.\" Therefore, the first volume was published before the second volume.\nThe answer: 1795", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Earth must be much older than previously thought in order to allow enough time for geological processes to occur.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the first person mentioned in the text is the one who produced the first geological map of the U.S. The rule 23 is also relevant because it establishes that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which means that the answer will be found in the sentence where the first geological map of the U.S. is mentioned. \nThe answer: William Maclure", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year, which is a numerical value and can be directly extracted from the passage. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that William Maclure produced the first geological map of the U.S. before William Smith produced the geological map of England. Rule 22 establishes that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so we know that the first geological map of the U.S. was produced by William Maclure.\nThe answer: 1809", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1807", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: American Philosophical Society", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that \"his famous book\" refers to the book mentioned in the first sentence, which is \"Principles of Geology.\" The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence structure of the question is passive, and we need to look for the subject and verb in the context. \nThe answer: Principles of Geology", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the doctrine promoted by the Principles of Geology, which is uniformitarianism. Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A promotes X, then B promotes the opposite of X. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of doctrine and theory. Rule 17 applies because it notes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: uniformitarianism", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the theory that slow geological processes are still occurring today, which implies that they have occurred in the past. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a concept, which is the theory, not a physical attribute like size or shape. \nThe answer: Uniformitarianism", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses two theories about how Earth's features formed: uniformitarianism and catastrophism. Uniformitarianism states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth's history and are still occurring today, while catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. The question is asking for the name of the theory that states that Earth's features remained unchanged after forming in one single catastrophic event, which is catastrophism.\nThe answer: catastrophism", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a famous evolutionist who was influenced by Principles of Geology, which is mentioned in the article as having influenced the thought of Charles Darwin. The relevant rules are 1 (if A influenced B, then B was influenced by A) and 13 (names are equally important for the answer). \nThe answer: Charles Darwin.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Newcastle is 103 miles south of Edinburgh.\nThe answer: 103", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Newcastle is \"8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea.\"\nThe answer: 8.5 miles", "{3, 13, 14}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Newcastle is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.

Rule 3 states that names are different concepts from size, shape, age, and color, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we know that the nickname is a crucial piece of information. \nThe answer: Geordie", "{rule list: 1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The city developed around the Roman settlement Pons Aelius and was named after the castle built in 1080 by Robert Curthose, William the Conqueror's eldest son.\" Rule 1 applies because it mentions Robert Curthose's relationship to William the Conqueror. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of age and name. Rule 13 applies because the name is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Robert Curthose", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the city grew as an important center for the wool trade in the 14th century. This means that wool trade was a significant part of the city's economy during that time period.\nThe answer: Wool trade", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The article states that the city became a major coal mining area. \nThe answer: coal", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the port of Newcastle developed in the 16th century.\nThe answer: 16th century", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Great North Run", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle. Rule 3 tells us that \"location\" is important for the answer, so we need to look for information about the settlement's location. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last,\" so we can assume that Pons Aelius is the correct answer since it is the first settlement mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: Pons Aelius", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" The passage states that the first recorded settlement in Newcastle was Pons Aelius, a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. Therefore, the answer is River Tyne. \nThe answer: River Tyne.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2,000", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Hadrian's Wall", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Hadrian's Wall was constructed primarily for defense, to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"unwanted immigration\" is the opposite of \"preventing invasion,\" so we can infer that the Romans were fearful of Pictish tribes invading from the North. \nThe answer: Pictish tribes", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Newcastle was England's northern fortress during the Middle Ages.\nThe answer: England", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that Newcastle was incorporated first by Henry II and then had a new charter granted by Elizabeth in 1589. This means that Elizabeth granted Newcastle a new charter after it was first incorporated by Henry II.\nThe answer: Elizabeth", "Rules: 3\nExplanation: The height of the stone wall built around Newcastle in the 13th century is a measurement of size.\nThe answer: 25 feet (7.6 m) high", "{rule list: 13, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174. This means that the answer is a person's name and that the person was a king of Scotland. The passage also mentions that William the Lion was brought south through the town by Edward I, which implies that William the Lion was not a willing participant in his imprisonment. Therefore, the sentence is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: William the Lion", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century, which means that the answer is 3.\nThe answer: 3", "{rules 3 and 8}\nExplanation: The royal act restricted shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen. Therefore, the act restricted shipments of coal.\nThe answer: coal", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that a cartel of Newcastle burgesses had a monopoly in the coal trade, which helped Newcastle prosper. This indicates that the answer to the question is \"the Hostmen\".\nThe answer: the Hostmen", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a pointless pursuit", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: Timothy Dexter's profession or nationality is not mentioned in the article, so rule 4 applies. However, the article does mention that Timothy Dexter was referred to as an entrepreneur and widely regarded as an eccentric, so rule 4 and 16 apply. Since Timothy is a male name, rule 20 applies and \"he\" refers to Timothy Dexter.\nThe answer: an eccentric entrepreneur", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about the plot of the Newcastle merchants towards Timothy Dexter. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A plots to do X to B, then B is the target of A's plot. Rule 7 applies because the question contains a synonym for \"plot\" which is \"do to\". Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"plot to ruin him\"). \nThe answer: The merchants plotted to ruin him.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: their families", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that keelmen worked on boats called keels, which were used to transfer coal from the river banks to colliers. \nThe answer: By using boats called keels.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"in the 1630s about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, more than one-third of the population.\" This means that approximately 33.3% of the population did not die of plague. Therefore, the answer is 7,000. \nThe answer: 7,000", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in the 1630s, about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, which is equivalent to 35% of the population. Specifically within the year 1636, it is estimated that 47% of the population died from the epidemic. \nThe answer: 47%", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a superlative comparison, indicating the use of the word \"most\". Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be related to any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the epidemic in Newcastle was the most severe in any British city at the time, then it was also the least severe in comparison to other cities. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we must take into account that the question is asking for the opposite of what is stated in the passage. \nThe answer: The epidemic in Newcastle was the least severe in any British city at the time.", "{rule list: 1, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the North declared for the King.\"\nThe answer: the King", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Cromwell's allies were the Scots.\nThe answer: the Scots", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: drummes", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The motto \"Fortiter Defendit Triumphans\" means \"Triumphing by a brave defence\".\nThe answer: Triumphing by a brave defence.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Charles I was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646\u20137\" is in the passive voice, meaning that Charles I is the subject being acted upon by the verb \"imprisoned.\" The rule about passive voice (23) and the rule about word order (16) are relevant here. \nThe answer: Charles I", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The Industrial Revolution was central to the city's prosperity and resulted in the urbanization of the city. This implies that the city grew and became more prosperous as a result of the Industrial Revolution.\nThe answer: The city grew and became more prosperous.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the history of Newcastle, including the fact that in 1817, the Maling company, which was at one time the largest pottery company in the world, moved to the city. The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size and profession are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Maling company", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage lists several innovations that were developed in Newcastle and surrounding areas, including safety lamps, electric light bulbs, and the steam turbine. The question asks for the specific innovation that Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to have, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, the fact that Newcastle became the seat of an Anglican diocese with St. Nicholas' Church becoming its cathedral suggests that the innovation was related to religion. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to eliminate options that are not related to religion, and rule 13 to prioritize the importance of names and locations. The answer is: a cathedral.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to Newcastle's prosperity in the 19th century.\nThe answer: prosperity", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the invention made by Charles Parsons.

It also mentions that Newcastle is among the driest cities in the UK and has milder winters and cooler summers. The relevant rules are 3 (clarifying that climate is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color) and 8 (noting that if a location is more or less of a certain climate than another location, the opposite is true for the other location). \nThe answer: Newcastle has an oceanic climate that is milder than other locations at a similar latitude, with milder winters and cooler summers, and is among the driest cities in the UK.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant here. The question asks about the kind of influence that the Gulf Stream exerts on Newcastle, so we can infer that the Gulf Stream has some kind of effect on the climate of Newcastle. The passage tells us that the Gulf Stream has a warming influence on Newcastle, which means that if the Gulf Stream did not exist, Newcastle would be colder. Therefore, we can say that the Gulf Stream exerts a cooling influence on Newcastle. \nThe answer: cooling", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that Newcastle is in the rain shadow of the North Pennines, meaning that the North Pennines cast a rain shadow over Newcastle.\nThe answer: rain shadow", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the coldest temperature, which is a measure of low temperature. Rule 3 states that temperature is a different concept from other attributes like size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we need to look for the opposite of low temperature, which is high temperature, and find the year when the highest temperature was recorded, then infer that the coldest temperature was recorded before that year.\nThe answer: August 1990.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage compares Newcastle's climate to other locations in the world at a similar latitude, but notes that it has milder winters and cooler summers, similar to the remainder of the British Isles.

Rule 1 applies because it states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A.\" Therefore, we can infer that other housing forms were less common than the Tyneside flat during this time. Rule 3 applies because it states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts.\" The question asks about the dominant housing template, which refers to the shape or form of the housing rather than its size, age, or color. \nThe answer: Tyneside flats", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Tyneside flats were built as terraces, with one door leading to an upstairs flat and the other leading to a ground-floor flat. This implies that Tyneside flats were built as a type of housing unit that was part of a larger structure. \nThe answer: terraces", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Tyneside flat as a housing form that was once dominant in the streetscape on both sides of the Tyne. It also mentions a new development in the Ouseburn valley that has recreated them. Therefore, we can infer that the housing style is being developed recently in the Ouseburn valley.\nThe answer: Ouseburn valley", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Cany Ash and Robert Sakula are architects.\nThe answer: architects", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The architects were attracted by the possibilities of high density without building high and getting rid of common areas.\nThe answer: high density housing without building high or getting rid of common areas", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The proportion of detached homes rose in the 2010 Census.\nThe answer: 7.8%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: \"within the highest of the five colour-coded brackets at 5.9%\" indicates that shared and converted houses are among the highest proportion of housing types in the area. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the color-coded brackets likely refer to some sort of classification system for housing types. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if shared and converted houses are among the highest proportion of housing types, then they are not among the lowest proportion of housing types. \nThe answer: Among the highest of the five color-coded brackets.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: historic densely occupied, arguably overinflated markets", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Overinflated markets in the local authorities", "{rule list: 3, 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage lists several local authorities with historic densely occupied, arguably overinflated markets, and the question asks for a market that is overinflated but not included in that list. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the listed authorities are all places does not mean that the answer must also be a place. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the answer must come after Brighton in the list. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last when two entities are listed, so we know that the answer must come after Brighton and be a single entity. \nThe answer: Tunbridge Wells.", "{1, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), rule 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer), and rule 17 (negations are important for the answer). The passage states that \"According to the UK Government's returned 2001 census information, the city of Newcastle had a population of 189,863.\" Therefore, the answer is 2001. \nThe answer: 2001", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the metropolitan borough of Newcastle had a population of around 259,000.\" This indicates that the question is asking for the population of a borough within Newcastle. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other characteristics, and rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" \nThe answer: the metropolitan borough of Newcastle", "{3, 13, 19}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a specific type of person in Newcastle, which is not related to profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles. Therefore, rules 3 and 19 apply. Additionally, the passage mentions that Newcastle is home to a large student population, so rule 13 applies to indicate that this is the relevant type of person. \nThe answer: students", "{4, 19}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a type of institution in Newcastle, which implies that the answer is a profession or a type of organization. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate nationality as a possible answer. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can eliminate gender as a factor in the answer. The only relevant information in the passage is that there are two universities in the local area, so the answer is: universities.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jesmond and Heaton are areas with a predominant student population. This information is not related to size, shape, age, or color, so rule 3 applies. Additionally, the passage mentions specific locations, so rule 13 applies. \nThe answer: a student population", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the average age of people living in Newcastle is 37.8, which is compared to the national average of 38.6. This means that the average age in Newcastle is slightly lower than the national average.\nThe answer: 37.8", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that age and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that people in Newcastle have Scottish or Irish ancestors is related to their nationality, not their age. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the type of people in Newcastle, which can be understood as the nationality of the people. The passage states that \"Many people in the city have Scottish or Irish ancestors\", which means that the type of people in Newcastle is Scottish or Irish. \nThe answer: Scottish or Irish (ancestry/nationality)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that age and nationality are different concepts, so the average age of people living in Newcastle is not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if there is a strong presence of Border Reiver surnames, then there is a weak presence of other types of surnames. \nThe answer: Border Reiver surnames", "{rule list: 3, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are estimated to be between 500 and 2,000 Bolivians in Newcastle, forming up to 1% of the population. This means that the smallest number of Bolivians estimated to live in Newcastle is 500.\nThe answer: 500", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are small but significant populations of Chinese, Jewish, and Eastern European individuals in Newcastle, and that Bolivians make up the largest percentage of any UK city. \nThe answer: up to 1%", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the name of the dialect, which is a concept related to language and not size, shape, age, or color. Rule 3 applies because the answer mentions the distinctive vocabulary and word pronunciations of the Geordie dialect, which are different concepts from other dialects. \nThe answer: Geordie", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule.\" Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"Anglo-Saxon populations\" came before \"Roman Imperial rule.\" \nThe answer: Anglo-Saxon populations", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule. This includes distinctive word pronunciations and vocabulary not used in other parts of the United Kingdom, as well as the pronunciation of certain words like \"dead\", \"cow\", \"house\" and \"strong\" in the way they were pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon language. Therefore, the answer is: distinctive word pronunciations and vocabulary.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"strang\" is more similar to \"strong\" than its antonym, so the answer must be related to \"strong\". \nThe answer: strong", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"words are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion between the modern English word \"burn\" and the Anglo-Saxon word for \"stream\". The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to infer that if \"burn\" means \"stream\" in Anglo-Saxon, then \"stream\" means \"burn\" in modern English. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" allows us to understand that the question is asking for the Anglo-Saxon word for \"burn\", not the modern English word. \nThe answer: \"burn\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that \"bairn\" and \"hyem\" are Geordie words with origins in Scandinavia is not relevant to the answer. However, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if \"bairn\" and \"hyem\" have origins in Scandinavia, then they have antonym origins from the Geordie culture. Therefore, the answer is Geordie. \nThe answer: Geordie.", "{3, 5, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rules state that location is important for the answer (rule 14), and that words and their origins are different concepts (rule 3). The answer is that some words from the Geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the Northern United Kingdom.", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts (4) and questions containing synonyms (7) are relevant because the question uses the Geordie words \"howay\" and \"hadaway\" to refer to \"come on\" and \"go away\", respectively. These words are likely used by people from the Northern United Kingdom, specifically in Newcastle and the surrounding area. The rule of negations being important for the answer (17) is also relevant because the question asks for the folks who are likely to use these words, implying that there are people who are unlikely to use them. \nThe answer: People from the Northern United Kingdom, specifically in Newcastle and the surrounding area.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"many words, however, appear to be used exclusively in Newcastle and the surrounding area,\" and then lists several examples of such words. This indicates that the answer is a list of words that are unique to Newcastle and its surrounding areas.\nThe answer: Canny, hacky, netty, hoy, hockle.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: \"hoy\" is a Geordie word with origins in Dutch, specifically from the word \"gooien\" via West Frisian.\nThe answer: Dutch", "{rule list: 13, 16, 22}\nExplanation: The Ear Institute at the University College London and Widex, a Danish hearing aid manufacturer, published a report in February of 2007.\nThe answer: a report", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question contains a synonym for \"noisiest\" which is \"most type of\". Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so \"noisiest\" cannot be interpreted as a size or shape. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so \"most type of\" can be interpreted as \"least quiet\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so \"least quiet\" should be negated to \"noisiest\".\nThe answer: Newcastle was named as the noisiest city in the UK.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is directly stated in the article as \"an average level of 80.4 decibels.\" Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that \"decibel level\" is a different concept from \"city.\" Rule 8 is relevant because it tells us that if the article had said another city had a higher decibel level than Newcastle, we would need to use the antonym of \"higher\" to determine that Newcastle had the lowest decibel level. \nThe answer: 80.4", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: negative long-term impact on health", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a motorway underpass without pedestrian access", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The Diamond Strip is a concentration of high-end bars on Collingwood Street. \"Referred to as\" is a synonym for \"called.\" \nThe answer: a concentration of high-end bars on Collingwood Street", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes \"The Gate\" as a new indoor complex consisting of bars, upmarket clubs, restaurants, and a 12-screen Empire multiplex cinema. This complex is located in the city centre. \nThe answer: a new indoor complex consisting of bars, upmarket clubs, restaurants, and a 12-screen Empire multiplex cinema.", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that \"The Gate\" is a new indoor complex consisting of bars, upmarket clubs, restaurants, and a 12-screen Empire multiplex cinema. We use rule 3 to determine that \"screens\" is a different concept from \"bars\" and \"clubs\", and rule 12 to ignore the irrelevant information about other areas for nightlife. \nThe answer: 12", "{rule list: 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Newcastle's gay scene - 'The Pink Triangle' - is centred on the Times Square area near the Centre for Life and has a range of bars, caf\u00e9s and clubs.\" Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any other options related to professions or nationalities. Rule 7 is relevant because it reminds us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"gay club scene\" in the passage. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to make sure we are looking for the name of the gay club scene, not what it is not called. \nThe answer: The Pink Triangle", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"color\" is a different concept from other concepts means that the answer cannot be \"pink.\" However, the rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" allows us to infer that \"range\" is a synonym for \"variety.\" \nThe answer: a variety of bars, caf\u00e9s, and clubs.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Newcastle has a proud history of theatre.\nThe answer: theatre", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who managed the original Theatre Royal in Newcastle, which is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" and rule 23 to understand that the subject of the sentence is in the active voice. The answer is Stephen Kemble. \nThe answer: Stephen Kemble", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: many celebrated seasons", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the date when the original Theatre Royal in Newcastle was opened. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the original theater must have been opened before it was replaced. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" which means that we should look for a sentence in the active voice that describes the opening of the theater. \nThe answer: January 21, 1788.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the original Theatre Royal was located on Mosley Street and was demolished to make way for Grey Street, where its replacement was built. Therefore, the answer is Grey Street.\nThe answer: Grey Street", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Newcastle still contains many theaters. Irrelevant information about specific theaters is also given, but the question only asks for a general category. \nThe answer: Theaters", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer is a thing that opened in 1837.\nThe answer: Theatre Royal", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a company that has been hosted at the Theatre Royal for over 25 years. The answer is \"Royal Shakespeare Company\".\nThe answer: Royal Shakespeare Company", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the size of the venues is not relevant to the answer. However, the names of the venues are important, so rule 13 applies. \nThe answer: local talent", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is relevant because the question asks about a title given to NewcastleGateshead, which is a location and not a profession or nationality. The rule that names are equally important for the answer is also relevant because the question specifically asks about the title given to NewcastleGateshead. \nThe answer: the arts capital of the UK", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept from other concepts eliminates any confusion about what \"largest\" refers to. The rule that names are equally important for the answer ensures that we correctly identify the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne as the answer.\nThe answer: The Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the music library contains 8000 CDs.\nThe answer: 8000", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The designers of Newcastle's library were John and Benjamin Green, and their last name is mentioned in the context. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb), as the sentence is in the passive voice and the designers are the subject. \nThe answer: Green", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the first public building in Newcastle to be lit by electric light, which implies that there were other buildings in Newcastle that were also lit by electric light. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine that the Lit and Phil was a public building. Additionally, we need to use rule 23 to understand that the Lit and Phil's lecture theatre was the first public building to be lit by electric light during a lecture by Joseph Swan on 20 October 1880.\nThe answer: the lecture theatre of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne (the Lit & Phil)", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Joseph Swan gave a lecture at the Lit and Phil on October 20, 1880, and that this lecture was the first public building to be lit by electric light.\nThe answer: Joseph Swan", "{rule list: locations are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question asks for a festival that takes place in Newcastle, so the location is important. The passage mentions several festivals, but only one takes place in April, which is the Newcastle Beer Festival.\nThe answer: Newcastle Beer Festival", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the timing of the Evolution Festival. The passage states that the festival takes place in May, specifically over the Spring bank holiday. Therefore, the answer is May.\nThe answer: May", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: biennially", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: EAT! NewcastleGateshead", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the festival mentioned in the passage and the duration of the festival. \nThe answer: 2 weeks", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from other concepts, so we can use this rule to identify the answer.\nThe answer: The Hoppings", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The Hoppings...takes place on Newcastle Town Moor every June.\" This means that the fair takes place in June. Additionally, since \"every June\" indicates a recurring event, we can infer that it takes place annually. \nThe answer: June", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Hoppings fair has its origins in the Temperance Movement during the early 1880s. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from movement, and rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Temperance Movement", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article lists several festivals that take place in Newcastle in different months. The question specifically asks about The Northern Rock Cyclone, which is described as a \"cycling festival.\" Therefore, the answer is: a cycling festival.", "{rule list: 4, 12, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the festival that is held in Newcastle's Gay Community and occurs in mid-July. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can't assume anything about the festival based on the location. Rule 12 is relevant because it tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can skip over the other festivals mentioned. Rule 13 is relevant because it tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the names of the festivals. Rule 20 is relevant because it tells us that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we can use this to identify the correct festival. \nThe answer: The Northern Pride Festival and Parade.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage describes various annual events held in Newcastle, but only one of them fits the description of a \"multicultural event\" held in \"late August.\" The passage states that the Newcastle Mela is a \"two-day multicultural event, blending drama, music and food from Punjabi, Pakistani, Bengali and Hindu cultures.\" \nThe answer: Newcastle Mela", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Sage Gateshead Music and Arts Centre", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a festival held in October in Newcastle. Rule 14 states that locations are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a festival in Newcastle.

Rule 2 applies because the article mentions that Venom is \"reckoned by many to be the originators of black metal.\" Rule 3 applies because the article mentions other bands and musicians that are not related to black metal. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for a band, not a nationality. Rule 7 applies because the question uses the synonym \"group\" instead of \"band.\" Rule 13 applies because the answer requires the specific name of a band. \nThe answer: Venom", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule about professions and nationalities being different concepts eliminates any confusion between the bands and the individuals mentioned in the passage. The rule about names being equally important for the answer tells us that the band name \"Skyclad\" is the relevant entity. The rule about shape, size, age, and color being different concepts is not relevant here. \nThe answer: Skyclad", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: Andy Taylor is a person and his profession is mentioned as lead guitarist. The question asks for the group he was a part of, which is a different concept from his nationality or gender. Therefore, rules 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), and 20 (he refers to male names) are relevant.\nThe answer: Duran Duran", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that the Pilgrim Street building was refurbished between November 2006 and May 2008. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that time is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 12 is relevant because it reminds us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, and we can ignore the information about the cinema relocating. \nThe answer: November 2006 and May 2008", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence states that \"during the refurbishment works, the cinema relocated to the Old Town Hall, Gateshead.\" This is a passive sentence, where the subject (the cinema) is acted upon (relocated) by the verb. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the cinema was relocated before it reopened in the Pilgrim Street building. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon by the verb. Therefore, the answer is: the cinema was relocated to the Old Town Hall, Gateshead.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the site currently houses three cinemas\". This means that there are three cinemas at the Pilgrim Street building.\nThe answer: Three cinemas.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Classic", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Tyneside Bar is located in a roof extension of the Pilgrim Street building, which was refurbished and now houses the Tyneside Cinema. The location of the Tyneside Bar is not relevant to the question, so rule 12 applies to exclude irrelevant information.\nThe answer: In a roof extension of the Pilgrim Street building.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Centre for Life", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage lists several museums and galleries in Newcastle, including the Discovery Museum, which is described as a museum highlighting life on Tyneside, including Tyneside's shipbuilding heritage, and inventions which changed the world.\nThe answer: Tyneside's shipbuilding heritage and inventions which changed the world.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Tyneside's shipbuilding heritage is mentioned in the article, which falls under the concept of \"heritage\" and \"profession\" (shipbuilding being a profession). Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are relevant.\nThe answer: shipbuilding", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"in 2009 the Newcastle on Tyne Museum of Antiquities merged with the Great North Museum (Hancock Museum).\" This is a clear statement of a past event, and the sentence is in the active voice, indicating that the subject (Newcastle on Tyne Museum of Antiquities) performed the action (merged) on the object (Great North Museum). Therefore, rules 16 and 23 are relevant.\nThe answer: 2009", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage lists several museums and galleries in Newcastle, and the question specifically asks for the one that is dedicated to children's books.

The team is a basketball team, which is a sport played by humans and not animals or vehicles.\nThe answer: Newcastle Eagles", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the question is asking for the name of a team implies that it is a different concept from the city of Newcastle. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about horse racing and greyhound racing. \nThe answer: Newcastle Diamonds", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Newcastle Diamonds speedway team is based at Brough Park in Byker, a venue that is also home to greyhound racing.\nThe answer: Brough Park in Byker", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Blaydon Race", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Newcastle International Airport is located approximately 6 miles (9.7 km) from the city centre. \nThe answer: approximately 6 miles (9.7 km)", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the airport is connected to the city via the Metro Light Rail system, and a journey into Newcastle city centre takes approximately 20 minutes. This indicates that the airport is connected to the city by a rail system.

This can be answered by identifying the train operator mentioned in the passage that serves Yorkshire. \nThe answer: CrossCountry trains", "{rule list: 4, 6}\nExplanation: Virgin Trains East Coast provides half-hourly trains to London King's Cross and CrossCountry trains serve destinations in Yorkshire, the Midlands and the South West. First TransPennine Express operates services to Manchester and Liverpool. Therefore, Northern Rail provides local and regional services.\nThe answer: Northern Rail", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Tyne and Wear Metro, which is a system of suburban and underground railways covering much of Tyne and Wear. The use of the word \"underground\" indicates that the railways are located beneath the surface.

The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence \"A bridge was built across the Tyne, between Newcastle and Gateshead, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981\" is in the passive voice, and therefore Queen Elizabeth II opened a bridge across the Tyne.\nThe answer: a bridge across the Tyne", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, animals and vehicles are different concepts, and first comes before last and last comes after first.

Rule 3 applies because the transition to smart ticketing is a different concept from the physical changes to the machines and gates.\nThe answer: smart ticketing", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that \"tracks, signalling and overhead wires are also being overhauled.\" This refers to the infrastructure of the Metro system and falls under the concept of \"tracks\" as per rule 3 and not \"vehicles\" as per rule 5.\nThe answer: tracks, signalling and overhead wires", "{3, 5, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are not relevant to the answer. The passage mentions the refurbishment and modernization of Newcastle's train system, including the replacement of ticket machines, introduction of ticket gates, complete refurbishment of trains, improvement works at stations, and overhauling of tracks, signalling, and overhead wires. The longer term plans include the procurement of an entirely new fleet of trains and further extensions to the system, including proposed routes to Newcastle's west end, the Cobalt business park in North Tyneside, the Metrocentre in Gateshead, and additional locations in Gateshead, South Tyneside, and Sunderland. Several of the proposed routes would require trams as opposed to the current light rail trains.\nThe answer: An entirely new fleet of trains and further extensions to the system, including proposed routes to Newcastle's west end, the Cobalt business park in North Tyneside, the Metrocentre in Gateshead, and additional locations in Gateshead, South Tyneside, and Sunderland.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that some of the proposed routes would require trams instead of the current light rail trains, indicating that trams are a different type of train than the current ones being used.\nThe answer: trams", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" helps us identify that the question is asking for a road in Newcastle. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" helps us understand that the question is asking for a road that stretches from north to south. \nThe answer: A1 (Gateshead Newcastle Western Bypass)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article lists several major roads in the Newcastle area, including the A69, which heads west to Carlisle.\nThe answer: A69", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the nickname of a road in Newcastle, which is the A167.

This indicates that Nexus is a location-based coordinating body, falling under rule 14. Additionally, since Nexus is not a profession or nationality, rule 4 applies. \nThe answer: a coordinating body for bus services", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer.

The relevant rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we need to look for synonyms of \"streets\" in the passage. The relevant rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative words in the passage. The answer: The passage states that contraflows are to be implemented on \"one way streets,\" so the answer is \"none,\" as contraflows are implemented on streets that are currently one-way.", "{rule list: 14, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for what the local council of Newcastle would like to link their local bike networks to. The relevant information can be found in the last sentence of the article, which mentions the council's objective to \"link the local networks to national networks.\" This answer is supported by rule 14, which states that locations are equally important for the answer, and rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: national networks", "{rule list: 4, 6}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the company running the service is irrelevant. The rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so any mention of animals in the passage can be ignored.\nThe answer: Danish DFDS Seaways", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The DFDS ferry service to Sweden ceased operation.\nThe answer: end of October 2006", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: high fuel prices and new competition from low-cost air services", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the termination of the service to Norway is a decrease in service, which is a form of \"less\" compared to the previous situation.

Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, but in this case, it can be applied to schools and their funding. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can count the number of independent schools mentioned in the article and provide that as the answer.\nThe answer: Seven.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article lists several schools in Newcastle, including co-ed and single-sex independent schools. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant here, but the rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant in identifying the largest co-ed independent school as the Royal Grammar School, which is listed before the other independent schools. \nThe answer: Royal Grammar School.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Newcastle College", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: St Cuthbert's High School is a state-Catholic run high school, indicating that it is dominated by the Catholic religion.\nThe answer: Catholic", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: We need to identify the number of universities in Newcastle. Rule 3 tells us that size and quantity are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the article mentions the number explicitly. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can't assume that the article mentions the number in terms of the nationality of the universities. Therefore, we need to look for explicit mentions of the universities. The article states that \"the city has two universities\", so the answer is 2.\nThe answer: 2", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that first comes before last.

Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about the origins of the universities. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negation in the phrase \"voted 'Best New University'\".

The Grill Room was designed by Sir Edward Poynter.\nThe answer: Sir Edward Poynter", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a person's name and when they were brought in to work on the museum. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that \"Captain Francis Fowke\" came before the person we are looking for. Rule 23 states that passive sentences have the subject being acted upon the verb, so we can identify \"Captain Francis Fowke\" as the subject of the passive sentence \"With the death of Captain Francis Fowke...\". Therefore, the answer is \"Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott\".", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the School for Naval Architects, now known as the Henry Cole Wing, was designed by Colonel Henry Young Darracott Scott and his assistant J.W. Wild. Therefore, the previous name of the Henry Cole Wing was the School for Naval Architects.\nThe answer: School for Naval Architects", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The question asks for the type of stone used for the staircase designed by J.W. Wild, which is a specific detail mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: Cadeby stone", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Henry Cole Wing now houses the prints and architectural drawings of the V&A and the RIBA Drawings and Archives Collections, as well as the Sackler Centre for arts education. \nThe answer: prints and architectural drawings", "{rule list: 16, 22, 12}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the Sackler Centre for arts education opened in 2008. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), 22 (if two entities are listed, then \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last), and 12 (some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer).\nThe answer: 2008", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sgraffito", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Starkie Gardner", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the location of the two Cast Courts as \"to the southeast of the garden.\" This indicates that they are located on the southeastern side of the building.\nThe answer: southeastern side", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the design and construction of various parts of the museum, including the sculpture gallery, which was built on the south side of the garden between 1877 and 1883. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including the location of the sculpture gallery and the other parts of the museum. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes the order of spatial relationships, indicating that the sculpture gallery is located on the south side of the garden. \nThe answer: on the south side of the garden", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Reuben Townroe designed the exterior mosaic panels in the parapet and the plaster work in the library, while Sir John Taylor designed the book shelves and cases. Therefore, the answer is Reuben Townroe.\nThe answer: Reuben Townroe", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the main fa\u00e7ade was designed by Aston Webb after winning a competition in 1891 to extend the museum. Therefore, the answer is Aston Webb.\nThe answer: Aston Webb", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The main fa\u00e7ade, built from red brick and Portland stone, stretches 720 feet (220 m) along Cromwell Gardens.\" This sentence explicitly states that the main fa\u00e7ade was built from red brick and Portland stone.\nThe answer: red brick and Portland stone", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The length of the main fa\u00e7ade is given as 720 feet (220 m) along Cromwell Gardens. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from shape, so the length of the fa\u00e7ade is not the same as its shape. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so the length of the fa\u00e7ade is the first piece of information given about it.\nThe answer: 720 feet (220 m)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. The question asks for a late Gothic architectural sculptural feature, which is the antonym of Classical. The passage describes the tower above the main entrance as having an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame, which is a feature of late Gothic architecture. Therefore, the answer is an open work crown. \nThe answer: Open work crown", "{rule list: 3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the tower above the main entrance of the museum, which has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame. The top row of windows in the tower are interspersed with statues of many of the British artists whose work is displayed in the museum. The answer is: the top row of windows. \nThe answer: the top row of windows.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Prince Albert was sculpted by Alfred Drury and Queen Victoria was sculpted above the frame around the arches and entrance. Therefore, the answer is Alfred Drury. \nThe answer: Alfred Drury", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the fa\u00e7ades surround \"four levels of galleries.\"\nThe answer: four", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Webb", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about the type of building material being referred to. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" helps us understand that if the galleries were originally white with restrained classical detail and mouldings, then the entrance hall and flanking staircases must have predominantly used marble. \nThe answer: marble", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the question asks about a British monarch means that the answer is about their nationality, not their profession. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Prince Albert appears above the twin entrances and Queen Victoria appears above the frame around the arches and entrance. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we know that Queen Victoria is a female monarch. \nThe answer: Queen Victoria", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967.\" This indicates that the Art Library received the first major post-war work.\nThe answer: Art Library", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Henry Cole wing", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a new entrance building", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house. This indicates that the former boiler house was repurposed for a new entrance building.\nThe answer: a new entrance building", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Indian, Japanese, Chinese, iron work, the main glass galleries and the main silverware gallery were redesigned in the 1990s. The main silverware gallery was further enhanced in 2002. \nThe answer: The main silverware gallery", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the restoration of the mosaic floors in the sculpture gallery during the 2006 renovation.\nThe answer: mosaic floors", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: FuturePlan", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the tunnel to the subway leading to South Kensington tube station\" was redesigned in 2004 as part of the museum's \"FuturePlan\" project. This indicates that the subway tunnel from the museum leads to South Kensington tube station.\nThe answer: South Kensington tube station", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps to determine the order of events, and the rule 22 helps to identify the entity referred to by \"new Medieval and Renaissance galleries\". \nThe answer: McInnes Usher McKnight Architects (MUMA)", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The central garden was redesigned by Kim Wilkie.\" This sentence directly answers the question.\nThe answer: Kim Wilkie", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the John Madejski Garden", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The shape of the water feature is a subtle blend of traditional and modern, and it is elliptical.\nThe answer: elliptical", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the water feature has steps around the edge is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the steps can be drained for receptions and gatherings, then they can also be filled with water for decorative purposes. \nThe answer: receptions, gatherings, or exhibition purposes.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the design of the John Madejski Garden, including the planting of American Sweetgum trees in the two corners by the north facade. Rule 3 states that color, shape, age, and profession are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context may be irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is relevant for identifying the location of the trees. \nThe answer: American Sweetgum trees", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the year mentioned in the passage. Rule 16 helps to determine the order of events, and rule 22 clarifies that \"the new gallery\" refers to the permanent gallery mentioned in the question. \nThe answer: 2004", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of an institution that partnered with the V&A to open the first permanent architectural history gallery in the UK. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we know that the answer will not be a profession or a nationality. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we know that the answer will be the name of an institution. \nThe answer: Royal Institute of British Architects", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the V&A holds \"over 600,000 drawings\" in its collection.\nThe answer: over 600,000", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the RIBA Drawings and Archives Collection has been transferred to the museum\" when the new gallery opened. This means that the collection of drawings and archives from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) was transferred to the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A). \nThe answer: RIBA Drawings and Archives Collection", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The V&A holds over 700,000 photographs from around the world in its architectural collection.\nThe answer: over 700,000", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the RIBA's holdings of over 330 drawings by Andrea Palladio are the largest in the world. This means that the RIBA's drawing collection of Andrea Palladio is considered the largest in the world.\nThe answer: Andrea Palladio", "{rule list: 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rules state that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, and \"his\" refers to male names and \"her\" refers to female names. Therefore, we can identify the lone female architect listed above and determine if she is represented in the collection.\nThe answer: Zaha Hadid", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to the question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is not relevant either. The answer can be found in the passage: \"The RIBA's holdings of over 330 drawings by Andrea Palladio are the largest in the world.\" Therefore, the answer is 330.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for a specific architect. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because it does not apply to the question. \nThe answer: Sir Christopher Wren", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage lists a number of British and European architects whose drawings are held in the RIBA collection. The question asks for an architect famous for the India Gate in New Delhi, which is located in India and therefore not listed in the passage. However, the question does not specify that the architect must be British or European, so rule 13 (names are equally important for the answer) allows us to look for any architect, regardless of nationality. The answer is therefore not explicitly stated in the passage, but it is Edwin Lutyens, who designed the India Gate and is listed among the British architects whose drawings are held in the RIBA collection. \nThe answer: Edwin Lutyens", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Bishopsgate", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Sir Paul Pindar's house is a rare survivor of the Great Fire of London, which occurred in the 17th century. \nThe answer: the Great Fire of London", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the collection of period rooms and parts of buildings, including the two top stories of the facade of Sir Paul Pindar's house dated c1600. This means that the house is dated around the year 1600. \nThe answer: c1600", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the chateau of Montal", "{rule list: 3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a column from the Alhambra, which is a Moorish palace and fortress complex in Granada, Spain. Therefore, the answer is \"the Alhambra\". \nThe answer: the Alhambra", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the V&A holds over 19,000 items from the Islamic world.\nThe answer: over 19,000", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 and 22. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art was opened after the V&A had already acquired its collection of Islamic art. Rule 22 establishes that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last entity, which means that the Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art is the latter entity. Therefore, the answer is: 2006.", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the centerpiece of the Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art, which is mentioned in the passage as the highlight of the gallery. Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that \"highlight\" means the most important or significant item. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as size, shape, and age, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Ardabil Carpet", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks about a specific location. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" is also relevant because the question uses the word \"country\" as a synonym for \"region.\" Finally, the rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art is named in the context paragraph. \nThe answer: Spain", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The Salting Bequest was made in 1909.\nThe answer: 1909.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the museum's collections of South and South-East Asian art comprise nearly 60,000 objects.\nThe answer: nearly 60,000 objects", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the museum's collections of South and South-East Asian art comprise nearly 60,000 objects, including about 10,000 textiles. Therefore, the answer is 10,000. \nThe answer: 10,000", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of paintings is not related to their size, shape, age, or color. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about textiles and sculptures. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. The answer: Not specified in the article.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that \"opened\" refers to the year the gallery was inaugurated. The rule 22 helps us understand that \"former\" refers to the Jawaharlal Nehru gallery of Indian art and \"latter\" is not applicable in this context. \nThe answer: 1991", "{13, 20}\nExplanation: The Jawaharlal Nehru gallery of Indian art is named after Jawaharlal Nehru.\nThe answer: Jawaharlal Nehru", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from nationality or profession, and the passage mentions the number of works of art in the collection.\nThe answer: more than 70,000", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"nationality and profession are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question, as it is asking about countries, not nationalities. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also not relevant. The answer is simply: China, Japan, and Korea. \nThe answer: China, Japan, and Korea.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: T. T. Tsui Gallery of Chinese art", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the year the gallery opened, which is a comparison of before and after it opened. Rule 16 applies because the year is a chronological detail. \nThe answer: 1991", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from size, shape, and color is not relevant to this question. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is also not relevant. However, the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A is relevant because the question asks for the two dynasties that most of the Chinese works of art in the Far Eastern collections date from. Therefore, the answer is: Ming and Qing.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the company that the gallery of Japanese art is named after, which is a specific piece of information that can be found in the passage. Rule 3 applies to clarify that the company name is not a concept related to size, shape, age, or color. Rule 13 applies to emphasize that names are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Toshiba", "{rule list: first comes before last and last comes after first}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Toshiba gallery of Japanese art opened in December 1986.\"\nThe answer: December 1986", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the sculpture of Amida Nyorai is one of the oldest pieces displayed in the Toshiba gallery of Japanese art, and that the majority of exhibits date from 1550 to 1900. Therefore, the sculpture is likely to be from a century before 1550, which is the 14th century.\nThe answer: 13th century", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the majority of exhibits in the Toshiba gallery of Japanese art date from 1550 to 1900, indicating a specific time period. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts eliminates any confusion about the meaning of \"majority\" in this context. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B, allows us to understand that the objects not included in the majority are likely from other time periods. \nThe answer: 1550 to 1900", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the material of the incense burner cannot be inferred from the passage. The rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: bronze", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because the question asks about a specific period of Tibetan art represented in the collection. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" is relevant because the passage uses passive voice to describe the Tibetan art. \nThe answer: 14th to the 19th century", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions art from various South Asian countries, including Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. The answer is Sri Lanka.\nThe answer: Sri Lanka", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and color are different concepts is not relevant to the question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The question asks about \"religious art objects\" from Thailand, Burma, Cambodia that reflect the influence of India. The passage mentions \"refined Hindu and Buddhist sculptures\" that reflect the influence of India, and also mentions art from Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka in various materials. Therefore, the answer is likely to be found in the sentence that mentions art from these countries. The answer is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the refined Hindu and Buddhist sculptures mentioned earlier in the passage are the religious art objects from Thailand, Burma, and Cambodia that reflect the influence of India. \nThe answer: Hindu and Buddhist sculptures", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We apply rule 3 to determine that \"inlaid with mother-of-pearl\" refers to the material used to decorate the Korean boxes, not their shape or color. We also apply rule 8 to determine that \"inlaid with\" means the same as \"decorated with\". \nThe answer: mother-of-pearl", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We can ignore the information about Korean and Himalayan art, as well as the mention of gold, silver, stone, terracotta, and ivory in the displays from Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. We only need to focus on the mention of combs, which are made of ivory according to the passage.\nThe answer: ivory", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Codex Forster is a collection of notebooks by Leonardo da Vinci. \nThe answer: Leonardo da Vinci", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Forster I, Forster II, and Forster III", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the information about Alexander Dyce's bequest comes after the information about the Codex Forster. Rule 22 establishes that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\", which means that the number of books bequeathed by Alexander Dyce is the second number mentioned in the text. \nThe answer: over 14,000 books", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Alexander Dyce is a person mentioned in the article who left books to the museum. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because the sentence mentions John Forster first and Alexander Dyce second. The rule that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\" is also relevant because it clarifies which person's bequest is being referred to. \nThe answer: 1869", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that John Forster bequeathed his collection of books to the museum in 1876. This is a straightforward answer that can be found by identifying the name and action of the person in the sentence.\nThe answer: 1876", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a Victorian author whose papers are collected in the library. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a specific name. The answer: William Morris.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a writer whose papers are collected in the museum. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that the writer is English.

Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the mention of archival material and the Victoria and Albert Museum's computer system can be ignored. First comes before last and last comes after first, so the timeframe of the cataloging system used is between the 1980s and the 1990s. \nThe answer: MODES cataloging system", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"All of the archival material at the National Art Library is using Encoded Archival Description (EAD).\" This indicates that EAD is the archival system used for all material at the library.\nThe answer: Encoded Archival Description (EAD)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer.

Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so any information about the size of the images is irrelevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"approximately how many images were digitized during the first year of the Factory Project?\" The answer is \"15,000\". \nThe answer: 15,000", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: cataloging everything", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks about who purchased or commissioned the works of European artists included in the British galleries of the V&A.

Rule 3 tells us that color, age, shape, and profession are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the names listed in the passage. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for an artist who had a major influence on the Gothic Revival, not just any artist. \nThe answer: Horace Walpole.", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The article mentions that imports from Asia, including porcelain, cloth, and wallpaper, are on display in the V&A's British galleries. This indicates that works of different types from Asia are included in the galleries.\nThe answer: porcelain, cloth, and wallpaper", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies\" during the Georgian age. This answer is found by applying rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 7, which allows for synonyms to be used in the question. \nThe answer: The increase in tea drinking.", "{3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the Georgian age emphasized entertainment and leisure, which led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. This is a trend in British culture that is linked to design during the same period.\nThe answer: The trend of increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure.", "{4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to the question asks for a specific person, so rule 4 is relevant to ensure that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 16 is relevant to ensure that the first and last parts of the passage are correctly identified. Rule 17 is relevant to ensure that negations are taken into account. \nThe answer: John Ruskin", "{3, 4, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks about the influence of the Industrial Revolution on the entrepreneurs Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton, and Eleanor Coade. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers related to those concepts. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers related to nationality. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What manufacturing process did Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton, and Eleanor Coade adopt during the Industrial Revolution?\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can list the entrepreneurs in the order they are mentioned in the passage: Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton, and Eleanor Coade. \nThe answer: mass production", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for an artistic movement that was a reaction against industrialization. Rule 3 tells us that design and art are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers that refer to design movements.

Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from shape, so we can ignore any information about the size or shape of the item.

The passage states that the Chancel Chapel from Santa Chiara Florence is the largest item from Italy in the collection and is dated 1493-1500, so the answer is the Late 15th to Early 16th century. \nThe answer: Late 15th to Early 16th century.", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The article states that the museum collection includes more than 20 works by Rodin, which is the most out of any other French sculptor.

Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What is the age range of the textiles in the museum's collection?\" \nThe answer: 1st century AD to the present", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the collection includes textiles from all populated continents, but also specifies that the collection is mainly western European. Therefore, the answer is western Europe.\nThe answer: western Europe", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are also not relevant. Animals and vehicles are not relevant. The relevant rule is that if entities are listed, \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last. Therefore, the answer is by technique.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the oldest known surviving European tapestry in the V&A collection is a fragment of the Cloth of St Gereon. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that the age of the tapestry is what makes it significant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first tapestry mentioned in the article is the oldest. \nThe answer: a fragment of the Cloth of St Gereon", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 15th century", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Devonshire Hunting Tapestries are rare and unique due to their size is important information. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the information about the Devonshire Hunting Tapestries comes before the information about other tapestries. Therefore, the answer is: the Netherlands.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Devonshire Hunting Tapestries depict the hunting of various animals, and they are unique not just in their age but also in their size.\nThe answer: hunting of various animals", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts helps us identify that we are looking for a workshop, not a person. The rule that names are equally important for the answer tells us that we need to look for a specific workshop name. \nThe answer: John Vanderbank's workshop", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Sicilian Tristan Quilt is \"one of the earliest surviving examples of European quilting\" and that it dates back to the \"late 14th-century.\" Therefore, we can use rule 3 to understand that \"late 14th-century\" refers to the age of the quilt, and rule 16 to understand that \"late\" comes after \"early\" and \"14th-century\" refers to the century in which it was made.\nThe answer: late 14th-century", "{rule list: names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the V&A collection includes \"The Forest\" tapestry of 1887, which was designed by William Morris.\nThe answer: William Morris", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1887", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for an American artist who worked in the Art Deco period of textiles. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the artist is American is irrelevant to their profession. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a specific artist mentioned in the article. The only artist mentioned is Marion Dorn, who designed rugs and fabrics during the Art Deco period. \nThe answer: Marion Dorn.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a rug designed by Serge Chermayeff, who was a Russian-born British designer. \nThe answer: Serge Chermayeff", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" tells us that the name \"Theatre Museum\" is important for the answer. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" tells us that the word \"former\" is not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Theatre Museum", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year in which the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries opened. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more recent than B, then B is less recent than A. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: March 2009", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The V&A Theatre & Performance galleries hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment.\nThe answer: collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from other concepts means that the time period in which the playwright lived is important. The rule that first comes before last means that the playwright must have lived before the time period covered by the collection. \nThe answer: Shakespeare's day", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The V&A theatre collection is available for research, exhibitions, and other shows.\nThe answer: research, exhibitions, and other shows.", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Conservation is responsible for the long-term preservation of the collections, and covers all the collections held by the V&A and the V&A Museum of Childhood.\" This indicates that the area responsible for the long-term preservation of the V&A collections is conservation.\nThe answer: Conservation", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the conservators control the museum environment, specifically the temperature and light, as part of their \"preventive\" conservation work. \nThe answer: temperature and light", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage describes two major categories of conservation: \"preventive\" and \"interventive.\" The latter involves cleaning and reintegration to reveal original surface decoration and restore shape, resulting in an object that is more stable, attractive, and comprehensible to the viewer. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as shape and color, which are different from each other. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as profession and nationality, which are also different from each other. \nThe answer: Interventive conservation", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: V&A Museum of Childhood", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: \"Preventive\" conservation includes providing advice on the handling of items. Rule 1 applies because \"preventive\" conservation is a type of conservation that aims to reduce the risk of damaging objects. Rule 3 applies because \"preventive\" conservation and \"interventive\" conservation are different concepts. Rule 7 applies because \"providing advice on the handling of items\" is a synonym for \"advising on correct packaging, mounting and handling procedures during movement and display.\" \nThe answer: Preventive conservation", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that ABC is an American commercial broadcast television network does not indicate its ownership. Therefore, we need to use rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer. The answer is The Walt Disney Company. \nThe answer: The Walt Disney Company.", "{rule list: 10, 12}\nExplanation: The year when ABC stylized its logo is being asked.

The answer can be found by applying the rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and that Disney-ABC Television Group is a subsidiary of the Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company.\nThe answer: Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that \"ABC originally launched on October 12, 1943 as a radio network.\" This means that ABC first started as a radio network on October 12, 1943.\nThe answer: October 12, 1943", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: ABC originally launched as a radio network, separated from and serving as the successor to the NBC Blue Network. \nThe answer: radio network", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: ABC extended its operations to television in 1948.\nThe answer: 1948", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Profession and ownership are different concepts, so rule 4 applies to distinguish between ABC's ownership of ESPN and ESPN's profession as a sports channel. Rule 16 applies to determine that the purchase of ESPN occurred after the merger with United Paramount Theatres. \nThe answer: ESPN", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The question asks about a company that merged with ABC's parent company in the 1980s. The article states that ABC's parent company merged with Capital Cities Communications, so the answer is Capital Cities Communications.", "{3, 12, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about the number of stations is not related to the question.

Therefore, the answer is not found in the passage.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that the event happened after 2007. The rule 23 helps us understand that the sentence is in the active voice, and the subject is Citadel Broadcasting. \nThe answer: Citadel Broadcasting.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the television network has eight owned-and-operated stations, so we use rule 16 to prioritize this information over the number of affiliated stations. \nThe answer: 8", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity in Canada that handles substitution regulations for television shows, which is a negation question. Therefore, rule 17 applies. Additionally, the question mentions \"substitution regulations for television shows,\" which is a specific concept related to television broadcasting, so rule 3 applies. The answer is the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. \n\nThe answer: Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer must be a company that owns radio stations and purchased ABC Radio properties in 2007. Therefore, we need to apply rule 4 to distinguish between profession and company, and rule 16 to determine that the company comes after the subject. \nThe answer: Citadel Broadcasting", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that RCA is an electronics manufacturer is not relevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that NBC was owned by Radio Corporation of America (RCA). \nThe answer: Radio Corporation of America (RCA)", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question, but the rule that differentiates between concepts of size, shape, age, and color and concepts of profession and nationality is relevant. The answer is NBC Blue and NBC Red, which are two radio networks owned by RCA. \nThe answer: NBC Blue and NBC Red", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: NBC Red served major cities.\nThe answer: major cities.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that NBC Red served major cities and that the purpose of NBC Blue was to test new programs on markets of lesser importance. Therefore, it can be inferred that NBC Red tested programs that were already established and successful. Additionally, the passage does not provide any information about the specific type of programs that were tested. \nThe answer: The passage does not provide information about the specific type of programs that NBC Red tested.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that NBC Blue was created for the primary purpose of testing new programs. This indicates that NBC Blue was the network tasked with testing new programs.\nThe answer: NBC Blue", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Mutual", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so the year mentioned in the question is not the same as other concepts in the passage. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so we know that the year mentioned in the question comes before the information about the FCC report. Rule 23 states that the subject of a passive sentence is acted upon the verb, so we can identify the passive sentence \"The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue\" and determine that the FCC did not give the recommendation, but rather the report did. \nThe answer: 1938", "{3, 12, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates the concepts of time and events from physical attributes like size and shape. Rule 12 allows us to ignore irrelevant information in the passage. Rule 23 helps us understand that the FCC was the object of the action in the sentence. \nThe answer: 1940", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The article mentions that in the 1940s, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that size is a different concept from profession or nationality. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 8 is relevant because it tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article mentions that the FCC recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue, implying that NBC Red was more dominant than NBC Blue. Therefore, we can infer that NBC Blue was less dominant than NBC Red. \nThe answer: NBC Red Network", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 8 (antonyms), and 17 (negations). The question asks for the network that RCA was using to eliminate competition, implying that RCA was using one of its networks to do so. The passage states that the FCC recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue, and that RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate competition. Therefore, the answer is NBC Blue.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Mark Woods", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that \"converted into an independent subsidiary\" means that the network was separated from its parent company. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that \"network\" and \"subsidiary\" are different concepts. \nThe answer: NBC Blue Network", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. Rule 4, which states that profession and investment are different concepts, is relevant. Rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first, is also relevant. The answer is Dillon, Read & Co.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the person who held a specific position in a specific year. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a nationality. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer must be the first person mentioned in the article who held the position of RCA president. \nThe answer: David Sarnoff", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of money offered by Dillon, Read & Co for NBC Blue. This information is directly stated in the passage. Rule 3 applies because the amount of money is a numerical concept. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the amount offered, which is the opposite of the amount rejected. \nThe answer: $7.5 million", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that Edward John Noble was the owner of Life Savers candy.\nThe answer: Life Savers", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific date, which can be found in the passage as \"The Commission authorized the transaction on October 12, 1943.\"\nThe answer: October 12, 1943.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the person or entity from whom Noble acquired the rights to the American Broadcasting Company name. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so knowing the nationality of the person is not relevant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the name by looking for the last name mentioned in the passage. The answer: George B. Storer.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: We can use rule 3 to determine that \"position\" refers to a job or role, and not a physical location. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can assume that \"position\" does not refer to Woods' nationality. Finally, rule 16 tells us that \"subsequently\" means after a certain point in time, so we can infer that Woods' promotion to vice-chairman of the board came after his time as president and CEO. \nThe answer: vice-chairman of the board", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Mark Woods left ABC on June 30, 1951, which is a specific date mentioned at the end of the paragraph.\nThe answer: June 30, 1951.", "{3, 8, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.

This is a comparison between the past (when ABC needed to hold interests in other countries) and the present (when satellite television made it unnecessary). The use of \"ended\" implies a complete cessation of the need. Additionally, the question uses the word \"need,\" which is the opposite of \"not necessary.\" \nThe answer: satellite television", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: ABC sold all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.

This is an example of rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the low-band VHF frequencies are the opposite of the high-band VHF frequencies, and Marx believed that the low-band frequencies would be taken by the Army, leaving the high-band frequencies for broadcasting. \nThe answer: channels 2 through 6", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: ABC submitted licenses for 5 television stations in 1947.\nThe answer: 1947", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that ABC submitted five applications for television station licenses, one for each market where it owned and operated a radio station, and that all of these applications requested for the stations to broadcast on VHF channel 7.

So, we can say that CBS and NBC had more coverage than ABC, and ABC had less coverage than CBS and NBC. \nThe answer: CBS and NBC", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the entity that forced UPT to become independent, which is the opposite of UPT being forced. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the year in which UPT was forced to become independent, which is a chronological order. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the subject of the action, which is the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe answer: the U.S. Supreme Court", "{rule list: 1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: UPT was forced to become an independent entity, separating itself from Paramount Pictures.\nThe answer: Paramount Pictures", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1949, ABC had only nine full-time affiliates.\nThe answer: 9", "{rule list: 3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a rumor about ABC being sold to another network, which implies a negation.

Rule 3 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so \"network\" and \"company\" are not interchangeable. \nThe answer: CBS", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Prudential Insurance Company of America", "{1, 16, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), and 13 (names are equally important for the answer). The answer is Leonard Goldenson. \nThe answer: Leonard Goldenson", "{rule list: 4, 10, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the founder of CBS, which is a specific entity. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the founder is a professional in the media industry is irrelevant. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant, so the misspelling of \"founder\" does not affect the answer. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important, so the fact that the question asks for the founder of CBS means that the answer should not be about any other person or entity. \nThe answer: William S. Paley", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the approval date of the agreement to acquire ABC by UPT's board, which is a specific event in the past. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the approval happened before any subsequent events mentioned in the passage. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", so we need to look for an active sentence that mentions the approval. The sentence \"On June 6, 1951, the tentative agreement was approved by UPT's board of directors\" fits both rules and provides the answer.\nThe answer: June 6, 1951", "{rule list: 10, 11, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific date, which is not mentioned in the article. Therefore, we need to use context clues to infer the answer. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can assume that \"6th\" and \"Sixth\" refer to the same thing. Rule 11 states that contractions in the question are irrelevant, so we can assume that \"FCC's\" and \"Federal Communications Commission's\" refer to the same thing. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: 1952", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes the FCC's approval of UPT's purchase of ABC, which is an action taken by the FCC, making it a passive sentence. Therefore, rule 23 applies. The passage also provides a specific date, February 9, 1953, which is a chronological order, making rule 16 applicable.\nThe answer: February 9, 1953", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these should not be confused with the name of the merged company. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the name of the merged company should come after the mention of UPT and ABC separately. \nThe answer: American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that location is important for the answer and the rule that \"headquartered\" implies a location.\nThe answer: The Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: August 10, 1948", "{rule list: 16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"In October 1948, as a result of an influx of television station license applications that it had issued as well as a study it undertook on the use of the VHF spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the FCC implemented a freeze on new station applications.\" This is a passive sentence, so we need to identify the subject (FCC) and the verb (implemented) to determine that the FCC froze incoming applications for new stations in October 1948.\nThe answer: October 1948", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of ABC's transmitter for its affiliate station in San Francisco. Rule 3 states that locations are important for the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the information about the San Francisco station comes after the information about the other stations. \nThe answer: Mount Wilson", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"On May 7, 1949, Billboard revealed that ABC had proposed an investment of $6.25 million, of which it would spend $2.5 million to convert 20 acres (80,937 m2) of land in Hollywood into what would become The Prospect Studios.\" Rule 3 applies because \"land in Hollywood\" refers to a location, not a shape or size. Rule 16 applies because \"what studio\" refers to a profession or establishment. \nThe answer: The Prospect Studios", "{rule list: 8, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: ABC premiered The Flintstones on September 30, 1960.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1960s", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that The Flintstones was created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.\nThe answer: William Hanna and Joseph Barbera", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that in the 1960s, ABC began to counterprogram its competitors by airing family-oriented series. \nThe answer: The 1960s", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"In 1959, Walt Disney Productions, having improved its financial situation, had purchased ABC's shares in the Disneyland theme park for $7.5 million.\" Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the percent lower, which is the opposite of the percent higher that Dell was offering. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific year. \nThe answer: 1959", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: ABC could not counter the offer because they did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in color, so their first television collaboration with Disney ended. The question asks for the network that approached Walt Disney, so we use rule 4 to understand that profession and network are different concepts, and rule 17 to understand that negations in the question are important. The answer is NBC. \n\nThe answer: NBC", "{16, 17, 22}\nExplanation: We need to identify when ABC and Disney's television collaboration ended. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the end of the collaboration came after the beginning. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the wording of the passage. Rule 22 tells us that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so we need to identify which entity came first and which came last. \nThe answer: The collaboration ended in 1961.", "{16, 22}\nExplanation: \"the network would resume its relationship with Disney in 1985\" - \"the network\" refers to ABC, and \"resume\" implies that there was a previous relationship. Therefore, the answer is 1985.\nThe answer: 1985", "{rule list: 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about an internet-based campaign launched by ABC in 2000. The relevant information is that the campaign was focused on ABC's circle logo, also known as \"the dot\", and involved a program called \"download the dot\" that caused the logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner. The answer is: ABC's circle logo. \nThe answer: ABC's circle logo.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) is relevant because it helps us understand that the question is asking for a person or group of people who were hired to produce ABC's identity, not a specific nationality. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" (13) is also relevant because it tells us that we need to look for a specific group or company name. \nThe answer: Troika Design Group", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The rule states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession. Therefore, the color of the 2001 ABC logo can be determined independently of other characteristics mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: black-and-yellow", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"the dot\"", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Pittard Sullivan", "{7, 10, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that ABC stopped using its 1998-2002 four-note jingles for promotions in the fall of 2015. Rule 7 is relevant because the question uses the word \"jingle\" as a synonym for \"theme tune.\" Rule 10 is relevant because the question contains a contraction (\"it's\") that should be expanded to \"its\" for clarity. Rule 16 is relevant because the question asks for the year in which ABC stopped using the jingle, which implies a chronological order. \nThe answer: 2015", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"We Love TV\" image campaign", "{3, 10, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can ignore \"is\" instead of \"it\" in \"Where is the ABC four-note jingle still in use?\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the ABC four-note jingle is no longer used for promotions and production company vanity cards, but it is still used at the beginning of ABC shows on demand.\nThe answer: ABC shows on demand", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the ABC logo first appeared as an on-screen bug in the 1993-94 season, but only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment. It wasn't until the 1995-96 season that the logo bug appeared throughout programs (except during commercial breaks). \nThe answer: 1993-94 season", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1995-96 season", "{rule list} 1, 16\nExplanation: We need to find the year of ABC's 40th anniversary. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, we know that the 40th anniversary was in 1983, so we can say that ABC was founded 40 years before 1983, which would be 1943. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can conclude that 1943 was the year of ABC's founding.\nThe answer: 1943", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"That Special Feeling\"", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies because the article mentions a specific year, and the rule that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\" applies because the article mentions multiple identification cards. \nThe answer: 1977", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the color of the background in ABC's 1977 ID sequence. Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession, so it is important to pay attention to it. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so it is important to look for words that refer to color. \nThe answer: black", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The color of the dot in ABC's 1977 ID sequence is a specific detail mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: The color of the dot was not mentioned in the article.", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between the old and new ABC logos. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the different concepts of the design of the letters and the shape of the logo. Rule 13 is relevant because it states that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Paul Rand", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, then A is less antonym(X) than B is also not relevant. The answer can be found by applying the rule that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. The article states that the letters in the ABC logo are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. Therefore, the answer is that the letters in the iconic ABC logo are reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s. \n\nThe answer: Bauhaus typeface", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Herbert Bayer", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the second sentence of the article, which states that the new logo debuted on-air for ABC's promos at the start of the 1963-64 season. Rule 1 applies because \"start of the 1963-64 season\" is a relative time frame and can be considered a comparison between before and after the start of the season. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific time frame. \nThe answer: 1963-64 season", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: ABC Radio", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the article, which states that ABC announced the restructuring on October 19, 2005.\nThe answer: October 19, 2005", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"ABC announced the restructuring of the group into six divisions.\" This means that ABC radio was restructured into six divisions.\nThe answer: six", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article. It states that in 2004, ABC's average viewership declined and the network landed in fourth place behind NBC, CBS, and Fox.\nThe answer: 2004", "{2, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that during the 2004-2005 season, ABC experienced unexpected success with new series such as Desperate Housewives, Lost, and Grey's Anatomy. The question specifically asks for the medical drama that helped ABC jump to second place in the ratings, which is Grey's Anatomy.\nThe answer: Grey's Anatomy", "{13, 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person who was named president of Disney-ABC television group in 2004. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, which means we need to look for a person's name. Rule 23 tells us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"On April 21, 2004, Disney announced a restructuring of its Disney Media Networks division with Anne Sweeney being named president of ABC parent Disney\u2013ABC Television Group\" is in the passive voice, so we need to identify the subject (Anne Sweeney) and the action (being named president). \nThe answer: Anne Sweeney", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"On December 7, 2005, ABC Sports and ESPN signed an eight-year broadcast rights agreement with NASCAR.\" This is a passive sentence, so we need to identify the object of the action (the thing being signed) as the answer. Additionally, we need to use rule 16 to correctly identify that ABC Sports and ESPN are two separate entities. Rule 23 is also relevant because it reminds us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: NASCAR", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2002", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that the question is asking for a person's profession, not their nationality.

Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, ABC did not remove itself from the cable company's systems, so we need to identify the cable company that removed ABC stations. Rule 7 applies because the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we need to identify relevant information about the cable company and ABC stations. Rule 12 applies because some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we need to focus on the information about the cable company and ABC stations. Rule 17 applies because negations are important for the answer, so we need to identify the cable company that removed ABC stations, not the one that kept them. \nThe answer: Time Warner Cable", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant information in the passage is that ABC filed a petition to the FCC to force Time Warner Cable to restore the affected stations, and the FCC ruled in favor of one of the parties. Rule 3 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: ABC", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the most-watched network for a specific season, which is a fact that can be directly extracted from the last sentence of the article. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"which major network was NOT the most watched\"), which means that the answer should be the opposite of what is stated in the question. Rule 23 is relevant because the sentence structure is passive, with the subject (\"ABC\") being acted upon the verb (\"ended\"). \nThe answer: ABC", "{3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the specific date when Time Warner Cable was forced to restore ABC stations, which is a straightforward fact-based question. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts like time and date are different from concepts like size and shape. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if we rephrase the question as \"When was Time Warner Cable not allowed to keep ABC stations off the air?\", we can use the negation to help us find the answer. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that we need to pay attention to the chronological order of events.

Rules 3 and 4 help us identify that \"newspapers\" and \"ABC\" are different concepts from \"television and radio stations\" and \"ESPN.\" Rule 16 helps us understand that \"former\" refers to the first entity mentioned (ABC) and \"latter\" refers to the last entity mentioned (Knight Ridder). \nThe answer: Knight Ridder", "{16, 19}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that Thomas Murphy was the president and CEO of ABC before the acquisition, and rule 19 to determine that the answer is Robert Iger.\nThe answer: Robert Iger", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is relevant because it helps us identify that Aaron Sorkin is a name and not a profession. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps us identify that \"Aaron Sorkin-created sitcom\" refers to the show that Aaron Sorkin created, not to Aaron Sorkin himself. \nThe answer: Sports Night", "{1, 3, 12}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a comparison between the dominance of color and other formats. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that color is a different concept from other formats. Rule 12 is relevant because it establishes that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: the 1965-66 season", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because the question asks about the dominant format for the three broadcast television networks, implying that there were other formats. The rule 16 applies because the question asks about the position of ABC among the other networks. \nThe answer: third place", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Beating the Odds: The Untold Story Behind the Rise of ABC\"", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"On May 1, 1953, ABC's New York City flagship stations \u2013 WJZ, WJZ-FM and WJZ-TV \u2013 changed their respective callsigns to WABC, WABC-FM and WABC-TV.\" This is a clear statement of when the call signs were changed.\nThe answer: May 1, 1953", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"ABC's New York City flagship stations...moved their operations to facilities at 7 West 66th Street.\" This is a passive sentence, where the subject (ABC's New York City flagship stations) is acted upon the verb (moved). Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the flagship stations moved to 7 West 66th Street. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we know that the stations were moved to 7 West 66th Street by someone or something else. \nThe answer: 7 West 66th Street", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the WJZ callsign was reassigned to an ABC affiliate in Baltimore in 1959.

This is a straightforward question that requires identifying the person who was appointed as ABC's president in 1950. Rule 16 helps to establish that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Robert Kintner was appointed before Noble's death in 1958. Rule 23 reminds us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which means that \"Noble appointed Robert Kintner\" is a passive construction where Noble is the subject and Robert Kintner is the object. \nThe answer: Robert Kintner", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: DuMont Television Network", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be used interchangeably.

Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"flagship\" which implies that the program was the most important or prominent one for the network. Rule 4 applies because the question mentions the network ABC, which is a different concept from the genre of Westerns. \nThe answer: The Lone Ranger", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from other concepts is irrelevant to the question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps us identify the correct show. \nThe answer: The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Cheyenne", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sugarfoot", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: their agreement with Walt Disney", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that ABC presented its film adaptations as part of a \"wheel series.\" Rule 1 applies because \"mixed success\" implies that some adaptations were more successful than others, and therefore some were less successful.

Rule 1 is relevant because it tells us that if A debuted before B, then B debuted after A. Rule 3 is relevant because it tells us that the concept of football is different from soap operas. Rule 12 is relevant because it tells us that the information about soap operas is irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Monday Night Football", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Sunday Night Football took over as the NFL's marquee game in 2006 when it moved to NBC as part of a broadcast deal that saw Monday Night Football move to ESPN. Therefore, Sunday Night Football premiered on NBC in 2006.\nThe answer: 2006", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Sunday Night Football took over as the premier game of the week, making Monday Night Football less important. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about a network, which is a different concept from the program itself. Rule 16 applies because the question asks about a change in network for Monday Night Football. \nThe answer: ESPN", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. First comes before last and last comes after first, so the mention of All My Children is not relevant. Goldenson is a person, so gender is irrelevant. The answer: an audience share of 15%\u201316%.", "{rule list: 17, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year, which is a numerical value and therefore follows rule 17. The passage provides a clear answer in a single sentence, making it easy to identify the relevant information and apply rule 16 to determine that the year mentioned in the passage is the answer.\nThe answer: 1970", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if the FCC passed regulations aimed at preventing networks from owning prime time programming, then ABC Films must have been owned by ABC. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the split occurred after the regulations were passed. Rule 23 is relevant because it establishes that the split was a result of the new rules. \nThe answer: 1972", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that in 1972, ABC Films was split into two separate companies: Worldvision Enterprises, which would produce and distribute programming for U.S. syndication, and ABC Circle Films as a production unit. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so \"ABC Films\" and \"Worldvision Enterprises\" are considered different entities. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"Worldvision Enterprises\" is the first subdivision mentioned and is the one that produced programming for U.S. syndication.\nThe answer: Worldvision Enterprises", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the ban on cigarette advertising means that there is now less advertising of cigarettes on television and radio networks. Rule 3 applies because the ban on cigarette advertising is not related to the size, shape, age, or color of the cigarettes. Rule 17 applies because the ban is a negation of the ability to advertise cigarettes on television and radio networks. \nThe answer: cigarette advertising from all television and radio networks", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes the relationship between the ban on cigarette advertising and its effect on television networks. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes the chronological order of events, with the ban taking effect after the passing of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act. Rule 17 is relevant because the question specifically asks for the timing of the ban. \nThe answer: January 2, 1971.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Henry Plitt", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that Elton Rule came after Goldenson in the company hierarchy. We use rule 23 to understand that \"named\" is a passive verb, meaning that the subject (ABC) is acted upon by the verb (named). Therefore, Elton Rule was named the president and CEO of ABC after Goldenson suffered a heart attack.\nThe answer: Elton Rule", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Michael Eisner joined ABC in the year 1966.\nThe answer: 1966", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Happy Days originated as a segment on the anthology series Love, American Style, which means that Love, American Style came before Happy Days.\nThe answer: Happy Days", "{4, 13, 19}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any mention of nationality is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a specific name or title. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can't assume anything about Eisner's profession based on his gender. \nThe answer: developing youth-oriented programming", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it tells us that Eisner left ABC before becoming president of another company. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" is relevant because the question is asking for the object of the passive sentence \"Eisner became president of\" to be identified. \nThe answer: Paramount Pictures", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Fred Pierce was appointed as the president of ABC Television in the spring of 1975, and that in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered the success of its Cleveland affiliate's morning program. Therefore, the article does not provide information about who was the President of ABC Television in 1976.\nThe answer: N/A", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a person who held a specific position at ABC Entertainment. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we know that the answer will be a profession and not a nationality. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that \"Fred Silverman\" is the answer since he is the first person mentioned in the sentence and \"president and director of programming\" is his position. \nThe answer: Fred Silverman", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"In 1974, ABC premiered the detective series S.W.A.T.\" \nThe answer: S.W.A.T.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that Good Morning America debuted on November 3, 1975. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (passive voice). \nThe answer: November 3, 1975.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the passage, it is stated that Fred Silverman left ABC in 1978. Therefore, he must have held a position at ABC before leaving for his new position. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb.\" The sentence \"The rousing success of Happy Days also led to a successful spin-off series, Laverne & Shirley, which debuted in 1976\" is in the active voice, but the sentence \"who left ABC in 1978 to become president of NBC's entertainment division\" is in the passive voice. Therefore, we can infer that Fred Silverman left ABC to become president of NBC's entertainment division.\nThe answer: president of NBC's entertainment division", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a spinoff of Happy Days that debuted in 1976. According to the passage, the rousing success of Happy Days led to a successful spin-off series, Laverne & Shirley, which debuted in 1976. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). \nThe answer: Laverne & Shirley", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a term to describe a trend in television during the 1970s that featured attractive women in main and guest roles. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms for \"trend\" and \"television\" in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the passage describes a trend that featured attractive women. The answer: \"jiggle TV\".", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"January saw the premiere of Roots, a miniseries based on an Alex Haley novel that was published the previous year.\" The use of \"based on\" indicates that the answer is the name of an author whose novel was adapted into the miniseries. The rules selected are 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and 17 (negations are important for the answer) because the question contains the word \"author,\" which is a synonym for \"writer\" or \"novelist.\" \nThe answer: Alex Haley", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Aaron Spelling", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that The Love Boat \"lasted nine seasons.\"\nThe answer: nine", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The success of Roots, Happy Days and The Love Boat allowed the network to take first place in the ratings for the first time in the 1976\u201377 season.\" This means that ABC first took the lead spot in television rating during the 1976-77 season.\nThe answer: 1976-77 season", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of a television series that featured an openly gay character. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, which means that the character's profession or nationality are not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"first\"), which means that we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" and look for the opposite of what is being asked. \nThe answer: Soap.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that in 1977, Roone Arledge was named president of the new ABC News. This is a straightforward answer extraction question that requires no additional rules beyond basic comprehension.\nThe answer: Roone Arledge", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can assume that being president of ABC Sports is a profession and not a nationality. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that ABC News is the first division mentioned and therefore the one being referred to in the question. \nThe answer: ABC Sports", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the construction of two buildings by ABC in New York City, one on Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street and the other on West 67th Street. The question specifically asks for the nickname of the building on Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street. Therefore, we can ignore the information about the building on West 67th Street. The passage also mentions that the facility built on Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street is nicknamed \"7 Lincoln Square\" even though it is not actually located at that address. \nThe answer: 7 Lincoln Square", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: June 1979", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: June 1978", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The article states that Hugh Downs was appointed as the anchor of 20/20. \"His\" in the rule 20 refers to Hugh Downs, who is mentioned in the article as a male name.\nThe answer: Hugh Downs", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts (4) and first comes before last and last comes after first (16) help us identify that Hugh Downs was appointed as the anchor of 20/20 and later paired alongside his former Today colleague Barbara Walters, who is a female name (20).\nThe answer: Barbara Walters", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: MCA Inc.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: ABC proposed a 24-hour news channel called ABC Cable News to compete with CNN.\nThe answer: ABC Cable News", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules that apply are 3 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 4 (animals and vehicles are different concepts), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The passage discusses ABC's attempts to launch a 24-hour news channel, but the question specifically asks about the network launched in July 2004. Therefore, we can ignore the earlier attempts and focus on the launch in 2004. The answer is ABC News Now.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: WJRT-TV", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that ABC purchased WTVG in Toledo, Ohio in August 1994. This is a straightforward question of identifying the affiliate that ABC purchased, so rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) are the most relevant. \nThe answer: WTVG", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about a strike that affected network programs in the 2007-2008 season. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between two entities based on a comparative adjective, which is the case with the strike and the production of network programs. Rule 17 is also relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer, and the question includes the word \"halted,\" which is a negation. Therefore, the answer is: Writers Guild of America strike.", "{rule list: 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The question contains the word \"replacement,\" indicating that the answer is a program that was aired during the Writers Guild of America strike. Therefore, rules 17 and 18 are relevant, as they state that negations in the question are important for the answer. Additionally, rule 23 is relevant, as it distinguishes between active and passive sentences, which may affect the wording of the answer. \nThe answer: Duel", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that rumors were started by Caris & Co. in 2008 that ABC would sell its ten owned-and-operated stations.\nThe answer: Caris & Co.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules of different concepts (3) and profession and nationality (4) are relevant because the question asks about a merger involving Disney-ABC Television Group and another entity. Rule 16 is relevant because it specifies that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" \nThe answer: ABC Entertainment", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts is also not relevant. The most relevant rules are that if A and B are merged, the resulting entity is named after the two (rule 1) and that the names of entities are equally important for the answer (rule 13). \nThe answer: ABC Entertainment Group", "{4, 10, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the new name of ABC Radio after it was rebranded. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and brand names are different concepts. Rule 10 is relevant because it states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, which means that we can assume that \"it's\" is a typo and should be corrected to \"its\". Rule 13 is relevant because it reminds us that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Citadel Media", "{rule list: 2, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the specific date and the agreement made between ABC and Apple. Rule 2 is relevant because it helps identify the specific date mentioned in the question. Rule 16 is relevant because it helps identify that the answer should come after the date mentioned in the question. Rule 23 is relevant because it helps identify that the answer will likely be in the passive voice. \nThe answer: iTunes.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from other concepts means that the answer should focus on the specific year mentioned in the article. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B means that the answer should use the word \"lowest\" instead of \"worst\" to accurately reflect the comparison being made. \nThe answer: 2010", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article mentions the sixth and final season of Lost, implying that there were five seasons before it. Therefore, the first season of Lost debuted before the sixth season.\nThe answer: 2004", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that Ugly Betty's ratings collapsed dramatically after it was moved to Fridays at the start of its fourth season in the fall of 2009. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (Ugly Betty's ratings) is acted upon the verb (collapsed) by the object (the move to Fridays). Therefore, we need to use rules 17 and 23 to take into account the negation in the question and the passive voice in the answer.\nThe answer: Fridays", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: Ugly Betty's ratings collapsed after it was moved to Fridays at the start of its fourth season in the fall of 2009. An attempt to boost ratings by moving the dramedy to Wednesdays failed.\nThe answer: Wednesdays", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when the FCC began imposing fin-syn rules, which is an action taken by the FCC. Therefore, we need to apply rule 23, which states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb. The sentence \"When the FCC imposed its fin-syn rules in 1970\" is in the passive voice, so we need to invert the subject and the verb to get \"The FCC imposed its fin-syn rules in 1970.\" Then, we can apply rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer, to eliminate any possible negative phrasing in the question. \nThe answer: 1970", "{1, 4, 15}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a company created in response to the FCC's fin-syn rules, indicating a comparison between before and after the rules were imposed. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about a company created by ABC, which is a network and therefore a profession. Rule 15 applies because the question asks about a company created by ABC in response to the FCC's fin-syn rules, indicating that the company was created after the rules were imposed. \nThe answer: Worldvision Enterprises", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The relevant rules are that first comes before last and last comes after first, and that names are equally important for the answer. The answer is ABC Circle Films.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Turner Broadcasting System", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question, as it is about divisions within a company. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant, as it helps us identify which division is being referred to. The answer is Disney-ABC Domestic Television. \nThe answer: Disney-ABC Domestic Television", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the previous name of Disney-ABC Domestic Television is not related to its current nationality. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"formerly known as Buena Vista Television\" refers to the previous name of Disney-ABC Domestic Television. \nThe answer: Buena Vista Television", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Disney-ABC International Television was previously known as Buena Vista International Television is not relevant to the answer. However, the rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can use this rule to determine that Disney-ABC International Television was previously known as Buena Vista International Television. \nThe answer: Buena Vista International Television", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so \"Selmur Productions\" is not a person's name, but a company name. Therefore, we can use rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer. The answer is the Selznick library.\nThe answer: Selznick library", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that WABC-TV and WPVI-TV were the first two stations to carry ABC's programming.\nThe answer: WABC-TV and WPVI-TV", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"As of March 2015, ABC has eight owned-and-operated stations.\" This directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 8", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that as of March 2015, ABC had affiliation agreements with 235 additional television stations. This means that ABC had affiliation agreements with 235 stations in 2015.\nThe answer: 235", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and the passage does not provide any information about them. The only relevant information is the percentage of American households reached by ABC in March 2015.\nThe answer: 96.26%", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The first logo was introduced in 1946.\nThe answer: 1946", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3 (shape is a different concept from other factors) and rule 16 (first comes before last). The answer is: the seal of the Federal Communications Commission.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article describes the evolution of the ABC logo, with the first logo introduced in 1946 and subsequent logos introduced in 1953 and 1957. The question specifically asks about the adoption of the \"iconic circle logo,\" which is not mentioned in the article. However, the use of the word \"iconic\" suggests that this logo is well-known and has been in use for a significant amount of time. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it can be inferred that the circle logo was adopted sometime after 1957, when the previous logo was introduced. \nThe answer: After 1957 (or sometime after the introduction of the \"ABC Circle A\" logo)", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" applies here, as the sentence \"With the 2011 cancellation of Supernanny\" clearly indicates that the cancellation happened in 2011. \nThe answer: 2011", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Supernanny", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that all of ABC's programming has been presented in HD since January 2012, except for certain holiday specials produced prior to 2005. This means that the answer is HD.\nThe answer: HD", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules include distinguishing between different concepts (3, 4, 5, 6), considering synonyms (7), considering negations (17), and ignoring irrelevant information (12). The answer is Litton's Weekend Adventure. \nThe answer: Litton's Weekend Adventure.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The article states that ABC's master feed is transmitted in 720p high definition.\nThe answer: 720p high definition", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that most of Hearst Television's ABC-affiliated stations transmit the network's programming in 1080i HD, which is a higher resolution than 720p. Therefore, according to rule 3, we cannot assume that 720p is more or less than 1080i, but according to rule 8, we can infer that 720p and 1080i are antonyms. \nThe answer: 1080i HD", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the number of ABC affiliates that carry the network feed in 480i standard definition. Rule 3 tells us that size and resolution are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of 720p and 1080i. Rule 4 tells us that profession and affiliation are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of Hearst Television and other companies. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"How many affiliates carry the ABC network feed in a resolution other than 1080i HD?\" Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the phrase \"either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.\" This means that some affiliates may not be able to transmit in HD due to technical limitations or lack of equipment. Therefore, the answer is 11", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Contractions in the question are also irrelevant. The answer: 720p high definition.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific drama that was renewed for a second season. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the professions of the characters in the dramas. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first drama mentioned in the sentence is the one being referred to. \nThe answer: Body of Proof", "{3, 4, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is relevant because it helps us identify that we are looking for a comedy show, not a comedian. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts is not relevant. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps us identify that we are looking for a specific show. The answer: Happy Endings.", "{rule list: 3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the network that ABC beat out for third place in television ratings in 2010-11. Rule 3 states that size and rankings are different concepts, so we need to pay attention to the specific ranking mentioned in the article. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that ABC is not in first or second place. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to note that ABC outrated NBC, meaning that NBC is the network that ABC beat out. \nThe answer: NBC", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"the new lows hit by Brothers & Sisters led to its cancellation\" during the 2010-11 season. \nThe answer: Brothers & Sisters", "{1, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A) and rule 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph). The passage states that ABC canceled \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" in 2011. \"Soap operas\" is a synonym for these shows. \nThe answer: All My Children and One Life to Live", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: ABC canceled All My Children and One Life to Live, but sold the rights to both shows to Prospect Park. \nThe answer: Prospect Park", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that both shows were revived on Hulu for one additional season in 2013. The use of negation in the question is important because it specifies that the shows were only revived for one season, not multiple seasons.\nThe answer: Hulu", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that a talk/lifestyle show replaced One Life to Live, and that show was called The Revolution. Rule 4 applies because profession and TV show genre are different concepts, and rule 16 applies because the question asks for the replacement show. \nThe answer: The Revolution", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific demographic that ABC dropped to fourth place in during the 2011-12 season. Rule 3 states that age and ratings are different concepts, so we can eliminate any rules related to age demographics. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the demographic that ABC dropped to fourth place in, not the demographic that they were previously in fourth place in. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3 and 17. \nThe answer: 18-49 demographic", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time in the past, so rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant.

Rule 12 tells us that some parts of the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the other shows mentioned in the paragraph. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that we are looking for two specific comedies. \nThe answer: The Middle and Modern Family.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which means that the fact that Shark Tank is a reality show is not relevant to the answer. However, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if Shark Tank is based on Dragon's Den, then Dragon's Den is the original reality show that Shark Tank is based on. \nThe answer: Dragon's Den", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sunday", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts (4) and first comes before last and last comes after first (16) help us identify that \"Tim Allen\" is the name of the actor who starred in the sitcom. The rule that \"he\" refers to male names (20) confirms that Tim Allen is male.\nThe answer: Tim Allen", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 applies because \"departed\" implies that the person left their position, and the rule 22 applies because there are two people mentioned in the sentence. \nThe answer: Daniel Burke", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: In the sentence \"Daniel Burke departed from Capital Cities/ABC in February 1994, with Thomas Murphy taking over as president before ceding control to Robert Iger,\" the passive voice is used to indicate that Thomas Murphy took over as president after Daniel Burke left.

Rule 2 applies because it compares Wide World of Sports to other sports programs. Rule 16 applies because it specifies the date of the debut. \nThe answer: Wide World of Sports", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The question asks for the creator of ABC's Wide World of Sports. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A is the creator of B, then B is the creation of A.

Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore those details as well. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that Sports Programs, Inc. was the company that ABC purchased. \nThe answer: Sports Programs, Inc.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that \"American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres\" is the first entity mentioned in the sentence and \"American Broadcasting Companies\" is the last. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence is in the active voice, and therefore \"American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres\" is the subject and \"was renamed\" is the verb. \nThe answer: American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres was renamed as the American Broadcasting Companies.", "{1, 2, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and superlatives, which are important for identifying the specific program mentioned in the question.

This information is presented in a passive sentence, so rule 23 applies to correctly identify the subject and object of the sentence. Rule 16 also applies to correctly order the address as \"1330 Avenue of the Americas\" followed by \"Manhattan\" and \"54th Street\". \nThe answer: 1330 Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, at the corner of 54th Street.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the percentage of prime-time TV viewership represented by the three major networks in 1980.

Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a comparison of the three major networks to all prime-time TV viewership, so we need to use the antonym of \"represented\" to determine that the three major networks accounted for 90% of all prime-time TV viewership in the US in 1980.\nThe answer: 90%", "{1, 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify a drama from Aaron Spelling that debuted on ABC in the 80s.

Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that Tim Allen is a comedian and focus on the fact that he is an actor. Rule 16 tells us that we should prioritize the order of events, so we know that Home Improvement debuted before the other sitcoms mentioned in the passage. Rules 20 and 21 tell us that \"he\" refers to male names and \"his\" refers to male names, so we can infer that the comedy show in question features a male lead. \nThe answer: Home Improvement", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: General Hospital", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion between talk shows and their hosts.

The answer is \"7:00 to 9:00 a.m.\"", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that the host's nationality is irrelevant to the answer. The rule that \"he\" refers to male names tells us that the host is male. \nThe answer: Jimmy Kimmel.", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific locations of the low-power stations are irrelevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the specific names of the stations are irrelevant. Questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"locally licensed affiliate\" can be understood as a licensed affiliate. Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the information about low-power stations can be ignored. Negations are important for the answer, so \"does not have\" is important. \nThe answer: New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Delaware.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The rules of different concepts and the importance of names and locations are relevant here.

The mention of low-power stations and digital simulcasts is not relevant to the answer. Names and locations are equally important. Negations are important for the answer.

Therefore, the answer is: ABC Studios.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" helps us identify that the answer is related to a specific location. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the first mentioned production facility is the one located in Hollywood, California. \nThe answer: The ABC Television Center (now The Prospect Studios) on Prospect Avenue in Hollywood, California.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that ABC has two main production facilities: the ABC Television Center (now The Prospect Studios) in Hollywood, California, and the ABC Television Center, East, located throughout New York City.

Therefore, the answer is Peter Jennings. \nThe answer: Peter Jennings", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Peter Jennings was a longtime ABC News chief anchor and anchor of World News Tonight. \nThe answer: World News Tonight", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that ABC has a traditional VOD service, and the question asks for its current name. Rule 3 states that concepts such as names are different from concepts such as size or shape, so we can focus on the specific name of the service. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: ABC on Demand", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts applies because the question asks about a streaming service, which is not related to either profession or nationality. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts also applies because the question is not about either animals or vehicles. \nThe answer: Hulu", "{rule list: 8, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that ABC's programming has been available on Hulu since July 6, 2009, as part of an agreement reached in April of that year. This means that the answer requires understanding the timeline of events, which is provided by rules 8 (for understanding the relationship between different time periods), 12 (for ignoring irrelevant information), and 16 (for understanding the order of events). \nThe answer: July 6, 2009", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer involves a business deal between Disney and Hulu, so rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) is not relevant. However, rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant because the question asks specifically about the percentage stake that Disney acquired. \nThe answer: 27%", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The article states that recent episodes of ABC shows are usually made available on WATCH ABC, Hulu, and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast.

Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that \"time\" is a different concept from \"restrictions\". Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms such as \"available\" and \"streaming\". Rule 17 is relevant because it specifies that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: 8 days", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that ABC on Demand disallows fast forwarding of accessed content.\nThe answer: fast forwarding", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage that states \"Restrictions implemented by Disney\u2013ABC Television Group on January 7, 2014 restrict streaming of the most recent episode of any ABC program on Hulu and WATCH ABC until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing.\" \nThe answer: January 7, 2014", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: LoyalKaspar", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage, which states that the updated logo is displayed in four variants shading the respective color used with the circle design's native black coloring.

Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the information about the logo variants and colors is not relevant. Rule 17 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to focus on the word \"new\" in the question. \nThe answer: \"ABC Modern\"", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The article describes the introduction of a revised version of the ABC logo, which comes in four different color variants.

Rule 3 states that concepts such as profession and nationality are different, so we can ignore the professions of the people involved and focus on their roles. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can look for the antonym of \"expressed doubts\" to find the regulator who had doubts. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negation of the regulator expressing doubts. \nThe answer: Donald F.

Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can identify that the E. W. Scripps Company is the recipient of the sale, making it the answer to the question.\nThe answer: The E. W. Scripps Company.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts like age and color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for the maximum number of stations that broadcasters were allowed to own, which implies that there was a limit. Therefore, we can infer that the new ownership rules implemented by the FCC in 1985 allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations. \nThe answer: 12", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: September 5, 1985", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts and first coming before last apply here. ABC and Capital Cities merged to form a new company known as Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.\nThe answer: Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if one person is named in relation to another, the two are being compared. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer will not be a nationality. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the order in which people are mentioned matters. \nThe answer: president of ABC's broadcasting division", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify who became the vice president of ABC broadcasting after the merger between ABC and Capital Cities. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that we need to look for the relevant information in the paragraph that talks about changes in management. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which means that we need to look for an active sentence that mentions the name of the person who became the vice president. The sentence \"Michael P. Millardi became vice president of ABC Broadcasting\" satisfies both rules. \nThe answer: Michael P. Millardi", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the president of ABC News and ABC Sports, which are both part of ABC's broadcasting division. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific person's position within the company. Rule 23 applies because the sentence structure is passive, with \"Roone Arledge\" being the subject of the sentence and \"president of ABC News and ABC Sports\" being the verb. \nThe answer: Roone Arledge", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Laverne & Shirley", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The question asks for a sitcom that produced a spinoff for ABC after ending its run in 1984. The article mentions that Three's Company ended in 1984 and produced a short-lived spinoff that year. Therefore, the answer is Three's Company.", "{rule list: 18, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the network that regained the ratings lead in America in 1984. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"regained.\" Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we know that the answer refers to a network. \nThe answer: NBC", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage discusses ABC's focus on comedies and family-oriented series in the mid-1980s, and mentions several shows that were part of this lineup. The question specifically asks for a comedy that ended its broadcast run in 1986. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can ignore the other shows mentioned in the passage. Rule 16 states that \"last comes after first,\" so we can assume that the show mentioned last in the passage, Perfect Strangers, is not the answer. Therefore, the answer is The Love Boat. \nThe answer: The Love Boat", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the profession of ABC is not affected by NBC's success. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, since NBC was successful with dramas, ABC refocused on comedies and family-oriented series. \nThe answer: comedies and family-oriented series", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that ABC revamped its Friday night schedule around family-friendly comedies in the late 1980s, culminating in the 1989 debut of the \"TGIF\" block. This means that the answer is \"TGIF\". \nThe answer: TGIF", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The abbreviation \"TGIF\" is mentioned in the passage and is followed by an explanation in parentheses. Rule 17 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that \"stand for\" is a negation of \"is an abbreviation for\". Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed and \"latter\" to the last, so we know that \"Going Places\" is the last show listed in the \"TGIF\" block. \nThe answer: Thank Goodness It's Funny", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the production company that produced most of the shows in the TGIF lineup. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the production company is based at Warner Bros. and had a development deal with Paramount Television are not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the name of the production company, Miller-Boyett Productions, is the relevant information. \nThe answer: Miller-Boyett Productions", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Miller-Boyett Productions was a studio affiliated with Warner Bros., as stated in the article. Rule 4 applies to distinguish between the concepts of studio and company. Rule 16 applies to determine that \"Warner Bros.\" comes before \"Paramount Television\" in the article. \nThe answer: Warner Bros.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: seven", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Charly", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Ralph Nelson", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The article mentions that ABC Pictures was renamed to ABC Motion Pictures in 1979 and then dissolved in 1985.

The order of the information in the passage follows the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\"\nThe answer: between 10% and 18% of the total U.S. population", "{rule list: 4, 13, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a specific person and their position within a company, which falls under rule 13. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer will not be a nationality. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the person's first name will come before their last name. Rule 23 reminds us that passive voice is used in this article, so we need to look for the person who was in the position of ABC Entertainment president in 1957.\nThe answer: Ollie Treiz", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the host of the Bandstand show that debuted on ABC in 1957. The relevant rules are 16 and 23, which state that first comes before last and that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb. The answer is Dick Clark. \nThe answer: Dick Clark", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The answer is the \"philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors\".", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so any information about vehicles is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the ABC action series went up against NBC's variety shows. \nThe answer: ABC's western series (and series such as the actioner Zorro)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Life", "{rule list: 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: ABC used detective shows as counterprogramming against the variety shows aired by NBC and CBS in the fall of 1959. The use of the word \"defeated\" in the passage implies that ABC's detective shows were successful in drawing audiences away from their competitors. The negation in the question (\"what kind of shows were used as counterprogramming\") and the use of the word \"these\" in the passage both indicate that the answer should be specific to a certain type of show. Therefore, rules 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph), and 17 (negations are important for the answer) are relevant. \nThe answer: detective shows", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific service that ABC launched in May 2013. The relevant information in the article is that ABC launched \"WATCH ABC\", a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to make sure that the answer is not something that ABC did not launch. Rule 23 reminds us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The answer is: \"WATCH ABC\".", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Hearst Television", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that ESPN is a network and not a profession is important. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for a word or phrase in the passage that is similar to \"WATCH ESPN\". The passage mentions \"sister network ESPN's WatchESPN service\", so the answer is WatchESPN.\nThe answer: WatchESPN", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rules about profession and nationality being different concepts are not relevant to this question, as it is asking about broadcast groups. The relevant rules are that size and shape are different concepts, and that animals and vehicles are different concepts. The answer is Sinclair Broadcast Group.", "{3, 5, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (size is a different concept), 5 (animals and vehicles are different concepts), and 12 (irrelevant passages should be ignored). The question asks for the biggest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, which is WABM-DT2/WDBB-DT2 in the Birmingham market. \nThe answer: WABM-DT2/WDBB-DT2 in the Birmingham market.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify the largest ABC station operator in terms of market reach, which is a measure of size. Rule 4 tells us that size and profession are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the companies' professions. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can look for information about which company has the most stations. The passage tells us that Sinclair owns or provides services to 28 ABC affiliates, while Scripps owns 15 ABC-affiliated stations and provides ABC programming for the majority of Arizona and Southern Nevada. Therefore, Sinclair is the largest ABC station operator in terms of numerical total. However, the passage also tells us that Scripps is the largest operator in terms of overall market reach, since it owns affiliates in larger markets such as Cleveland, Phoenix, Detroit, and Denver. Therefore, the answer is The E. W. Scripps Company. \n\nThe answer: The E. W. Scripps Company.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the number of affiliates owned or serviced by Sinclair compared to other operators. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a numerical answer.\nThe answer: 28 ABC affiliates and two additional subchannel-only affiliates", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the number of ABC affiliates owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group is not relevant to the answer. We use rule 16 to determine that \"largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach\" refers to the E. W. Scripps Company. \nThe answer: 15", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Start Here\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Troika", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"color is a different concept\" is relevant because it clarifies that the color of the ribbons is not related to their function. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is also relevant because it indicates that the specific mention of \"entertainment division\" is important for the answer.\nThe answer: entertainment division", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is \"ABC News\".", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that WFTS-TV and WWSB are separately owned and operated affiliates that serve the same market in Tampa, Florida. \nThe answer: WFTS-TV and WWSB", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: KMBC-TV and KQTV", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Grand Rapids, Michigan has two separately owned and operated ABC affiliates, which are WZZM and WOTV. \nThe answer: WZZM and WOTV", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of Tampa's primary ABC affiliate prior to 1994. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name of the affiliate. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"prior\" which indicates that we are looking for the affiliate that was in place before 1994. \nThe answer: WTSP", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the name of the empire that Genghis Khan founded, which is a concept and therefore falls under rule 3. We also need to consider rule 4, which reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Finally, we need to keep in mind that names are important, as per rule 13. \nThe answer: Mongol Empire.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan united many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia.\nThe answer: many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about regions where civilians were massacred, implying that these regions were more affected by the massacres than others. Rule 3 applies because the question distinguishes between regions and the act of massacring civilians. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about a negative aspect (massacres) and how it affected certain regions. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"did not\") which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Khwarezmian and Xia controlled lands", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire and started the Mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of Eurasia. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.\nThe answer: Central Asia and China", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Qara Khitai, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 1 to infer that if Genghis Khan assigned \u00d6gedei Khan as his successor, then \u00d6gedei Khan was his successor. We use rule 16 to determine that the first mention of Genghis Khan's death is before the mention of his conquests. We use rule 23 to understand that the sentence \"He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia\" is in the active voice, meaning that Genghis Khan died and not the Western Xia. \nThe answer: \u00d6gedei Khan", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan died in 1227.\nThe answer: 1227", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the last empire that Genghis Khan conquered before he died, which implies a chronological order. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which helps us understand the order of events. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, which we can apply to the question to understand that the empire conquered before Genghis Khan's death was the last one he defeated. Rule 23 reminds us that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, which is important to understand the sentence \"the Western Xia was defeated\". \nThe answer: Western Xia.", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Genghis Khan split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons before he died. This follows rules 1 and 4, which state that profession/nationality and first/last order are important, respectively. Rule 16 also applies as it specifies that the order of events should be considered. \nThe answer: his sons and grandsons", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia at an unknown location. The use of \"unmarked\" and \"unknown location\" indicate a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Genghis Khan was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia at an unknown location.", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if Tem\u00fcjin was born in Del\u00fc\u00fcn Boldog, then Del\u00fc\u00fcn Boldog is less likely to be where Genghis Khan was born. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about Genghis Khan's birthplace, not his name, family, or any other concept. Rule 13 applies because the question specifically asks for the name \"Genghis Khan.\" \nThe answer: Northern Mongolia, near Burkhan Khaldun mountain and the Onon and Kherlen rivers.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it is stated that Tem\u00fcjin's father was Yes\u00fcgei, a Khamag Mongol's major chief of the Kiyad and an ally of Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe.\nThe answer: Yes\u00fcgei", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1162", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: Tem\u00fcjin was named after a Tatar chieftain, Tem\u00fcjin-\u00fcge, whom his father had just captured.

Tem\u00fcjin was to live there in service to Dai Setsen, the head of the new household, until he reached the marriageable age of 12.\nThe answer: Dai Setsen", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Tem\u00fcjin's older half-brother, Begter, began to exercise the power of the eldest male in the family. This is an example of a passive sentence where Begter is the subject being acted upon by the verb \"exercise\". Rule 16 establishes that in a list of siblings, the firstborn is the eldest and the lastborn is the youngest. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon by the verb. Therefore, the answer is Begter.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Begter, Temujin's older half-brother, would eventually exercise the power of the eldest male in the family and that Temujin's mother Hoelun would have to accept him as her husband if and when he became an adult. Rule 1 applies because \"Begter would have been Hoelun's husband\" is equivalent to \"Hoelun would have been Begter's wife.\" Rule 4 applies because \"Begter's position as eldest male in the family\" is a different concept from \"Begter's nationality.\" Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"would have to accept him\") which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Hoelun", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if Tem\u00fcjin and Khasar killed Begter, then Begter did not kill them. Rule 16 applies because \"Tem\u00fcjin's brother Khasar\" comes after \"Tem\u00fcjin\" in the sentence.\nThe answer: Tem\u00fcjin and Khasar", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Begter was killed during a hunting excursion that Tem\u00fcjin and his brother Khasar went on. This is a simple chronological order, which follows rule 16. Additionally, the sentence structure is in the passive voice, with Begter being the object of the verb \"killed\", which follows rule 23.\nThe answer: During a hunting excursion.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Tayichi'ud", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tem\u00fcjin was enslaved by the Tayichi'ud and reportedly held with a cangue, a sort of portable stocks. The use of \"reportedly\" indicates that this information may not be entirely reliable, but it is the only information given in the passage about how he was kept imprisoned. The negation in the question (\"how was he kept imprisoned\") and the use of the word \"how\" indicate that the answer should describe the method of imprisonment. Therefore, rules 3 and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: with a cangue, a sort of portable stocks", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the father of Chilaun", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a comparison between two things (Tem\u00fcjin and his future generals). Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts (people and time periods). Rule 13 applies because it states that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Jelme and Bo'orchu", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Tem\u00fcjin was held prisoner by the Tayichi'ud and was able to escape from the ger (yurt) in the middle of the night by hiding in a river crevice.\nThe answer: in a river crevice", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that arranged marriages were often used to solidify temporary alliances among the tribal confederations of Mongolia. Additionally, the question asks for what was used to form political alliances, which implies that the answer should focus on the political aspect rather than the temporary nature of the alliances. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 are relevant. \nThe answer: Arranged marriages", "{rule list: 19, 23}\nExplanation: Tem\u00fcjin's gender is not relevant to the answer, so rule 19 applies. The question asks about who taught Tem\u00fcjin early lessons about politics in Mongolia, which is a passive sentence where \"Tem\u00fcjin\" is the subject being taught. Therefore, rule 23 applies, which states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: Hoelun", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"foreign forces\" in the passage. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"interference\" in the passage. \nThe answer: Chinese dynasties", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The need for alliances.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Tem\u00fcjin married B\u00f6rte of the Onggirat tribe as arranged by his father.\nThe answer: Onggirat tribe", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the kidnapper of Tem\u00fcjin's first wife, and the passage states that she was kidnapped by the Merkits. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific action (kidnapping) and the answer provides a different concept (the Merkits). Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a specific person (the kidnapper) and the answer provides a different person (the Merkits). \nThe answer: the Merkits", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the person who helped Tem\u00fcjin, and the passage states that his friend and future rival Jamukha and his protector Toghrul Khan helped him. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a person, and the answer is a group of people. \nThe answer: Jamukha and Toghrul Khan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jochi", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1185", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to determine the number of sons B\u00f6rte had with Genghis Khan after Jochi. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can ignore the birth order of the sons. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Jochi was the first son. Therefore, B\u00f6rte had three more sons after Jochi, for a total of four sons: Chagatai, \u00d6gedei, Tolui. \nThe answer: 3 sons.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: We need to find the name of B\u00f6rte's second male child, which means we need to find the second son's name. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first son mentioned is the oldest and the second son mentioned is the second oldest. Therefore, the answer is Chagatai.\nThe answer: Chagatai", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The sons referred to in the passage are Chagatai and \u00d6gedei. Chagatai died in 1241 and \u00d6gedei also died in 1241.\nThe answer: 1241", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: We can use rule 16 to determine that the last male child born to Genghis Khan and B\u00f6rte was Tolui.\nThe answer: Tolui", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: At least six names of Ghengis Khan's daughters are known.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a sworn brother or blood brother", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Tem\u00fcjin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally (or, according to other sources, a vassal) to his father's anda (sworn brother or blood brother) Toghrul\". This sentence indicates that Tem\u00fcjin's first important alliance was with his father's anda Toghrul.\nThe answer: Toghrul", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Toghrul is mentioned as Khan of the Keraites, which is a tribe.\nThe answer: Keraites", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Toghrul offered his vassal 20,000 of his Keraite warriors.\nThe answer: 20,000", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of one of Tem\u00fcjin's childhood friends that Toghrul suggested he enlist. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is relevant because the question asks for a specific person's name. \nThe answer: Jamukha", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is a nationality. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is a physical characteristic. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the passage states that Jamukha supported the traditional Mongolian aristocracy, while Tem\u00fcjin followed a meritocratic method and attracted a broader, though lower class, range of followers. Therefore, the answer is \"lower class.\" \n\nThe answer: lower class", "{3, 8, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if A is more powerful, then B is less powerful. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Kokochu", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Tem\u00fcjin was elected khan of the Mongols in 1186.\nThe answer: 1186", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1187, Jamukha launched an attack against Tem\u00fcjin shortly after he was elected khan, and Tem\u00fcjin was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut. Therefore, we can use rule 1 to infer that Jamukha won the battle and Tem\u00fcjin lost. We can also use rule 16 to determine that the Battle of Dalan Balzhut occurred after Tem\u00fcjin was elected khan. \nThe answer: Battle of Dalan Balzhut", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Toghrul, as Tem\u00fcjin's patron, was exiled to the Qara Khitai.\nThe answer: Qara Khitai", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"the Yassa code\" as the set of laws that Tem\u00fcjin followed and promised wealth to those who obeyed. This is the only mention of a set of laws in the passage, and the question specifically asks for the name of Tem\u00fcjin's laws.\nThe answer: Yassa code", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Tem\u00fcjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future possible war spoils in exchange for their absolute obedience and following his rule of law, the Yassa code.\nThe answer: wealth from future possible war spoils", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: orphans from the conquered tribe", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The first rule applies because Tem\u00fcjin promised wealth from future war spoils as an incentive for obedience and loyalty. The third rule applies because wealth and loyalty are different concepts. \nThe answer: Tem\u00fcjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future possible war spoils.", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person to whom Toghrul refused to give his daughter in marriage, which is a profession/nationality concept. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore nationality. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse concepts like age, size, shape, and color with each other. Rule 5 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts, which is not relevant here. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is not relevant here. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is not relevant here. Therefore, we only need to apply rule 1, which tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, Toghrul refused to give his daughter in marriage to Jochi, the eldest son of Tem\u00fcjin, so we can say that Toghrul refused to give his daughter in marriage to", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Toghrul allied himself with Jamukha, who already opposed Tem\u00fcjin's forces.\nThe answer: Jamukha", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jamukha", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Keraite tribe", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Jamukha took refuge with the Naimans after escaping the conflict with Tem\u00fcjin, so the Naimans protected him.\nThe answer: the Naimans", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jamukha was elected G\u00fcr Khan in 1201.\nThe answer: 1201", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article explains that Jamukha was elected as G\u00fcr Khan, which is a title used by the rulers of the Qara Khitai. Therefore, the title G\u00fcr Khan is a specific title used by the rulers of the Qara Khitai.\nThe answer: The title G\u00fcr Khan is a title used by the rulers of the Qara Khitai.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a general who abandoned Jamukha's coalition, implying that the general was once part of the coalition but later left. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific individual who abandoned the coalition. \nThe answer: Subutai", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1206", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Tem\u00fcjin offered his friendship to Jamukha, making Jamukha less likely to be an enemy of Tem\u00fcjin. Rule 3 applies because the answer is about the specific thing that Tem\u00fcjin offered to Jamukha. Rule 8 applies because Jamukha refused the offer, making him more opposed to Tem\u00fcjin. \nThe answer: his friendship", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Tem\u00fcjin killed the men who betrayed Jamukha because they were disloyal to their leader and therefore less loyal than Tem\u00fcjin. \nThe answer: disloyalty", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a noble death by breaking the back", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jamukha requested a noble death without spilling blood, which is granted by breaking the back. This means that he hoped Tem\u00fcjin would allow him to be killed in this way.\nThe answer: breaking the back", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan adopted new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as siege warfare from the Chinese.\nThe answer: the Chinese", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify which rival's tribes Genghis Khan measured against the linchpin. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage.

The use of \"distance\" in the question is a synonym for \"drive a wedge.\" The negation in the question (\"allegedly trying to distance\") is important to note, as it indicates that the shaman was not trying to bring them closer together. \nThe answer: Khasar", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage does not mention anything about professions, nationalities, animals, vehicles, locations, or gender. The passage does mention Genghis Khan's extensive spy network, which he used for intelligence gathering.\nThe answer: economy (specifically, Genghis Khan's spy network)", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan had early allies, including Wang Khan, who was an ally of his father.

Rule 15 applies because it states that if A had profession X but changed to profession Y, then A has profession Y. Therefore, the answer is Khagan.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan was acknowledged as \"Khan\" of the consolidated tribes and took the new title \"Genghis Khan\" at a Khuruldai, a council of Mongol chiefs. The title Khagan was not conferred on Genghis until after his death, when his son and successor, \u00d6gedei, took the title for himself and extended it posthumously to his father. \nThe answer: No one gave Genghis Khan the title Khagan, it was taken by his son and successor, \u00d6gedei, after Genghis Khan's death.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"At a Khuruldai, a council of Mongol chiefs, Tem\u00fcjin was acknowledged as 'Khan' of the consolidated tribes and took the new title 'Genghis Khan'\" is in the active voice, meaning that Tem\u00fcjin was made khan by the council of Mongol chiefs.\nThe answer: the council of Mongol chiefs", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan planned to attack the Jin dynasty after conquering Western Xia.

Rule 16 applies to correctly order the events.) \nThe answer: Jin dynasty", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Ming-Tan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1215", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that after Genghis Khan captured and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing), the Emperor Xuanzong moved his capital south to Kaifeng, abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the Mongols. Therefore, the answer is Kaifeng. \nThe answer: Kaifeng", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Genghis Khan's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan, conquered Kaifeng, which led to the collapse of the Jin dynasty in 1234.\nThe answer: \u00d6gedei Khan", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Kuchlug, the deposed Khan of the Naiman confederation, fled west and usurped the khanate of Qara Khitai.\nThe answer: Kuchlug", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, and the rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. The question does not ask for the age or color of anything, and it does not mention any specific names. Therefore, the answer does not require any specific rule.\nThe answer: The Liao dynasty", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Genghis Khan sent \"only two tumen (20,000 soldiers)\" against Kuchlug and Qara Khitai.\nThe answer: 20,000 soldiers", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan sent a young general named Jebe, who was known as \"The Arrow\", to conquer Qara Khitai. This information is directly stated in the passage and can be identified using rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and rule 23 (active vs passive voice). \nThe answer: Jebe, known as \"The Arrow\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that \"Jebe\" is a general and rule 23 to understand that \"The Arrow\" is a moniker or nickname. \nThe answer: \"The Arrow\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that the Mongols were forced to change strategies and incite internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, indicating that their initial strategy was not successful. Rule 16 applies because the passage states that Kuchlug fled again after his army was defeated, implying that he had already fled before. \nThe answer: west of Kashgar", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the extent of the Mongol Empire after Kuchlug's demise, implying that Kuchlug's presence may have limited the Mongol Empire's expansion. Therefore, we apply rule 1 to infer that the Mongol Empire's extent was limited before Kuchlug's demise. Then, we apply rule 8 to infer that after Kuchlug's demise, the Mongol Empire extended further west. \nThe answer: as far west as Lake Balkhash", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Mongol Empire extended as far west as Lake Balkhash, which bordered another empire to the west. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 12 states that irrelevant passages should be ignored. The answer: Khwarezmia.", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" (8) are relevant because the question asks for the type of state that Khwarezmia was, which is a nationality rather than a profession. The answer is that Khwarezmia was a Muslim state.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the leader of the Khwarezmian dynasty was Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad, who was in power in the early 13th century. The rule of \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence \"the Khwarazmian dynasty was governed by Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad\" is in the passive voice, and therefore Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad is the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity that ordered the attack on Genghis Khan's caravan, which is a negation. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 1 states that if A attacks B, then B is attacked by A. Rule 8 states that if A is the antonym of X, then B is the antonym of X and A is the antonym of B. Therefore, the answer is Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar. \nThe answer: Inalchuq", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Muslim", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from profession and nationality, so rule 3 applies. First comes before last, so rule 16 applies.\nThe answer: around 100,000 soldiers", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Silk Road as a commercial trading route between Khwarezmia and the Mongol Empire.\nThe answer: The Silk Road.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that first comes before last. The passage mentions that the Mongol army under Genghis Khan crossed the Tien Shan mountains, so the answer is Tien Shan mountains.\nThe answer: Tien Shan mountains", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Genghis Khan's army was divided into three groups.\nThe answer: three", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: secretly to the southeast part of Khwarezmia", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who led the third division alongside Genghis Khan. Rule 1 applies because it provides a way to rephrase the question as \"Who was less important than Genghis Khan in leading the third division in Khwarezmia?\" Rule 16 applies because it establishes that first comes before last and last comes after first, so Genghis Khan must have been listed first and the other leader second. \nThe answer: Tolui", "{1, 3, 6}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the area targeted by the first and second divisions, implying that they were targeting different areas. Rule 3 applies because \"northeast\" and \"southeast\" are directions, not specific locations. Rule 6 applies because the question asks about the specific type of attack used. \nThe answer: The first division targeted the northeast and the second division targeted the southeast in a pincer attack on Samarkand.", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: The fragmentation of the Shah's army into small groups concentrated in various cities allowed the Mongols to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense. This feature of the Shah's army enabled the weary Mongol forces easy early victories.\nThe answer: fragmentation into small groups concentrated in various cities", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Mongol army quickly seized the town of Otrar... Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians.\" The word \"massacre\" indicates a violent and deadly attack on the town. The use of \"wholesale\" emphasizes the scale of the attack. The word \"retribution\" indicates that the attack was in response to something that had been done to the Mongols. Therefore, rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) are relevant. \nThe answer: Otrar", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Inalchuq was executed by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, which is a form of torture and not a typical method of execution. The use of \"retribution\" in the passage indicates that this was a punishment for his actions. Therefore, we need to apply rule 3 to understand that \"silver\" is the answer, and rule 8 to understand that the opposite of \"silver\" is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: silver", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how the Shah's army was fragmented and defeated by the Mongols, leading to the Shah fleeing rather than surrendering. Therefore, the answer is that the Shah fled. \nThe answer: The Shah fled.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Subutai and Jebe", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions the Khwarezmid Empire and its capital, which was initially Samarkand but was later moved to Bukhara. The question asks for the capital before the Mongol invasion, so irrelevant information about Genghis Khan and the destruction of the empire can be ignored. The answer can be found by identifying the mention of the Khwarezmid Empire and its capitals. \nThe answer: Samarkand", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that after the Mongols conquered Samarkand, the capital was moved to Bukhara by the remaining men. \nThe answer: Bukhara", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: diverted a river", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying what the Mongols used as a shield during their attack on Samarkand. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the Mongols used their captured enemies as body shields.\nThe answer: captured enemies", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand.\nThe answer: He did not observe them.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: pyramids of severed heads", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: They opened the gates to the Mongols.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a unit of Turkish defenders", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, so the answer is artisans and craftsmen.\nThe answer: artisans and craftsmen", "{rule list: 20, 23}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan is a male name, so \"he\" refers to him. The sentence \"he declared that he was the flail of God, sent to punish them for their sins\" is in the active voice, so Genghis Khan is the subject and he is acting upon the verb \"declared\". Therefore, Genghis Khan described himself as \"the flail of God, sent to punish them for their sins\".\nThe answer: the flail of God, sent to punish them for their sins", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: young men who had not fought", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that after the defeat of the Khwarezmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces to return to Mongolia. Therefore, the year the Khwarezmian Empire fell to Genghis Khan was 1220.\nThe answer: 1220", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Subutai", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea.\" This indicates that Jebe and Subutai spent the winter near the Black Sea.\nThe answer: near the Black Sea", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Kalka River", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Batu", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The article does not provide the answer to the question.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Mongols added Transoxiana and Persia to their empire during the campaigns led by Subutai and Jebe, and later under Genghis Khan's grandson Batu and the Golden Horde. Therefore, the two Mongol leaders who added Persia to the Mongol Empire were Subutai and Jebe, and Batu. \nThe answer: Subutai, Jebe, and Batu", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Subutai and Jebe led a famous cavalry expedition and later returned to Mongolia in 1225. Since Subutai died on the road back to Samarkand, it can be inferred that the return to Mongolia was without him.\nThe answer: 1225", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand.\nThe answer: Samarkand", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage directly states that Genghis Khan began his retaliatory attack on the Tanguts in 1226.\nThe answer: 1226", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: autumn", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Mongols/Genghis Khan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Yellow River", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific omen that Genghis Khan saw, which is a detail mentioned in the passage. The answer is a description of the omen itself.\nThe answer: a line of five stars arranged in the sky", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The name of the Tangut capital is mentioned in the first sentence of the article, which is relevant to the answer. The name is a specific piece of information that can be extracted without any need for additional context.\nThe answer: Ning Hia", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the name of the Tangut general who fought Genghis Khan at Deshun. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Ma Jianlong is the general's name. Rule 23 tells us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. In this case, the sentence \"Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle\" is in the passive voice, so we need to rephrase it to \"Arrows in battle later killed Ma Jianlong\" to identify the cause of his death. \nThe answer: Ma Jianlong", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: arrows", "{rule list: 1, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan went to Liupanshan (Qingshui County, Gansu Province) to escape the severe summer after conquering Deshun. The relevant rules are 1 (to understand that Liupanshan is where Genghis Khan spent the summer), 12 (to ignore the irrelevant details about the Tangut emperor and the execution of the imperial family), and 16 (to understand that \"after taking Deshun\" means that it happened before Genghis Khan went to Liupanshan). \nThe answer: Liupanshan (Qingshui County, Gansu Province)", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. However, rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which is important to understand that Genghis Khan ordered the execution of the entire imperial family after their surrender. Rule 17 also states that negations are important for the answer, as the question asks what Genghis Khan did to the imperial family after their surrender. \nThe answer: ordered their execution", "{rule list: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the paternity dispute over Genghis Khan's oldest son Jochi, which was particularly contentious due to his seniority among his brothers. Chagatai was the one who voiced the issue most strongly and declared that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. Therefore, the answer is Jochi.\nThe answer: Jochi", "{1, 8, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"most strongly\" implies opposition, and therefore Chagatai being \"most strongly\" opposed means that he was more opposed than anyone else. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the \"most opposed\" and therefore the antonym of \"opposed\" is used to indicate that Chagatai was the most against Jochi. Rule 13 applies because names are important for the answer, as the question specifically asks for the name of the Mongol leader who was most opposed. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a superlative, and therefore the order of the brothers is important to determine who was the most opposed. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the \"most opposed\" and therefore the negation is important to indicate that Chagatai was the one who was against Jochi. \nThe answer: Chagatai", "{rule list: 2, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Chagatai publicly disputed Jochi's paternity before the invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire by Genghis Khan, as stated in The Secret History of the Mongols. This is indicated by the phrase \"just before\" in the passage, which implies a temporal relationship between the dispute and the military campaign. The names of the individuals involved are also important for the answer.\nThe answer: the invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire by Genghis Khan", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that \u00d6gedei, who is mentioned last in the passage, was appointed Genghis Khan's successor. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that the sentence \"\u00d6gedei was appointed as successor\" is in the passive voice, with \u00d6gedei as the subject and the appointment as the action. \nThe answer: \u00d6gedei.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can ignore the fact that Chagatai and Jochi are both sons of Genghis Khan. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Chagatai is not the youngest son. Therefore, the answer is Chagatai and Jochi. \nThe answer: Chagatai and Jochi.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as personality traits and age, cannot be compared. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, Chagatai was considered unstable, so the answer is Jochi, who was not disqualified for his behavior. \nThe answer: Jochi", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from profession or nationality, so it is relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Tolui is the youngest son. \nThe answer: Tolui", "{1, 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: We need to identify which son Genghis Khan viewed as dependable. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more dependable than B, then B is less dependable than A. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of professions. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify \u00d6gedei as the son who was chosen as Genghis Khan's successor. Rule 20 tells us that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can use \"he\" to refer to \u00d6gedei. \nThe answer: \u00d6gedei", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jochi died \"in 1226.\"\nThe answer: 1226", "{rule list: 16, 22, 23}\nExplanation: Jochi remained in Khorasan after Genghis Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, according to Rashid al-Din's report. This is supported by Juzjani's suggestion that Jochi had a quarrel with his brothers during the siege of Urgench, which was in Khorasan. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which helps to identify that Jochi is the first person mentioned in the passage. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed, which is Genghis Khan, and \"latter\" refers to the last entity listed, which is Sultan Muhammad. Rule 23 clarifies that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: Khorasan", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. In the passage, it is mentioned that Jochi attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. Therefore, the answer is Urgench. \nThe answer: Urgench", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who Jochi reportedly wanted to enlist to help him stop his father's massacres. This involves understanding the relationships between Jochi, Genghis Khan, and Sultan Muhammad, as well as the events leading up to Jochi's death. Rules 1, 3, 4, and 5 help ensure that comparisons between individuals and events are made accurately. Rules 7, 12, and 13 allow for the identification of the relevant information in the passage. Rules 16, 17, 18, 20, and 21 ensure that negations and pronouns are taken into account. Rule 23 helps with understanding the passive voice used in the passage. \nThe answer: Sultan Muhammad", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Juzjani claims that Jochi planned to make an alliance with Sultan Muhammad and support the Muslims, but this is historically suspect because Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223, as mentioned in the passage. Therefore, Jochi could not have made an alliance with him. \nThe answer: Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223, so Jochi could not have made an alliance with him.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Yinchuan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: hunting", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the weapon that caused Genghis Khan's death, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 3 tells us that different concepts such as age and weapons should not be confused. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if one source claims that Genghis Khan died from a battle wound, and another source claims that he died from falling off his horse, we should consider both possibilities and choose the one that is more likely. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, which means that we need to pay attention to the fact that Marco Polo did not report a specific weapon as the cause of Genghis Khan's death. \nThe answer: Marco Polo did not report a specific weapon as the cause of Genghis Khan's death.", "{3, 8, 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the empire that is implicated in Genghis Khan's death. Rule 3 is relevant to ensure that the answer is not confused with any other concept. Rule 8 is relevant because the question contains the word \"implicate,\" which implies a negative connotation. Rule 12 is relevant to ignore irrelevant information. Rule 13 is relevant to ensure that names are important for the answer. Rule 17 is relevant to consider negations in the question. \nThe answer: Western Xia", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the rival of the Mongols who is suspected of inventing the story of Genghis Khan's murder by a captured princess. This information is found in the last sentence of the passage, which contains a negation (\"some Mongol authors have doubted this version\") and a reference to a rival group (\"invention by the rival Oirads\"). Therefore, relevant rules include 3 (different concepts), 7 (synonyms), 12 (irrelevant passages), and 17 (negations). \nThe answer: Oirads", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan asked to be buried without markings, according to the customs of his tribe.\nThe answer: to be buried without markings.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan's body was returned to Mongolia and presumably to his birthplace in Khentii Aimag, according to the article. \"Presumed\" indicates uncertainty, so we use rule 13 to include names as equally important for the answer. We also use rule 16 to determine that \"delivered\" should be interpreted as \"buried\".\nThe answer: Khentii Aimag", "{3, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about Genghis Khan's burial place and mentions the Onon River as being close to his likely burial site. We can use rule 3 to determine that the river is a different concept than Genghis Khan's burial place. Rule 12 tells us to ignore irrelevant information in the passage, such as the legend about the funeral escort killing anyone in their path. Rule 13 tells us that names and locations are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Onon River", "{rule list: 1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that Genghis Khan was buried without markings, indicating that his burial site was not meant to be easily identifiable. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about a memorial, which is a different concept from a burial site. Rule 16 applies because the article mentions that the mausoleum was constructed many years after his death. \nThe answer: Genghis Khan Mausoleum", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"In 1939 Chinese Nationalist soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: Edsen Khoroo) in Mongolia.\" The Mongolian name for the original place of the Genghis Khan mausoleum is Edsen Khoroo.\nThe answer: Edsen Khoroo", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the Buddhist monastery that hosted the Genghis Khan mausoleum during the Japanese occupation. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A took a position from B, then B lost that position to A. Rule 2 applies because it states that if A is very/most X and B is somewhat/least X, then A is most/least X and B is least/most X. Rule 13 applies because it states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Dongshan Dafo Dian", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the mausoleum was taken through Communist-held territory, implying that the Nationalist soldiers were retreating from Communist forces. Rule 16 applies because the article provides a chronological sequence of events, with the mausoleum being moved first to a Buddhist monastery and then to Kumbum Monastery. Rule 23 applies because the article uses passive voice to describe the return of Genghis Khan's bier and relics to Mongolia. \nThe answer: Communist-held territory in Yan'an", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes a sequence of events, with the mausoleum being moved from one location to another. The question asks for a specific time when it was returned to its original location. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the answer will be the earliest date mentioned in the passage. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" which means that we need to look for a sentence in the passive voice that describes the mausoleum being returned. The sentence \"In early 1954, Genghis Khan's bier and relics were returned to the Lord's Enclosure in Mongolia\" fits both of these criteria. \nThe answer: early 1954", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who destroyed the relics in the mausoleum during the Cultural Revolution. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts such as age and actions are different, so we need to pay attention to who performed the action. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that whoever destroyed the relics did not value their worth. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a statement that indicates who did not destroy the relics. \nThe answer: Red Guards", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the date when Genghis Khan's palace was rediscovered by archaeologists. The passage provides the exact date, which is October 6, 2004. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"rediscovered\"), which is important for understanding what is being asked. Rule 22 is also relevant because the passage mentions folklore and other tales about Genghis Khan's burial site, but the question specifically asks about the rediscovery of his palace. \nThe answer: October 6, 2004.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that folklore says a river was diverted over his grave to make it impossible to find. This implies that the water body obscuring Genghis Khan's burial site is a river.\nThe answer: river", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Genghis Khan's burial site was hidden in the same manner as Sumerian King Gilgamesh of Uruk and Atilla the Hun. \nThe answer: Sumerian King Gilgamesh of Uruk and Atilla the Hun.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the animals that may have been stampeded over Genghis Khan's grave site, which is mentioned in the passage as a part of folklore. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the type of animals is not relevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"animals\" can be replaced with \"horses\" from the passage. \nThe answer: horses.", "{rule list: 16, 13, 12, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military code, called the Yassa, created by Genghis Khan.\" Rule 16 helps us identify that the subject of the sentence is Genghis Khan. Rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify \"created the Yassa\" as Genghis Khan's profession. \nThe answer: Genghis Khan", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a comparison between the Yassa and other legal codes. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the name of the legal code and other aspects of the Mongol Empire. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the name of the legal code comes after the description of the Mongol Empire. \nThe answer: Yassa", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The Yassa, the code of conduct for the Mongol Empire, was based on meritocracy rather than ethnicity or race. This is in line with rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. It is also in line with rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Finally, rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer, is relevant because the question asks for the guiding principle, which is a negation of what the code did not emphasize. \nThe answer: meritocracy", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that the Mongol Empire adopted a meritocratic approach and did not emphasize ethnicity and race in the administrative realm, except for Genghis Khan and his family. Therefore, Genghis Khan and his family were exempt from the meritocratic principles.\nThe answer: Genghis Khan and his family.", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Mongol Empire was ethnically diverse and included leaders of various ethnicities. Therefore, the answer should be a leader who is not necessarily Mongol. Rule 3 states that ethnicity is a different concept from other concepts such as profession or nationality. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Muhammad Khan.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that there were tax exemptions for religious figures, teachers, and doctors in the Mongol Empire. This indicates that these professions were given some sort of special treatment or benefit. The rules of 3 and 4 are relevant because they establish that profession and religion are different concepts, and that tax exemptions for religious figures do not necessarily apply to other professions. \nThe answer: Tax exemptions", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Ong Khan", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the Mongol Empire practiced religious tolerance, which means that no one religion was given more power than another. Rule 3 applies because the article mentions that various Mongol tribes followed different religions. Rule 17 applies because the article mentions that religion was considered a personal concept and not subject to interference. \nThe answer: The Mongol Empire practiced religious tolerance and considered religion a personal concept not subject to interference.", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist, or Christian.\nThe answer: Shamanist, Buddhist, or Christian.", "{4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: Rule 4 separates profession and nationality, so we know that the answer will not include any information about the woman's nationality. Rule 16 tells us that we should prioritize the order of events, so we know that the woman in question took a leadership role before a male Khagan was chosen. Rule 20 tells us that \"she\" refers to a female name, so we can identify the woman in question as T\u00f6regene Khatun.\nThe answer: T\u00f6regene Khatun", "{3, 7, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a modern term for a policy that supported trade and communication in the Mongol Empire. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about women's role in the empire. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for a synonym for \"policy\" and \"supporting trade and communication.\" Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any specific names or terms mentioned. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative statements. \nThe answer: Pax Mongolica", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, such as discriminatory policies. Rule 4 states that nationality is a different concept from discriminatory policies. Rule 8 states that if one entity is more favored than another, then the other entity is less favored than the first entity. Therefore, the answer is sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. \nThe answer: Chinese", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: establish the legal equality of all individuals, including women", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a person's name and profession. Rule 3 states that age, shape, size, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so nationality is not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3, 4, and 13.\nThe answer: Chu'Tsai", "{3, 19}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that being a nomad is a different concept from having experience governing cities. Therefore, the Mongols, who were nomads, would not have experience governing cities they conquered. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so it is not relevant whether the Mongols were male or female. \nThe answer: Because they were nomads and had no experience governing cities.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the dynasty that Genghis Khan defeated, which is a different concept from the Khitan dynasty that he mentions in the passage. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, but this is not relevant to the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that Genghis Khan avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers, implying that the Khitan dynasty was overthrown by the Jin dynasty. Therefore, the answer is the Jin dynasty. \nThe answer: Jin dynasty", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and negations are important for the answer (rule 17). The passage states that Genghis Khan told Chu'Tsai that he had avenged his forefathers, so the answer is Chu'Tsai's forefathers. \nThe answer: Chu'Tsai's forefathers.", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for someone who shared privileges with Genghis Khan's close family members, implying that they had similar privileges. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for a subject, which is a different concept from profession or nationality. Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a specific person. \nThe answer: Genghis Khan's generals, such as Muqali, Jebe, and Subutai.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Mongol Empire's capital was Karakorum.\nThe answer: Karakorum", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Muqali", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the two generals who raided the Caucasus and Kievan Rus' for Genghis Khan. Rule 1 tells us that if A did X and B did more X, then B did X more than A. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the generals' nationality. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we need to identify the two generals mentioned last in the passage. The answer is Subutai and Jebe. \nThe answer: Subutai and Jebe.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: unwavering loyalty", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: certain rivers", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Mongol military adopted new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer mentions a tactic called \"feigned retreat\" which means that the Mongol army pretended to retreat in order to lure small enemy groups away from their larger group and defended position for ambush and counterattack. This is an example of a negation (not a real retreat) and a comparison (small enemy groups vs larger group and defended position). \nThe answer: by using a feigned retreat tactic.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: driving them in front of the army", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the Sea of Japan was the eastern border of Genghis Khan's empire when he died. \nThe answer: Sea of Japan.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and location are different concepts tells us that the answer is not related to the shape of the Mongol Empire, but rather its location. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" tells us that the Caspian Sea was to the west of the Mongol Empire when Genghis Khan died.\nThe answer: Caspian Sea", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the leader who led the most rapid expansion of the Mongol Empire, which implies a comparison between different leaders. Rule 1 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can rephrase the question as \"Which leader led the fastest expansion of the Mongol Empire?\" Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, we can infer that the leader who led the fastest expansion of the Mongol Empire is the one who is mentioned as leading the \"speed of expansion reached its peak.\" \nThe answer: \u00d6gedei Khan", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the war with the Song dynasty lasted until 1279 and concluded with the Mongols gaining control of all of China.\nThe answer: 1279", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a stable political climate, which implies that there was instability before. Rule 3 applies because the answer refers to a trading route, which is a different concept from political environment. Rule 13 applies because the answer refers to a specific name and title. \nThe answer: Silk Road", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 20, 21}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan's title is a popular name for male children in Turkey, a country located in Asia and not in the Middle East. The answer is \"Turkey.\"\nThe answer: Turkey", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts of religion and communication/trade. Rule 4 separates concepts of profession and nationality. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Genghis Khan was tolerant of religions.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that Genghis Khan's unification of the Silk Road allowed for increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East, and Asia. This implies that before his rule, communication and trade were less cohesive and more difficult. Therefore, Genghis Khan's career had a positive effect on communication and trade across Asia.\nThe answer: increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East, and Asia", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that in the early 1990s, there was a powerful revival of Genghis Khan's memory with the Mongolian national identity. This implies that there was a previous period where his memory was not as bright. The rule that applies is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Therefore, the answer is the early 1990s. \n\nThe answer: early 1990s", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the key accomplishment of Genghis Khan that modern Mongolians celebrate. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps us understand that if Genghis Khan is celebrated for being more X than others, then others are less X than him. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that different concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are not interchangeable. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 5 is relevant because it reminds us that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Rule 7 is relevant because it reminds us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Genghis Khan's role in uniting warring tribes.", "{3, 8, 12, 20}\nExplanation: We need to identify how Mongolians describe their relationship to Genghis Khan. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as age and color are different, so we can ignore them. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if Mongolians maintain that Genghis Khan's brutality is exaggerated, then they describe their relationship to him positively. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about the historical records. Rule 20 tells us that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can infer that \"father of the Mongols\" refers to Genghis Khan. \nThe answer: Mongolians sometimes describe themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\" and their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", and refer to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\".", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks what non-Mongolian historians exaggerate about Genghis Khan, so we can infer that Mongolians believe that non-Mongolian historians exaggerate something negative about him. Rule 17 is also relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks what non-Mongolian historians exaggerate, so we can infer that Mongolians believe that non-Mongolian historians exaggerate something negative about Genghis Khan. \nThe answer: his butchery", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks about the perception of non-Mongolian histories, implying that there may be a difference in perception between Mongolian and non-Mongolian sources. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the passage states that Mongolians believe non-Mongolian records are biased against Genghis Khan, implying a negative perception. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also relevant because it is not related to the question. \nThe answer: Mongolians maintain that non-Mongolian records are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the denominations of Mongolian t\u00f6gr\u00f6g, which is the currency of Mongolia.\nThe answer: Mongolian t\u00f6gr\u00f6g", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can't assume that the larger denominations of Mongolian currency have a larger size. The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we know that the answer will be a name. Therefore, the answer is Genghis Khan. \nThe answer: Genghis Khan", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of Mongolia's largest airport, which is a specific piece of information that can be directly extracted from the passage. Rule 3 reminds us that size and name are different concepts, so we should focus on the mention of the airport's name. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Chinggis Khaan International Airport.", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding the reason why Mongolian politicians have considered regulating the use of Genghis Khan's name. This involves identifying a negative aspect associated with the widespread use of his name and image. Rules 3 and 7 remind us that concepts such as color and age are not relevant to the answer, and that questions may contain synonyms. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. The answer is that there have been discussions about regulating the use of his name and image to avoid trivialization.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that a major statue of Genghis Khan has been erected near Ulaanbaatar.\nThe answer: Ulaanbaatar", "{3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the name of the first written Mongolian law, which is mentioned in the passage as the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration). Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of language and law. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of names in the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Ikh Zasag (Great Administration)", "{3, 4, 8, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from profession and nationality, so rule 3 applies. The passage mentions the Mongolian President, which indicates that names are important for the answer, so rule 13 applies. The question asks about what was significantly punished by Genghis Khan's laws, which implies a negation, so rule 8 applies. The answer: illegal matters related to corruption and bribery.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Genghis Khan is credited with the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. This indicates that Genghis Khan innovated the Mongolian script.\nThe answer: The introduction of the traditional Mongolian script.", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the location in China where Genghis Khan is viewed most positively. Rule 13 tells us that names and locations are important for the answer. Rule 3 tells us that concepts like size, shape, age, and color are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts and not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Inner Mongolia region", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Inner Mongolia region has a population of around 5 million, almost twice the population of Mongolia.\nThe answer: around 5 million", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the descendant of Genghis Khan who completed the conquest of China and reunified it. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about their profession. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the grandson of Genghis Khan as Kublai Khan. \nThe answer: Kublai Khan", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kublai Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson, completed the conquest of China and established the Yuan dynasty. Therefore, the answer is Yuan. \nThe answer: Yuan", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Kublai Khan was Genghis Khan's grandson.\nThe answer: Grandson", "{3, 8, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"in the Middle East, and particularly in Iran, Genghis Khan is almost universally condemned as a destructive and genocidal warlord.\" This indicates that Iran is the Middle Eastern nation in particular that views Genghis Khan as a contemptible perpetrator of genocide.\nThe answer: Iran", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the proportion of the population killed by Genghis Khan in the area that became Iran. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the passage states that up to three-fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau was killed, which means that one-fourth or less survived. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the population killed is not the same as the population that survived. Rule 8 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the proportion killed, which is the opposite of the proportion that survived. \nThe answer: up to three-fourths (or 75%) of the population was killed.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan is described as a \"destructive and genocidal warlord\" who caused \"enormous damage and destruction\" to the population of the Iranian Plateau. Historians estimate that his violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population, possibly 10 to 15 million people. Therefore, the answer is \"10 to 15 million\".", "{rule list: 1, 2, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the descendant of Genghis Khan who sacked Baghdad. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps to understand that if A sacked B, then B was sacked by A. Rule 2 is relevant because it helps to understand that if A is a descendant of Genghis Khan and sacked Baghdad, then A is the most likely answer to the question. Rule 13 is relevant because names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Hulagu Khan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Mamluks of Egypt", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific descendant of Genghis Khan who pushed the Mamluks out of Palestine. Rule 1 tells us that if A caused more of X than B, then B caused less of X than A. Rule 3 tells us that concepts like size, shape, age, and color are different and cannot be compared. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 5 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Rule 6 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer.

Rule 21 tells us that \"", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule about \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Genghis Khan is the grandfather of Batu Khan. The rule about \"age\" is not relevant here since the year is explicitly mentioned.\nThe answer: 1237", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that shape is a different concept from size is irrelevant to the question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because the question asks specifically about which cities were not destroyed, implying that some were. The answer is Novgorod and Pskov. \nThe answer: Novgorod and Pskov.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Mughal emperors, who were descendants of Genghis Khan and Timur, distanced themselves from the Mongol atrocities committed against various Muslim populations in the Middle East. This implies that the Mughal emperors tried to dissociate themselves from the Mongol massacres.\nThe answer: Mughal emperors", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the Mughal emperors distanced themselves from the Mongol atrocities, they were not celebrating Genghis Khan's conquests. Therefore, the answer is Timur. \nThe answer: Timur.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Nishapur", "{1, 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the Mongolian word that may have contributed to the name Genghis. Rule 1 helps us understand that \"wide-spreading\" is a characteristic of the word, not a comparison. Rule 3 reminds us that size and shape are different concepts, so we can eliminate \"ocean\" and \"oceanic\". Rule 7 tells us that synonyms may be used in the question, so \"wide-spreading\" could be replaced with \"spreading widely\". Finally, rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the Mongolian word that may have contributed to the name Genghis. \nThe answer: tenggis", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Lake Baikal and ocean were called tenggis by the Mongols. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so the fact that Lake Baikal is massive is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that synonyms from the context paragraph may be used in the question, so \"massive lake\" can be replaced with \"Lake Baikal\". Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored, so the fact that the passage discusses the origin of Genghis Khan's name is not important. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that the question asks for the name the Mongolians called the lake is relevant. \nThe answer: tenggis", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The rule that \"definitions of words are important for answering questions\" (rule 3) applies here, as well as the rule that \"irrelevant passages should be ignored\" (rule 12). \nThe answer: \"right\", \"just\", or \"true\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"words for size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the passage explains that \"Jenggis\" is the adjectival form of a word meaning \"right\", \"just\", or \"true\". Therefore, the antonym of \"Jenggis\" would be \"wrong\", \"unjust\", or \"false\". \nThe answer: \"Jenggis\" is the adjectival form of the word meaning \"right\", \"just\", or \"true\".", "{rule list: 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the spelling of Genghis that most closely matches its probable pronunciation. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, but it is important to note that the spelling of Genghis in the question is correct. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, but it is important to note that the passage provides information about the origin of the name and the probable pronunciation. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in the question or passage. \nThe answer: Chinggis", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that names are equally important for the answer applies because the question specifically asks for the Mongolian spelling of Genghis Khan. The rule that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts does not apply because none of these concepts are relevant to the question.\nThe answer: Chinggis Khaan", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan is a title that is spelled in various ways in different languages. The question specifically asks for the spelling in Turkic, which is covered by rule 4. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, but since there is only one name/title mentioned in the question, this rule is not relevant.\nThe answer: Cengiz Han", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying how Tem\u00fcjin is written in pinyin, which is a system of romanization for Mandarin Chinese. Therefore, rule 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) are not relevant. The answer can be found in the passage, which states that Tem\u00fcjin is written in pinyin as \"Ti\u011bm\u00f9zh\u0113n.\"\nThe answer: Ti\u011bm\u00f9zh\u0113n", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question.

The original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. Therefore, the answer is \"pharma\". \nThe answer: pharma", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is related to the pharma's nationality. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is related to the physical appearance of the pharma. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is related to any type of transportation.

The answer is that it would be seen as outdated or only appropriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that pharmas used \"many other herbs not listed.\" This implies that in addition to the herbs listed, there were other substances used by pharmas.\nThe answer: Other herbs", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Pharmacists are a type of healthcare professional who specialize in the use of medicines to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients. \nThe answer: healthcare professionals", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Pharmacists aim for optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines.\nThe answer: optimal health outcomes", "{3, 4, 19}\nExplanation: Pharmacists are important for the optimization of drug treatment for an individual.\nThe answer: drug treatment", "{4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that pharmacists may also be small-business proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. This falls under the category of profession, which is a different concept from nationality and animals/vehicles. Additionally, the fact that pharmacists may own their own pharmacy is relevant information, as it highlights another role they may play. Therefore, rules 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 5 (animals and vehicles are different concepts), and 13 (names are equally important for the answer) are relevant. \nThe answer: small-business proprietors/owning a pharmacy", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Pharmacists have specialised education and training.\nThe answer: specialised education and training", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians, and does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy).

Additionally, the article mentions that a pharmacy technician must register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register, which suggests that they have professional responsibilities. Finally, the article states that a pharmacy technician does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians, which implies that they have some level of responsibility in their work. \nThe answer: managerial, professional, and supervisory responsibilities", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Pedanius Dioscorides is known for writing a five volume book on the medicinal properties of plants, which was translated into Latin as De Materia Medica and used as a basis for many medieval texts. \nThe answer: Writing a book on the medicinal properties of plants", "{3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the book written by Pedanius Dioscorides, which was originally written in Greek and later translated into Latin. The passage also mentions the title of the Latin translation, \"De Materia Medica.\" Negations are important for the answer because the question asks for the name of the translation, not the original Greek title. \nThe answer: De Materia Medica", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Dioscorides' book \"coined the term materia medica.\"\nThe answer: materia medica", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares two things (Diocles and other men studying medicinal properties of plants) and establishes a relationship between them. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between concepts (medicinal properties of plants and plants themselves). Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a specific person. \nThe answer: Diocles of Carystus.", "{4, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (4) is relevant because it helps us understand that the person who added to Dioscorides' book was likely a scientist from the Islamic Golden Age, rather than just someone from a particular nationality. The rule that names are equally important for the answer (13) is relevant because it tells us that we need to look for a specific person who added to the book. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first (16) is relevant because it helps us identify the time period in which the person added to the book. \nThe answer: middle eastern scientists", "{1, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes that the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected in Japan during the Asuka and Nara periods. This implies that they were viewed as important and valuable members of society. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and in this case, the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected, indicating that they were more respected than others. Rule 4 applies because profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is asking about how the men were viewed in their profession, not their nationality. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about how the men were viewed, and the passage states that they were assigned a status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists, indicating that they were viewed as more important than those in other health-related professions. \nThe answer: highly respected", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Taih\u014d Code (701) and Y\u014dr\u014d Code (718)", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how a hierarchical structure was established in Japan during the Asuka and Nara periods, with pharmacists being assigned a superior status to other health-related fields. This was defined in the Taih\u014d Code and Y\u014dr\u014d Code, and remained intact until the Meiji Restoration. Rule 1 applies because the passage describes the establishment of a strict class hierarchy. Rule 2 applies because the passage describes the pharmacists being assigned a superior status. Rule 3 applies because the passage distinguishes between different concepts such as pharmacists, physicians, and acupuncturists. Rule 4 applies because the passage distinguishes between profession and status. Rule 5 applies because the passage distinguishes between animals and health-related fields. Rule 6 applies because the passage distinguishes between animals and health-related fields. Rule 16 applies because the passage describes the establishment of a ranked position in the Imperial court. \nThe answer: The Taih\u014d Code and Y\u014dr\u014d Code", "{4, 13, 19}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts, the importance of names, and the irrelevance of a person's gender to their profession are relevant here. The passage states that in the pre-Heian Imperial court in Japan, pharmacists were assigned a status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists, and even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor. Therefore, pharmacists had a very high stature in the pre-Heian Imperial court.\nThe answer: Pharmacists were assigned a status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists, and even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: above them in rank", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks about the scientists who influenced the creation of pharmacology in medieval Islam. Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 are relevant because they establish that concepts such as botany, chemistry, and medicine are different and that professions and names are important for the answer. Rule 13 is also relevant because it establishes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, Sabur Ibn Sahl, Al-Biruni, and Avicenna.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a person who promoted the use of chemical compounds as medicines.

Therefore, the answer is Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi.\nThe answer: Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Al-Muwaffaq", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying two compounds that Al-Muwaffaq differentiated between. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Applying these rules, we can infer that Al-Muwaffaq differentiated between two compounds, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the date of a pharmacy in Croatia. The passage mentions that there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317. This means that the pharmacy dates back to at least 1317. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can focus on the date mentioned in the passage. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so we can assume that the Dubrovnik pharmacy is the oldest one mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: 1317", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions several old pharmacies in Europe, but the question specifically asks for the oldest one. The answer is stated to be located in the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy, which dates back to 1221, making it the oldest mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: Florence, Italy", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the medieval Esteve Pharmacy is now a museum.\nThe answer: museum", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Esteve Pharmacy in Ll\u00edvia, which is now a museum. The passage mentions that the museum has \"albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs.\" \nThe answer: albarellos, prescription books, antique drugs", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the year in which the oldest pharmacy was established, which is a matter of historical fact and not a comparison or subjective concept. The passage provides the answer by stating that the oldest pharmacy is claimed to have been set up in 1221 in the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy.\nThe answer: 1221", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation in most countries, which falls under the concept of profession. \nThe answer: pharmacy legislation", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients.\" This implies that pharmacy technicians were formerly limited to compounding/dispensing medications. \nThe answer: Compounding/dispensing medications.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage explains that pharmacy technicians are now spending more time dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues, while pharmacists spend more time communicating with patients. As a result, pharmacy technicians are becoming more dependent on automation to assist them in their new role. This applies the rule that irrelevant passages should be ignored and the rule that some professions are different concepts. \nThe answer: automation", "3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 19\nExplanation: Pharmacy technicians' new responsibilities involve dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues, which require communication skills and knowledge of medication storage and equipment. This is a change from their previous role of compounding and dispensing medications. Gender is irrelevant to their profession. \nThe answer: dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation which specifies requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc.\nThe answer: requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage explains that pharmacists in hospitals often gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. This indicates that they acquire more preparation through specialized training programs after completing their initial pharmacy education. \nThe answer: through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Clinical pharmacists specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.\nThe answer: various disciplines of pharmacy", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The job of a pharmacist is complex due to the specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and patient compliance issues. \nThe answer: Safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions)", "{3, 4, 5, 15}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a specific group of pharmacists, so rule 3 applies to ensure that size, shape, age, and color are not relevant concepts. Rule 4 applies to ensure that profession and nationality are not the same concept. Rule 5 applies to ensure that animals and vehicles are not the same concept. Rule 15 applies to ensure that pharmacists who seek additional education after pharmacy school are those who specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.\nThe answer: Clinical pharmacists", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital.\nThe answer: within the premises of the hospital", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: unit-dose or a single dose of medicine", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 12}\nExplanation: The passage discusses hospital pharmacies and their functions. It mentions that some hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. This means that some pharmacy functions are being outsourced to other companies. \nThe answer: high risk preparations and some other compounding functions", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety\" is a factor that makes it imperative for hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible. This implies that the consequences of not performing at a high level could be negative for patient care and safety. Therefore, rules 3 (concepts of size, shape, age, and color are different), 4 (profession and nationality are different), and 17 (negations are important for the answer) are relevant. \nThe answer: potential impact on patient-care outcomes and patient safety", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from profession and nationality. Hospital pharmacies stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting, which is an advantage. \nThe answer: Hospital pharmacies stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The first rule applies because the question asks for what the services provide, which implies that the services have a positive effect. The third rule applies because the question asks for a general concept, which is \"services,\" and not a specific aspect like \"direct patient care.\" \nThe answer: optimization of medication use, promotion of health, wellness, and disease prevention", "{4, 15}\nExplanation: The passage states that the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics, indicating that it originated from within the healthcare industry. This aligns with rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 15, which states that if someone had profession X but changed to profession Y, then they have profession Y. Therefore, the origin of clinical pharmacy is within the healthcare industry.\nThe answer: Within the healthcare industry.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: Clinical pharmacists collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals.\nThe answer: physicians and other healthcare professionals", "{4, 5, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of nationality being the answer. The rules that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" and \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminate irrelevant concepts. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" indicates that the word \"not\" should be considered. The answer: patient care rounds drug product selection.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: Clinical pharmacists work with patients in all healthcare settings, including hospitals and clinics. As healthcare professionals, they collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. \nThe answer: all healthcare settings, hospitals, and clinics", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the pharmacist is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of drug therapy, which implies that they are comparing different options and determining which is more suitable. Rule 3 applies because the duties listed involve creating a drug therapy plan, evaluating drug interactions and adverse reactions, and assessing patient allergies, which are all related to the concept of medication. \nThe answer: Creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The review process involves evaluating the appropriateness and efficacy of the drug therapy, monitoring for potential drug interactions and adverse reactions, and assessing patient drug allergies. If a medication is deemed inappropriate, it may not be dispensed or administered. If there are potential interactions or adverse reactions, the pharmacist may need to adjust the therapy plan. Therefore, the answer is: evaluating the appropriateness and efficacy of the drug therapy, monitoring for potential drug interactions and adverse reactions, and assessing patient drug allergies.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the components of drug therapy, which is mentioned in the passage as including drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy. The passage also mentions that the appropriateness and efficacy of the drug therapy must be evaluated, and potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and patient drug allergies must be monitored. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply. \nThe answer: drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy, as well as evaluation of appropriateness and efficacy, and monitoring for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and patient drug allergies.", "{3, 4, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The pharmacist must monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan. These factors are all related to the drugs being prescribed and their effects on the patient. Negations are important for this question as the question asks for \"other\" factors, implying that drug interactions, adverse reactions, and allergies are already known factors. \nThe answer: None specified, as the question does not provide a specific factor to look for.", "{3, 4, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the type of authority given to ambulatory care pharmacists in the U.S. federal health care system. This is a question about their profession and the specific context is within the U.S. federal health care system. Therefore, rules 3, 4, 5, and 16 are relevant. The answer is: full independent prescribing authority.", "{2, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that in some states such as North Carolina and New Mexico, pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority. Rule 2 applies because \"given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority\" means they have some level of prescriptive and diagnostic authority, but not necessarily full authority. Rule 4 applies because pharmacist clinicians are a profession, while states are a nationality. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for states where pharmacist clinicians have authority, so the negation \"not given prescriptive and diagnostic authority\" is important.\nThe answer: North Carolina and New Mexico", "{3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification.\" This is a clear statement of when the certification was approved.\nThe answer: 2011", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage mentions that the official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP.\nThe answer: Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist (with initials BCACP)", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts helps us to identify that the question is asking for entities, not professions. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts helps us to eliminate any potential confusion between entities. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: VA, Indian Health Service, NIH", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps us understand that medication regimen review is more important than dispensing drugs. The answer is: medication regimen review.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, which implies that this is where a majority of them tend to work.\nThe answer: nursing homes", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that consultant pharmacists in the United States often work for several large pharmacy management companies, including Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare, and PharMerica.\nThe answer: Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare, and PharMerica.", "{1, 4, 19}\nExplanation: The rules selected are 1 (comparative relationships), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 19 (a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession). These rules are relevant because they help us understand that consultant pharmacists are a profession and that they are increasingly working directly with patients, regardless of their gender. \nThe answer: Because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that the mention of community pharmacies, which are a type of profession, is not relevant to the question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first means that the mention of Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare, and PharMerica, which are listed after the mention of consultant pharmacists, is also not relevant to the question. Therefore, the answer is: provide consulting services.", "{rule list: 10, 12}\nExplanation: The article states \"Since about the year 2000, a growing number of Internet pharmacies have been established worldwide.\"\nThe answer: about the year 2000", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that many internet pharmacies are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies. This falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Brick-and-mortar community pharmacies.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a synonym for \"internet pharmacies.\" Rule 3 states that synonyms are not equivalent concepts, so we cannot use that rule. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can use that rule to determine that \"online pharmacies\" is a synonym for \"internet pharmacies.\"\nThe answer: online pharmacies", "{1, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The article discusses how some customers find internet pharmacies to be a more convenient and private method of obtaining medication compared to going to a physical pharmacy where others may overhear about their medications. This aligns with rule 1, which states that if A is more convenient than B, then B is less convenient than A. Rule 4 also applies as profession and location are different concepts, and rule 7 applies as the question asks for a reason a patient might choose an internet pharmacy, which is synonymous with \"why would a patient prefer an internet pharmacy?\" The answer is: for convenience and privacy.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The third rule states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while the eighth rule states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the main difference between online pharmacies and community pharmacies is not related to size, shape, age, or color, but rather to the method by which medications are requested and received. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to eliminate those concepts and rule 8 to understand that the main difference is that online pharmacies use a different method than community pharmacies. \nThe answer: The method by which medications are requested and received.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to avoid the \"inconvenience\" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for who has criticized the practice of ordering from online pharmacies that don't require prescriptions. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the critic is a doctor. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for negative language in the passage. The passage states that this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, so the answer is: unspecified critics. \n\nThe answer: unspecified critics", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the criticism is that online pharmacies that issue drugs without a prescription are potentially dangerous, so the antonym of \"dangerous\" is \"safe\". Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The criticism is that online pharmacies that issue drugs without a prescription are potentially dangerous, so the answer is that they are not safe. \nThe answer: They are potentially dangerous.", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what most internet pharmacies do (sell prescription drugs with a valid prescription). Rule 7 applies because \"practice\" is a synonym for \"behavior\" or \"action\". Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negative answer (\"what do some internet pharmacies NOT require\"). \nThe answer: Some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that \"most Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription,\" implying that there are some that do not. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about what \"most online pharmacies\" do, which is a question about their general behavior rather than specific details like size, shape, age, or color. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"most,\" which implies that there may be exceptions. \nThe answer: sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription.", "{1, 3, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the ease with which people, particularly youth, can obtain controlled substances without a valid prescription or doctor-patient relationship through internet pharmacies. This is a problem because it can lead to misuse and abuse of these substances. \nThe answer: the ease with which people can obtain controlled substances without a valid prescription or doctor-patient relationship", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is about the conditions that must be met for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid. Rule 3 and 4 are relevant because they distinguish between concepts such as controlled substances and legitimate medical purposes, and between licensed practitioners and filling pharmacies. Rule 8 is relevant because it specifies that if a prescription is not valid, it is because it does not meet certain conditions. Rule 17 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: It must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship.", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a problem with internet pharmacies. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps to understand that the problem is a negative aspect of internet pharmacies. Rule 3 is relevant because it helps to distinguish the problem from other concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 4 is relevant because it helps to distinguish the problem from nationality and other professions. Rule 5 is relevant because it helps to distinguish the problem from animals and vehicles. Rule 6 is relevant because it helps to distinguish the problem from animals and vehicles. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms in the question. Rule 8 is relevant because it helps to understand that the problem is a negative aspect of internet pharmacies. Rule 17 is relevant because it helps to identify the negative aspect of internet pharmacies as the ease with which people can obtain controlled substances without a valid prescription. \nThe answer: The ease with which people can obtain controlled substances without a valid prescription.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer refers to the conditions that must be met to prescribe a controlled substance. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"conditions\" are different from concepts such as \"profession\" or \"nationality.\" Rule 4 states that professions are different from nationalities. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is that a prescription for a controlled substance must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of a legitimate doctor-patient relationship.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid.\" This implies that the obligation of a pharmacy filling a prescription is to ensure that the prescription is valid.\nThe answer: to ensure that the prescription is valid.", "{rule list: 4, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship.\" This means that the definition of a patient-doctor relationship is defined by individual state laws.\nThe answer: individual state laws", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"controlled substances (e.g., Vicodin, generically known as hydrocodone).\" This means that Vicodin/hydrocodone is an example of a controlled substance.\nThe answer: Vicodin/hydrocodone", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a reason for the movement to legalize importing medicines from other countries. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that importing medications from other countries can reduce consumer costs, which implies that the cost of medications in the US is higher than in other countries. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the reason for the movement to legalize importing medications is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 7 applies because the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means that the answer may not be an exact match to the question. Rule 17 applies because negations are important for the answer, and the question asks for a reason for the movement to legalize importing medicines, which implies that it is currently illegal. \nThe answer: to reduce consumer costs", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a country that has been suggested for importation of medicines. The article mentions Canada as one of the countries that the United States has been pushing to legalize importation of medications from. \nThe answer: Canada.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks who the FDA laws are aimed at, implying that the laws are not aimed at consumers. Therefore, the answer is that the FDA laws against importing medications are aimed at international drug suppliers. \nThe answer: international drug suppliers", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking if anyone has been charged with importing drugs from Canada for personal medicinal use. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about these concepts in the article is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article states that no one has been charged, then the answer is that no one has been charged. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that there is \"no known case\" of anyone being charged is relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: No, there is no known case of anyone being charged.", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for something that is being pushed for in the U.S. to reduce consumer drug costs. The relevant information in the article is that there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from Canada and other countries. Rule 1 applies because \"legalizing importation of medications\" means that the U.S. currently does not allow it, so it is the opposite of \"violates FDA regulations and federal laws.\" Rule 7 applies because \"legalizing importation of medications\" is a synonym for \"push to legalize importation of medications.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks for something that is being pushed for, which is a negation. \nThe answer: Legalizing importation of medications from Canada and other countries.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because pharmacy practice science and applied information science are being compared and combined. The rule 4 applies because pharmacy practice science and applied information science are different concepts.\nThe answer: pharmacy practice science and applied information science", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Pharmacy informatics may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies.\nThe answer: information technology and healthcare information technology vendor companies.", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rules selected are 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph). These rules are relevant because they help to clarify that the growth in pharmacy informatics will meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals, rather than the needs of a specific group of people or profession. \nThe answer: the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13}\nExplanation: Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies.\nThe answer: pharmacy practice areas, information technology departments, healthcare information technology vendor companies", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Pharmacy informatics is described as \"growing quickly\" which indicates a high rate of growth. Rule 2 applies because \"quickly\" is a synonym for \"fast.\" Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the degree of growth, which can be expressed as the rate of growth.\nThe answer: quickly", "{1, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage compares specialty pharmacies to traditional community pharmacies and highlights the unique services provided by specialty pharmacies. The question asks for the fastest growing area in the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is related to specialty pharmacies. The relevant rules are 1 (comparing growth rates), 4 (distinguishing between different concepts), and 7 (using synonyms from the context). \nThe answer: specialty pharmacies", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of drugs approved by the FDA in 2013 that were specialty drugs, which is a specific subset of all drugs approved by the FDA in that year.\nThe answer: 19", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Specialty drugs are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe answer: cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Specialty pharmacies stock high cost injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. They do not stock common medications that can be filled at a traditional community pharmacy.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Specialty pharmacies provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs.\nThe answer: lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and cost-containment strategies", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: Pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians in most jurisdictions, as specified in rule 4. This is in contrast to physicians, who are regulated separately from pharmacists. The use of \"separately\" implies that the two professions are distinct and not interchangeable. Rule 8 also applies, as it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, pharmacists are more regulated than physicians, so physicians are less regulated than pharmacists.\nThe answer: Pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians, and only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public. \nThe answer: pharmacists", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Ethics has stated that physicians can dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere.\nThe answer: American Medical Association (AMA)", "{rule list: 1, 2, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that \"7 to 10 percent of American physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own.\" Rule 1 applies because \"7 to 10 percent\" implies that some physicians do not dispense drugs on their own. Rule 2 applies because \"reportedly\" suggests that the estimate may not be exact. Rule 16 applies because the estimate is given as a range, with 7% being the lower bound and 10% being the upper bound.\nThe answer: 7 to 10 percent", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Pharmacists cannot form business partnerships with physicians or give them \"kickback\" payments.\nThe answer: Form business partnerships with physicians or give them \"kickback\" payments.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for another country that permits physicians to give out drugs from within their practice, implying that the UK is one such country. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the UK is mentioned as a country where this practice exists does not preclude the possibility of other countries having the same practice. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the UK permits this practice, then there must be other countries where it is also permitted. \nThe answer: Austria", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage describes dispensing physicians in rural areas of the UK who are allowed to prescribe and dispense medication to their patients from within their practices. This is a specific exception to the general rule that prescriptions must be filled at a retail pharmacy. Therefore, rule 1 applies to clarify that the dispensing physicians are able to do this because they are located in rural areas and there is a minimum distance requirement between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy. Rule 3 applies to emphasize that the concept of dispensing physicians is distinct from the concept of retail pharmacies. Rule 4 applies to clarify that the location of the physician's practice is not necessarily tied to their nationality. \nThe answer: in designated rural areas in the United Kingdom", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that there is a \"specified, minimum distance (currently 1.6 kilometres) between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy\" required for dispensing physicians to be allowed to prescribe and dispense medication. This means that if the distance is less than 1.6 kilometers, the physician cannot give out medication. The relevant rules are 3 and 8, which state that distance is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: 1.6 kilometers", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that in Austria, dispensing physicians are allowed to give out medicine if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away. This implies that the minimum distance between a patient's home and the nearest pharmacy is 4 kilometers.\nThe answer: 4 kilometers", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to avoid conflicts of interest and the physician's financial self-interest in selling more medications.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If a physician diagnoses a large number of conditions, they may have a financial self-interest in doing so, as they can then sell more medications to the patient. This conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding unnecessary medication with side-effects. \nThe answer: To sell more medications to the patient.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article discusses how a conflict of interest arises when a physician has a financial self-interest in diagnosing as many conditions as possible, which conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about what the rules about conflict of interest involving doctors diagnosing patients resemble, implying that there is a comparison being made. \nThe answer: The rules about conflict of interest involving doctors diagnosing patients resemble the concept of checks and balances in government.", "{1, 3, 5, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if a physician has a financial self-interest in diagnosing as many conditions as possible, then they would have a financial self-interest in avoiding diagnosing as few conditions as possible. Rule 3 applies because financial self-interest is a different concept than the actual diagnosis of medical conditions. Rule 5 applies because physicians and medications are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for another way a physician might take advantage of self-interest, implying that one way has already been mentioned. \nThe answer: Exaggerating the seriousness of conditions to sell more medications to the patient.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the doctor's financial self-interest conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication. Rule 2 applies because the doctor's interest in selling more medications conflicts with the patient's interest in avoiding unnecessary medication with side-effects. Rule 3 applies because the concepts of financial self-interest and cost-effective medication are different. Rule 4 applies because the doctor's profession and the patient's nationality are different concepts. Rule 5 applies because the doctor and the patient are different entities than animals or vehicles. Rule 6 applies because the doctor and the patient are different entities than animals or vehicles. Rule 7 applies because \"self-interest\" is a synonym for \"financial interest\". Rule 8 applies because the doctor's financial self-interest conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication. Rule 17 applies because the question asks where the doctor's self-interest is at odds with the patient's self-interest. \nThe answer: in \"diagnosing\" as many conditions as possible and in exaggerating their seriousness, because he or", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system and that they are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills. This implies that their profession will become more important and valued in the future. \nThe answer: Pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system and are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills, specifically through Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services. This implies that pharmacists are taking on more patient care responsibilities in addition to dispensing medication. \nThe answer: patient care skills", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Medication Therapy Management includes the thorough analysis of all medication currently being taken by an individual, including prescription, non-prescription, and herbals. \nThe answer: the analysis of all medication currently being taken by an individual, including prescription, non-prescription, and herbals.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article discusses how pharmacists are expected to provide clinical services in addition to dispensing medication, specifically mentioning Medication Therapy Management (MTM) as an example. The article goes on to explain that these services include analyzing all medication currently being taken by a patient and providing patient education, resulting in improved health outcomes and decreased costs to the healthcare system. Therefore, the answer is: analyzing all medication currently being taken by an individual and patient education.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the question asks about the expected outcomes of Medication Therapy Management, implying that it is more beneficial than not having it. The rule 3 applies because the question asks about the specific outcomes, not about the size, shape, age, or color of Medication Therapy Management.\nThe answer: increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.", "{2, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for which provinces limit the rights of pharmacists in prescribing, which is a profession-related concept. Therefore, rule 4 applies. The question also contains the word \"limit,\" which is an antonym of \"expanded,\" so rule 8 applies. The answer is Alberta and British Columbia. \nThe answer: Alberta and British Columbia.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about who pays the pharmacists, which is the opposite of receiving remuneration. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about a specific country. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about who pays, which is a negation. \nThe answer: Australian Government", "{rule list: 2, 4}\nExplanation: Pharmacists in the United Kingdom are being increasingly paid for medicine use reviews and obtaining prescribing rights due to additional training. This is because of pharmacy education. \nThe answer: medicine use reviews and obtaining prescribing rights", "{4, 15}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that we can infer that \"fields\" refers to areas of expertise or practice within the pharmacy profession. The rule that if someone had profession X but changed to profession Y, then they have profession Y means that we can infer that consultant pharmacy is now considered a field within the pharmacy profession. \nThe answer: pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy and consultant pharmacy", "{16, 19}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the information in the last sentence of the passage is the most relevant to the question. The rule 19 states that \"a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession\", which means that the gender of the pharmacist is not important. \nThe answer: Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the two symbols commonly associated with pharmacy in English-speaking countries are the mortar and pestle and the \u211e (recipere) character. These are the only two symbols mentioned in the passage as being associated with pharmacy in English-speaking countries.\nThe answer: mortar and pestle and \u211e (recipere) character", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the show globe", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Bowl of Hygieia is often used in the Netherlands by pharmacy organizations. This information directly answers the question.\nThe answer: the Netherlands", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer will not be a country. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"pharmacy\" in the passage. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for specific country names. \nThe answer: Germany and Austria.", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is relevant because the question asks about which countries use a symbol for pharmacy. The rule that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph is relevant because the question uses the phrase \"symbol of pharmacy\" instead of \"symbols associated with pharmacy.\" The rule that names are equally important for the answer is not relevant because no specific names are mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The rules selected ensure that we focus on the definition of the immune system and avoid any irrelevant information. Rule 3 ensures that we don't confuse the immune system with other concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 4 ensures that we don't confuse the immune system with nationality or profession. Rule 5 ensures that we don't confuse the immune system with animals or vehicles. Rule 6 ensures that we don't confuse the immune system with animals or vehicles. Rule 17 ensures that we pay attention to negations in the question. \nThe answer: The immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The immune system protects against disease, which includes a wide variety of agents such as pathogens from viruses to parasitic worms. \nThe answer: disease", "3, 4\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. These rules are not relevant to this question. The relevant rules are 3 and 4, which state that the immune system can be classified into subsystems, and that subsystems are different concepts from each other. \nThe answer: innate immune system and adaptive immune system", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that in humans, the blood-brain barrier separates the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain. This indicates that there is a specific subsystem, the neuroimmune system, that protects the human brain.\nThe answer: The neuroimmune system.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The immune system is a system of biological structures and processes that protect against disease by detecting and distinguishing pathogens from healthy tissue. It can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate and adaptive immune systems, and is separated from the neuroimmune system by barriers in the body. \nThe answer: A system of biological structures and processes that protect against disease by detecting and distinguishing pathogens from healthy tissue.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The immune system protects against pathogens, which are agents that can cause disease. This is stated in the article. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: disease/pathogens", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the immune system can be classified into subsystems, including the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system and humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity.\nThe answer: innate immune system and adaptive immune system", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what the immune system protects against. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a different concept than the immune system itself.\nThe answer: disease", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\", which means that the answer cannot be any of these concepts. The passage states that the immune system detects \"agents\", which refers to pathogens such as viruses and parasitic worms.\nThe answer: pathogens", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the neuroimmune system protects the brain and is separate from the peripheral immune system. This implies that a specific part of the immune system protects the brain. Additionally, the sentence structure places the neuroimmune system as the latter of the two systems mentioned, following the peripheral immune system. \nThe answer: the neuroimmune system", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the blood-brain barrier and similar fluid-brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system in humans.\nThe answer: the blood-brain barrier and similar fluid-brain barriers", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of \"healthy tissue\", which is \"pathogens\". Rule 3 applies because \"agents\" and \"pathogens\" are different concepts. Rule 7 applies because \"agents\" is a synonym for \"pathogens\" in the context. \nThe answer: pathogens", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the immune system can be classified into subsystems, including the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system. This satisfies rule 3, which states that different concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts. \nThe answer: innate immune system and adaptive immune system", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions two different classifications of the immune system: innate vs adaptive and humoral vs cell-mediated. \nThe answer: The two different types of immunity are innate and adaptive, and humoral and cell-mediated.", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the immune system is divided into subsystems, and that there are barriers that separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system. Therefore, we can infer that the immune system of the brain is known as the neuroimmune system.\nThe answer: neuroimmune system", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because pathogens can evolve to be more difficult to detect by the immune system. Rule 3 applies because the concept of \"avoiding detection\" is different from size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, making it more difficult for the immune system to detect and neutralize them.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections.\nThe answer: rudimentary", "{3, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The passage explains that basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. Therefore, the answer is: plants and invertebrates. \nThe answer: plants and invertebrates", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: It creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections.\nThe answer: bacteriophages", "{3, 4, 5, 7}\nExplanation: The rules state that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts,\" \"profession and nationality are different concepts,\" and \"animals and vehicles are different concepts.\" These rules are not relevant to the question. Rule 7 states that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph,\" which is relevant because the question uses the synonym \"antimicrobial peptides\" instead of \"defensins.\" Therefore, the answer is \"defensins.\" \nThe answer: defensins", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: vaccination", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a term that describes the ability to recognize and adapt to new specific pathogens. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate those as potential answers. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article mentions \"adaptive (or acquired) immunity\" as a more sophisticated defense mechanism than the basic immune mechanisms found in unicellular organisms and ancient eukaryotes. Therefore, the answer is \"adaptive immunity\". \nThe answer: adaptive immunity", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancer.\nThe answer: autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancer.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because immunodeficiency is when the immune system is less active than normal, so it is less active than a normal immune system. Rule 3 applies because immunodeficiency is a different concept than autoimmunity. Rule 8 applies because if immunodeficiency occurs more in A than in B, then it occurs less in B than in A.\nThe answer: Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because immunodeficiency is a state where the immune system is less active than normal, making the person more susceptible to infections. Rule 3 applies because immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases are different concepts. \nThe answer: recurring and life-threatening infections.", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. If A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that one cause of immunodeficiency is a less active immune system than normal. Negations are important for the answer, so we can infer that the cause of immunodeficiency is not a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues. \nThe answer: a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication.", "{3, 4, 7, 13, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, profession and nationality are different concepts, and questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Names are equally important for the answer, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: rheumatoid arthritis", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of a situation where the immune system is more active than normal. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a description of a concept. \nThe answer: recurring and life-threatening infections", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be used to answer the question. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for the term for a hyperactive immune system, which is the opposite of a less active immune system. Rule 17 is also relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is autoimmunity. \n\nThe answer: autoimmunity", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The field of study mentioned in the passage is \"Immunology\".\nThe answer: Immunology", "{3, 5, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"diseases\" and \"medication\" are different concepts eliminates the possibility of autoimmune diseases being the answer. The rule that \"animals\" and \"humans\" are different concepts eliminates the possibility of animal immunodeficiency being the answer. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" allows us to infer that \"less active than normal\" is the antonym of \"more active than normal,\" which means that the answer is HIV/AIDS.\nThe answer: HIV/AIDS", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The plague of Athens in 430 BC.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Scorpion", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Louis Pasteur proposed the germ theory of disease, which was in opposition to contemporary theories of disease. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 (profession and concepts) are relevant, as well as rule 16 (first and last). \nThe answer: Louis Pasteur", "{rule list: 13, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that the Yellow Fever virus was discovered in 1901, and the discoverer's name is given as Walter Reed.\nThe answer: Walter Reed", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Robert Koch was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1905. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence \"for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905\" is a passive construction, and that Robert Koch is the subject who was awarded the prize. \nThe answer: Robert Koch", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: microorganisms", "{rule list: 3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses the history of immunology and the discovery of viruses as human pathogens. The question asks specifically about the virus discovered by Walter Reed. Therefore, we can apply rule 3 to understand that different viruses are different concepts. Rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer, so we should pay attention to the name \"Walter Reed\" in the passage. Finally, rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: yellow fever virus", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC, which is the first historical reference to immunity.\nThe answer: 430 BC", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify a synonym for the \"improved response\" of the immune system. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as \"size, shape, age, and color\" are different, so we can eliminate any rules related to those concepts. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"improved response\" in the article. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3, 7, and 17. \nThe answer: immunological memory", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that physical barriers are the first layer of defense in the immune system, so the system that comes after physical barriers is the innate immune system.\nThe answer: Innate immune system", "{3, 16, 24}\nExplanation: Rule 3 distinguishes between different concepts, including physical barriers, innate immune system, and adaptive immune system. Rule 16 establishes the order of the layered defenses, with the innate immune system providing the first layer of protection and the adaptive immune system providing the second layer. Rule 24 clarifies that the innate response comes before the adaptive response. \nThe answer: the adaptive immune system", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals.\" This means that both plants and animals have innate immune systems, which is a type of immune system that provides an immediate, but non-specific response to pathogens.\nThe answer: innate immune systems", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes two layers of defense in the immune system: the innate immune system, which provides an immediate but non-specific response, and the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response and adapts its response during an infection. The question specifically asks for the immune system that is activated by the innate response, which is the adaptive immune system.\nThe answer: the adaptive immune system", "{3, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is discussing the concept of immunological memory, which allows the adaptive immune system to recognize and respond more quickly and effectively to a pathogen that it has encountered before. This is a negation question, as it asks for what allows the system to react faster and more strongly, so rule 17 is relevant. Additionally, the answer is discussing a biological process, so rules 3 and 6 are relevant to ensure that size, shape, age, and color are not confused with concepts related to the immune system. \nThe answer: immunological memory", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism.\" This implies that the first line of defense against pathogens is physical barriers. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including physical barriers and the innate and adaptive immune systems. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which applies to the question since it asks for the first line of defense, which is the opposite of the pathogen breaching the barriers. \nThe answer: physical barriers", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule 8 states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\". In this case, \"self\" and \"non-self\" are different concepts, so the adaptive immune system must distinguish between self and non-self molecules.\nThe answer: self and non-self molecules", "{3}\nExplanation: The article states that in immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. \nThe answer: self molecules", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The immune system recognizes non-self molecules as foreign. This is in contrast to self molecules, which are components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. \nThe answer: Non-self molecules", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage defines antigens as \"substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.\" The passage also notes that \"antigens\" is short for \"antibody generators.\" \nThe answer: antigens", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Antigens bind to specific immune receptors in order to elicit a response of the immune system.\nThe answer: immune receptors", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A) and 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts). The question asks for the part of the innate immune system that identifies microbes and triggers immune response. The answer is pattern recognition receptors, which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms. This is because these receptors identify specific patterns, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, or color.", "{3, 9, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms.\"\nThe answer: The innate immune system", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The answer can be found in the passage \"The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors, which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms\". The answer is microorganisms. \nThe answer: microorganisms", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, but the question does not relate to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the opposite of a statement made in the passage (\"non-specific\"), so we can use the antonym of \"specific\" to answer the question. \nThe answer: non-specific", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the exoskeleton of insects is a mechanical barrier that protects them from infection. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts, including insects and their physical characteristics. Rule 8 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the exoskeleton is more protective than not having an exoskeleton, so not having an exoskeleton is less protective than having one. \nThe answer: Exoskeleton", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate options that refer to these concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if mechanical barriers are the first line of defense against infection, then the absence of mechanical barriers would make an organism more vulnerable to infection. Therefore, the answer is the waxy cuticle of many leaves. \nThe answer: waxy cuticle", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: Mechanical barriers such as coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract.\nThe answer: coughing and sneezing", "{3, 4, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that states \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that the waxy cuticle, exoskeleton, shells, membranes, and skin are all examples of mechanical barriers. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract are different concepts. Rule 5 is relevant because it establishes that animals and microorganisms are different concepts. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: mucus", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the flushing action of tears\" expels pathogens from the eyes. This is a clear and direct answer to the question.\nThe answer: tears", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the skin secretes antimicrobial peptides, and since there is no mention of any other type of peptide, it can be inferred that the antimicrobial peptides secreted by the skin are the only type mentioned in the passage. Additionally, since the passage uses the term \"\u03b2-defensins\" to refer to these peptides, it can be concluded that this is their specific name.\nThe answer: \u03b2-defensins", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: lysozyme and phospholipase A2", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Semen contains defensins and zinc, which act as antibacterials to kill pathogens.\nThe answer: defensins and zinc", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the chemical defenses in the stomach, specifically gastric acid and proteases. These compounds protect against ingested pathogens by breaking them down and killing them. \nThe answer: gastric acid and proteases", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: menarche", "3, 8\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Therefore, the answer cannot be any of these concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space. Therefore, the answer is commensal flora. \n\nThe answer: Commensal flora", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, the answer is fungi. \nThe answer: fungi", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that pure cultures of lactobacilli are found in unpasteurized yogurt and can be used as probiotic flora to restore a healthy balance of microbial populations. \nThe answer: lactobacilli", "{rule list} \nExplanation: Commensal flora can change the pH or available iron in their environment in the gastrointestinal tract. \nThe answer: pH or available iron.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The immune system's first response to infection is inflammation, which is characterized by redness, swelling, heat, and pain caused by increased blood flow into tissue. This is in line with rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Inflammation", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The symptoms of inflammation are caused by increased blood flow into tissue, which is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines released by injured or infected cells. According to rule 3, size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the symptoms cannot be described as any of those. According to rule 8, if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the symptoms are caused by increased blood flow, then the absence of increased blood flow would cause the absence of symptoms. \nThe answer: Increased blood flow into tissue caused by eicosanoids and cytokines released by injured or infected cells.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells.\nThe answer: eicosanoids and cytokines", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: \"Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation\" - This answer requires knowledge of the definition of eicosanoids and their specific effects on the body. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as inflammation and fever. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the compounds that result in fever and blood vessel dilation, which are prostaglandins. The answer is: prostaglandins.", "{3, 4, 5, 7}\nExplanation: Inflammation is a response of the immune system to infection, and is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines. Cytokines are responsible for communication between white blood cells. Therefore, we need to consider rules 3, 4, 5, and 7. \nThe answer: interleukins", "{1, 3, 5}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of \"pathogens or particles\" which are being engulfed by the cells. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the specific type of cells that perform phagocytosis. Rule 5 applies because the question asks for the function of the cells. \nThe answer: Phagocytes", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that phagocytes can be called to specific locations by cytokines. This is a specific aspect of the process of phagocytosis, which is the main topic of the passage. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) and rule 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph) are the most relevant. \nThe answer: cytokines", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 9 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the rule applies because if a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in a phagosome. Therefore, when a pathogen has been eaten by a phagocyte it becomes trapped in a phagosome. Rule 16 is also relevant because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first. In this case, the question asks about the vesicle in which the pathogen becomes trapped, which is the last step in the process described in the passage. \nThe answer: Phagosome", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 9 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the phagosome fuses with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. Rule 23 is also relevant because it states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question asks what is formed, which is the object of the passive sentence \"a phagolysosome is formed when a phagosome fuses with a lysosome.\" Therefore, the answer is a phagolysosome.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: acquiring nutrients", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found in the passage, which states that \"Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.\" Therefore, the two types of phagocytes are neutrophils and macrophages.\nThe answer: Neutrophils and macrophages.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the \"most abundant\" kind of phagocyte, which implies a comparison with other types. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that \"abundance\" is a different concept from the function or role of the phagocytes. \nThe answer: Neutrophils", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the percentage of leukocytes that neutrophils represent, which implies that leukocytes are more general and neutrophils are a subset. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a numerical value related to size. \nThe answer: 50% to 60%", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Neutrophils move towards the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, which is the answer to the question. \nThe answer: chemotaxis", "{3, 4, 5, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that macrophages produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1. \nThe answer: interleukin 1", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"white blood cells\" and \"leukocytes\" are synonyms. Rule 3 applies because \"white\" and \"leukocytes\" refer to different concepts. \nThe answer: Leukocytes", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a comparison between different entities (arms of the immune system). Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts (cells and immune system). \nThe answer: leukocytes/white blood cells", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the innate immune system and how innate leukocytes, including various types of cells, identify and eliminate pathogens. The last sentence states that innate cells are important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system. \nThe answer: adaptive immune system", "{3, 5, 6}\nExplanation: The third rule states that different concepts, such as types of leukocytes, should not be confused with each other. The fifth rule states that animals and cells are different concepts. The sixth rule states that a list of entities should be treated in a specific way. Therefore, the answer is: macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we know that the answer will be a specific term. Therefore, the answer is: dendritic cells.", "{3}\nExplanation: Dendritic cells are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites.\nThe answer: neuronal dendrites", "{3, 16, 19}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and not interchangeable. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. \nThe answer: T cells", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The rules state that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, as are profession and nationality, and animals and vehicles. Therefore, the fact that dendritic cells present antigens to T cells is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and the question includes the word \"not\" (\"not connected to the nervous system\"), indicating that the answer is not related to the nervous system. The answer is T cells. \n\nThe answer: T cells", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"missing self\" is a comparative concept, indicating that the cells have low levels of a certain marker compared to normal cells. Rule 3 applies because \"missing self\" refers to a specific concept related to cell markers, not to size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: \"missing self\"", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that natural killer cells are a component of the innate immune system that does not directly attack invading microbes. \nThe answer: Natural killer cells", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We can use rule 3 to determine that \"cell-surface marker\" is a different concept from \"tumor cells\" and \"virus-infected cells\". Then, we can use rule 8 to infer that \"missing self\" means that the cells have low levels of MHC I. \nThe answer: MHC I", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR)", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that the adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates, which are a specific type of organism. Rule 3 applies because the concept of \"type of organism\" is different from the concepts of \"size, shape, age, and color\" and \"profession and nationality.\" Rule 4 applies because the question asks about the type of organism, not their nationality or profession.\nThe answer: early vertebrates", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the process by which the adaptive immune system recognizes specific \"non-self\" antigens. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as \"process\" are important for answering questions. Rule 7 tells us that synonyms such as \"recognize\" and \"identification\" may be used in the question. Rule 17 tells us that negations such as \"non-self\" are important for the answer. \nThe answer: antigen presentation", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.\nThe answer: pathogens or pathogen-infected cells", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"shape, size, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for the \"two major subtypes\" of T cells, implying that there are more than two subtypes. Therefore, we can infer that there is a minor subtype of T cells in addition to the two major subtypes. The answer is killer T cells and helper T cells.", "{4, 5, 6, 8}\nExplanation: T cells have three major subtypes: killer T cells, helper T cells, and regulatory T cells. The latter have a role in modulating immune response. Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules. Therefore, the answer is regulatory T cells. \nThe answer: regulatory T cells", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules. This follows rule 3, which states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the concept of MHC molecules is different from other concepts such as antigens and T cells, and the passage specifies that killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules. \nThe answer: Class I MHC molecules", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The relevant rule is that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A.\" The question asks about which kind of molecules helper and regulatory T cells can recognize, and the answer is that they can only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules. Therefore, since killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules, it can be inferred that Class II MHC molecules are the antonym of Class I MHC molecules.", "{5, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the fact that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are a subtype of T cells means that they cannot be a type of animal or vehicle. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if killer T cells and helper T cells recognize antigens coupled to Class I and Class II MHC molecules respectively, then \u03b3\u03b4 T cells must recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors. \nThe answer: \u03b3\u03b4 T cells do not recognize antigens coupled to Class I or Class II MHC molecules, but instead recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage explains that Killer T cells are a sub-group of T cells that kill cells infected with viruses or other pathogens. This means that the answer is Killer T cells.\nThe answer: Killer T cells", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"shape, size, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because it helps us understand that if CD8 helps in recognizing the MHC-antigen complex, then without CD8, the recognition would be less efficient. Therefore, CD8 is more important for recognition than without it. \nThe answer: CD8", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: T cell receptor (TCR)", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: The passage explains that when an activated T cell contacts a cell with the specific MHC:antigen complex, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water, and toxins to enter. One of these toxins is granulysin, which induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. \nThe answer: granulysin", "{1, 2, 3, 5}\nExplanation: We need to identify what cytotoxins are released by activated killer T cells when they find cells with specific antigens on their MHC Class I receptors. Rule 1 tells us that if A releases more cytotoxins than B, then B releases less cytotoxins than A. Rule 2 tells us that if A releases cytotoxins and B releases very few cytotoxins, then A releases the most cytotoxins and B releases the least cytotoxins. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to this question. Rule 5 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts and are not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: perforin and granulysin", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: The passage explains that helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation. \nThe answer: CD4 co-receptor", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200\u2013300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell. \nThe answer: around 200-300", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule, which means they require fewer receptors to be bound than helper T cells. Therefore, the answer is: a single MHC:antigen molecule.", "{3, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. This is supported by the sentence \"Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells.\" Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including chemicals and cell activity. Rule 6 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and cells. Rule 17 is relevant because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: cytokines", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: CD40 ligand is a molecule expressed on the surface of helper T cells that is upregulated after activation.\nThe answer: CD40 ligand", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can't assume that sharing characteristics means they are the same type of cell. Rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can rephrase the question as \"What types of T cells share characteristics with gamma delta T cells?\" The answer: helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells.", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The passage states that gamma delta T cells possess an alternative T cell receptor (TCR) as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ (\u03b1\u03b2) T cells. This means that they have a different version of the T cell receptor.\nThe answer: T cell receptor", "{3, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how gamma delta T cells have characteristics of both innate and adaptive immunity, straddling the border between the two. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including innate and adaptive immunity. Rule 6 is relevant because it emphasizes that animals and cells are different concepts. Rule 17 is relevant because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Gamma delta T cells", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that \"rearrange TCR genes\" is the action being taken by gamma delta T cells. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, so we know that gamma delta T cells are the ones rearranging the TCR genes. \nThe answer: receptor diversity", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"large numbers of human V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes.\" This means that V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells are more responsive to these molecules than other T cell subsets, and therefore can be considered to \"respond to\" them. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as size, shape, age, and color, which are not relevant to the answer, and the concept of type of T cell, which is relevant. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells are more responsive to common molecules produced by microbes than other T cell subsets, so it can be inferred that other T cell subsets are less responsive to these molecules than V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells. Therefore, the answer is: V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question mentions \"identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen,\" which implies a comparison between the B cell and another entity. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the type of cell, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: B cell", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the process by which the antigen/antibody complex is processed into peptides, which is described in the passage as \"processed by proteolysis into peptides.\" The relevant rules are 3 (clarifying that \"processed\" refers to a different concept than \"antigen/antibody complex\"), 9 (explaining that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B), and 17 (noting that negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: proteolysis", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 9 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks what the matching helper T cell releases, so we can infer that it releases something when it binds with the MHC:antigen complex of the B cell. Rule 17 is also relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is: lymphokines.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be used to answer the question. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the relationship between two things (B cells/T cells and their offspring cells). According to rule 8, if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that \"some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells,\" so we can infer that not all of their offspring become memory cells. Therefore, the answer is: some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The concept of \"immune response\" is different from concepts like size, shape, age, and color, so rule 3 applies. The question asks about the function of long-lived memory cells, which is a positive statement, so rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: adaptive immune response", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so they cannot be confused with the concept of immunological memory. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if there are two forms of immunological memory, they must be opposite. \nThe answer: passive short-term memory and active long-term memory.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if long-lived memory cells can remember previous encounters with something, then they can also remember encounters with the absence or lack of that thing. Therefore, the answer is pathogens. \nThe answer: pathogens", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection.\" The negation in the question (\"no previous exposure\") is important for the answer.\nThe answer: microbes", "{1, 2, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the mother and baby in terms of antibody levels. Rule 2 applies because it clarifies that the baby does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the different types of antibodies mentioned in the passage. Rule 13 applies because it emphasizes the importance of the mother in providing passive immunity to the baby. \nThe answer: IgG", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Antibodies are transferred to the gut of the infant through breast milk or colostrum. \nThe answer: breast milk or colostrum", "{3, 5, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Antibodies are transferred from the mother to the infant via the placenta, providing passive immunity to the newborn. This passive immunity is short-lived, lasting from a few days up to several months. Therefore, the answer is passive immunity.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if A can alter the sensitivity of the immune system more than B, then B can alter it less than A. Rule 3 applies because sensitivity and hormones are different concepts. \nThe answer: immunomodulators", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if female sex hormones are more immunostimulatory than male sex hormones, then male sex hormones are less immunostimulatory than female sex hormones. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking specifically about the type of immune responses affected by female sex hormones. \nThe answer: both adaptive and innate immune responses", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 17, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: These rules ensure that we correctly identify the specific autoimmune disease that affects women. Rule 1 helps us understand that if a disease affects women preferentially, then it affects men less. Rule 3 reminds us that age and gender are different concepts. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is irrelevant to this question. Rule 5 reminds us that animals and diseases are different concepts. Rule 8 tells us that if a disease affects women preferentially, then it affects men in the opposite way. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. Rule 19 and 20 remind us that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession and that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. Rule 21 tells us that \"his\" refer to male names and \"her\" refer to female names.\nThe answer: lupus erythematosus", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"gender is irrelevant to profession\" does not apply here as we are discussing the effect of a hormone on the male immune system. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies as the passage states that male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Therefore, the answer is: immunosuppressive.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the protein NFIL3 is closely intertwined with circadian rhythms. This is relevant because rule 3 states that concepts such as shape, size, age, and color are different, and rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, we can identify NFIL3 as the protein that is closely intertwined with circadian rhythms.\nThe answer: NFIL3", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Disruptions in sleep can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.\nThe answer: heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because sleep deprivation is being compared to being well-rested. Rule 3 applies because sleep deprivation is a different concept from immune response and antibody production.\nThe answer: sleep deprivation", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that \"a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals.\" This means that the decline in hormone levels is one of the factors that contribute to weakened immune response in older individuals.\nThe answer: decline in hormone levels", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule that \"age\" is a different concept from \"color\" applies, as the question is asking about a specific aspect of the skin's function as a person ages. The rule that \"typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer\" applies, as the typo in \"cholecalciferol\" does not affect the answer.\nThe answer: vitamin D", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rules that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" and \"negations are important for the answer\" are relevant because the question asks for the signalling molecules that are regulated by the immune system, which is the opposite of the usual relationship between signalling molecules and the immune system. The rule that \"if A is more X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" is not relevant because there are no comparisons between different signalling molecules in the passage. \nThe answer: thyroid hormone activity", "{2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer involves a comparison between the amount of a chemical produced by older people and younger people, which falls under rule 2. The chemical is produced via UVB radiation, which is a concept related to rule 3. The question involves a negation, which is important for the answer and falls under rule 8.\nThe answer: cholecalciferol", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a comparison between different types of immune cells. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves different concepts. \nThe answer: killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells.", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify what type of molecule is present in fewer numbers on the surface of tumor cells. Rule 3 tells us that we need to differentiate between concepts, so we can't confuse this molecule with any other type of molecule. Rule 9 tells us that if tumor cells have fewer of this molecule, then normal cells have more of it. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the wording of the question. The answer: MHC class I molecules.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens.\nThe answer: viral antigens", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.\" Therefore, the answer is antibodies. \nThe answer: antibodies", "{3}\nExplanation: This rule states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from each other. The passage states that unlike animals, plants lack phagocytic cells, which are a type of immune cell that engulfs and destroys pathogens. Therefore, the answer is phagocytic cells.\nThe answer: phagocytic cells", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the question does not involve any of these concepts. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, and the question uses the synonym \"molecules\" instead of \"Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs\". Therefore, the answer is: PAMPs.", "{rule list: 3, 9}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"When a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant.\" Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the plant. Rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"rapid apoptosis\" is the process that cells undergo to prevent the spread of the disease. Therefore, the answer is: rapid apoptosis.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage explains that plants have a defense response called systemic acquired resistance (SAR) that makes the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. This is a different concept from animals and vehicles, as specified in rule 5. \nThe answer: Systemic acquired resistance (SAR)", "{3, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how plants have immune responses to pathogens, including the use of systemic chemical signals and the localized hypersensitive response. It also mentions that RNA silencing mechanisms are important in the systemic acquired resistance response. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that RNA silencing mechanisms are a mechanism is not relevant to the answer. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the fact that plants lack phagocytic cells is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that RNA silencing mechanisms can block virus replication is the relevant information. \nThe answer: RNA silencing mechanisms", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is also not relevant. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the opposite of a normal immune response. The answer is autoimmune disorders.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: In autoimmune disorders, the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self, attacking part of the body. This means that the immune system doesn't distinguish between the body's own cells (self) and foreign cells (non-self). \nThe answer: self", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Specialized cells that eliminate cells that recognize self-antigens are located in the thymus and bone marrow.\nThe answer: thymus and bone marrow", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: T cells and antibodies react with \"self\" peptides under normal circumstances, which means that they do not produce non-self peptides. Therefore, the answer is self peptides.\nThe answer: self peptides", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The first rule applies because it directly addresses the concept of \"inactive\" or \"diminished\" immune system components. The third rule applies because it clarifies that \"disorders\" and \"immunodeficiencies\" are different concepts from size, shape, age, and color.\nThe answer: immunodeficiencies", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: The immune system response begins to decline at around 50 years of age, affecting the elderly. It is also diminished in the young. \nThe answer: the young and the elderly", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: As per rule 2, if immune responses begin to decline at around 50 years of age, then it can be inferred that younger individuals have better immune responses. Therefore, rule 8 applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Thus, the answer is: around 50 years of age.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are not relevant to the answer. If A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. The answer: obesity, alcoholism, and drug use.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"causes\" and \"effects\" are different concepts (rule 3) helps us identify that the passage is discussing the causes of immunodeficiency. Rule 8 tells us that if one factor is more common than another, then the less common factor is the more common antonym. Finally, rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: malnutrition", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that active immunity can be generated artificially through vaccination, which introduces an antigen from a pathogen to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that pathogen without causing disease. The use of the word \"artificially\" implies that this process is not natural, which is a form of negation. Therefore, rules 3 and 17 are relevant.\nThe answer: vaccination", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the alternative name for vaccination. Rule 3 states that synonyms are important for the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 17 states that negations in the question are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is \"immunization\". \n\nThe answer: immunization", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for what is introduced in the process of vaccination to develop specific immunity. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is relevant because the question is asking for what is introduced to develop specific immunity. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is not relevant to the question. \nThe answer: an antigen from a pathogen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer mentions \"exploiting the natural specificity of the immune system\" which refers to the fact that the immune system can recognize and target specific pathogens. This is a feature of the immune system that is being exploited by vaccination. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including the concepts of \"specificity\" and \"inducibility\" of the immune system. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that the answer is discussing the opposite of a comparison (i.e. the feature being exploited, rather than a feature being more or less than another). \nThe answer: the natural specificity of the immune system", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: enzymes", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being an animal or a vehicle. The rule that \"shape\" is a different concept from \"system of infection\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being a shape. Therefore, the answer must be the type III secretion system.\nThe answer: type III secretion system", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: The passage describes how bacteria use a type III secretion system to insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses. \nThe answer: shut down host defenses.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the success of a pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses, which implies that if a pathogen is more successful at eluding immune responses than another pathogen, the latter is less successful at doing so. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the ability of pathogens, which is a different concept from their size, shape, age, or color.\nThe answer: elude host immune responses", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the person who formulated the clonal selection theory of immunity. Rules 1 and 4 are relevant because they establish that profession and nationality are different concepts and that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 13 is also relevant because it establishes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Frank Burnet", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: According to the clonal selection theory of immunity formulated by Frank Burnet, \"nonself\" entities trigger a destructive immune response. Therefore, the answer to the question is any two examples of nonself entities, such as pathogens and allografts.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that the question is asking for a concept, not a physical object. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if the article mentions a modification to a theory, that modification should be considered as part of the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a specific term, and the negation \"not\" is important to identify that term. \nThe answer: the \"two-signal\" activation", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the scientist who influenced Frank Burnet when he was formulating his theory of immunity. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a name in the passage. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that Niels Jerne is the first name mentioned in the passage and therefore the answer.\nThe answer: Niels Jerne", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the strength of different types of anti-inflammatory drugs. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concept of strength and the concept of class. \nThe answer: Glucocorticoids", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: In the passage, it is mentioned that lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine. This means that anti-inflammatory drugs are sometimes used with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs.\nThe answer: cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine. This means that methotrexate and azathioprine are examples of cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs.\nThe answer: methotrexate and azathioprine", "{3, 4, 5, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts. Animals and vehicles are different concepts. The question contains a synonym for \"inhibit\" which is \"prevent\". Negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Cyclosporin.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for cells that peak during wake periods, implying that there are other cells that peak during other periods. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific type of cell, not their size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes)", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rules eliminate any irrelevant information and focus on identifying the two anti-inflammatory molecules that peak during awake hours.\nThe answer: cortisol and catecholamines", "{3, 5, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that inflammation occurs during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin, which actively counteracts free radical production during this time. This is supported by the second theory mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: Melatonin", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that inflammation causes oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep can counteract free radical production during this time. Therefore, melatonin can actively counteract the production of free radicals. \nThe answer: Free radicals", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: A T-cell extends a vitamin D receptor when it encounters a foreign pathogen, which allows it to bind to the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol. This receptor is essentially a signaling device that enables the T-cell to perform its intended function. \nThe answer: a vitamin D receptor", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer must be the opposite of \"pre-hormone.\" \nThe answer: calcitriol", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D, as they extend a vitamin D receptor and express the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D into the steroid hormone version. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Therefore, T-cells and vitamin D have a mutually beneficial relationship. \nThe answer: symbiotic", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The concept of genes is different from size, shape, age, and color, and also from animals and vehicles. \nThe answer: CYP27B1", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Names are equally important for the answer, so rule 13 applies. \nThe answer: dendritic cells, keratinocytes, and macrophages.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison between two things (proteins and organisms). Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that size, shape, age, and color are not relevant concepts. \nThe answer: Pattern recognition receptors", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity.\nThe answer: defensins", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts, and recognizing that \"cell type\" refers to a specific aspect of an organism's biology. \nThe answer: phagocytic cells", "{rule list: 3, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses various components of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants, including ribonucleases and the RNA interference pathway. These components are conserved across all eukaryotes and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses.\nThe answer: The RNA interference pathway", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates.\" \nThe answer: immunoglobulins and T cell receptors", "{3, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates any mention of vehicles as a possible answer. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any mention of those characteristics as possible answers. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" means that we need to look for specific names of primitive jawless vertebrates. \nThe answer: lamprey and hagfish", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that primitive jawless vertebrates possess an array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). This directly answers the question.\nThe answer: Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs)", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates.\" Therefore, the evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in the ancestor of jawed vertebrates. The question specifically asks about \"what part of the immune system,\" which refers to the adaptive immune system. \nThe answer: adaptive immune system", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes, which are a type of cell that is a part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. This is because invertebrates do not have a true adaptive immune system like vertebrates do.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate options that refer to these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the defense mechanism of bacteria is not offensive. Therefore, the answer is the restriction modification system. \nThe answer: restriction modification system", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that bacteria use the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Therefore, the answer is bacteriophages. \nThe answer: bacteriophages", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Prokaryotes possess acquired immunity through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past.\nThe answer: CRISPR sequences", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The two main theories of immunity at the end of the 19th century were the \"cellular\" theory and the \"humoral\" theory. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"cellular\" and \"humoral\" are different and should not be compared as if they were on the same scale. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is \"cellular\" and \"humoral\". \n\nThe answer: cellular and humoral", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the \"main proponent\" of the cellular theory, implying that there were other proponents as well. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific concept, which is the \"cellular theory of immunity.\" Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific person, and in this passage, only one person is mentioned as a proponent of the cellular theory. \nThe answer: Elie Metchnikoff", "Rules: 3, 8\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific type of cells is not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Metchnikoff's theory is cellular, then the humoral theory held by Koch and von Behring is not cellular. Therefore, the answer is: phagocytes.", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses two theories of immunity, the cellular theory and the humoral theory. The humoral theory was held by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring. \nThe answer: Robert Koch and Emil von Behring", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and color are different concepts is irrelevant. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is also irrelevant. The rule that negations are important for the answer is relevant because the question asks for the active immune agents according to the humoral theory, which is a negation of the cellular theory. Therefore, the answer is \"soluble components (molecules) found in the organism\u2019s 'humors' rather than its cells.\"", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if tumors are able to evade the immune response, they can become cancers. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer is \"cancers\". \nThe answer: Cancers.", "Rules: 1, 3\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that tumor cells have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules, which means that the immune system is less able to detect them. Rule 3 applies because size, shape, age, and color are different concepts than receptors. \nThe answer: MHC class I molecules", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that some tumor cells secrete the cytokine TGF-\u03b2, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes, thus inhibiting the immune response. Therefore, the answer is TGF-\u03b2.\nThe answer: TGF-\u03b2", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: \"suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes\"\nThe answer: macrophages and lymphocytes", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A is damaging B, then B is being damaged by A. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the concept being referred to is \"immune response\" and not \"tissues.\"\nThe answer: Hypersensitivity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify the number of classes of immune hypersensitivity, which is a straightforward factual question. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and not relevant to this question. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use the fact that there are four classes of immune hypersensitivity, and since we are looking for the number of classes, we can say that there are not more or less than four classes. Therefore, the answer is: 4.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the type of hypersensitivity associated with allergies, which is Type I hypersensitivity. Rule 3 applies because the other types of hypersensitivity are mentioned in the passage, but only Type I is associated with allergies. \nThe answer: Type I", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, so the answer is IgE.", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: Antibody-dependent hypersensitivity is also called Type II hypersensitivity, which occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This type of hypersensitivity is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. \nThe answer: Type II", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes how pathogens evade the immune system by hiding inside the cells of their host, which is also known as intracellular pathogenesis. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is important to focus on the concept of intracellular pathogenesis rather than any other details in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so it is important to note that the question is asking for the process by which pathogens evade the immune system, not how they are attacked by it. \nThe answer: intracellular pathogenesis", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Salmonella", "{rule list: 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a specific eukaryotic parasite responsible for malaria. Rule 3 states that concepts such as shape and color are not relevant to the answer, while rule 7 allows for synonyms to be used in the question. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Plasmodium falciparum", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"shape\" is a different concept from \"age\" and \"color\" and the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B apply here. The passage states that Mycobacterium tuberculosis lives inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Therefore, the answer is Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that Staphylococcus aureus produces \"protein A\" to bind to antibodies and render them ineffective. The relevant rules are 3 (to distinguish between different concepts), 7 (to identify synonyms), and 17 (to recognize the importance of negations). \nThe answer: protein A", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the name of a process that involves changing non-essential epitopes, which is a comparison of the level of essentiality between different epitopes. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific term for a concept, which is the process of changing non-essential epitopes. \nThe answer: antigenic variation", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage mentions that HIV mutates rapidly and changes the proteins on its viral envelope, which is an example of antigenic variation. Rule 3 applies to clarify that size, shape, age, and color are not relevant concepts to the answer. \nThe answer: HIV", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage mentions HIV as an example of a pathogen that uses antigenic variation to evade the immune system. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for an example of a parasite, which is a different concept than a virus. \nThe answer: Trypanosoma brucei", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that one strategy for evading the immune system is to mask antigens with host molecules. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in the question or passage. \nThe answer: antigens", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The immune system identifies tumors through a process called immune surveillance, which is the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate abnormal cells, including tumor cells. This process is possible because tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells, making them appear foreign to the immune system. \nThe answer: immune surveillance", "{3, 7, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer...\" \nThe answer: human papillomavirus", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"enzymes\" and \"proteins\" are different concepts (rule 3) and the rule that \"animals\" and \"cells\" are different concepts (rule 5) are relevant. \nThe answer: tyrosinase", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The article explains that when the enzyme tyrosinase is expressed at high levels, it can transform certain skin cells into tumors called melanomas. This means that melanomas are cancerous tumors of the skin.\nThe answer: melanomas", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the skin cells that can be transformed into tumors. The answer is \"melanocytes,\" which is mentioned in the passage. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that \"skin cells\" and \"melanocytes\" are different concepts. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms, such as \"transformed\" for \"turned into tumors.\" Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Melanocytes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from immunogenicity, so rule 3 applies. The question asks about drugs that can elicit an immune response, which is a comparison of immunogenicity, so rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: Larger drugs (>500 Da)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions, then hydrophobic amino acids are underrepresented in epitope regions. \nThe answer: hydrophilic amino acids", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the study of large sets of proteins involved in the immune response, which is referred to as immunoproteomics. This answer is found in the last sentence of the passage.\nThe answer: Immunoproteomics", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a \"publicly accessible database\" that catalogs epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: B cells", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a field related to studying immunogenicity through bioinformatics. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the size, shape, or color of the drugs. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"field\" or \"study\" in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative phrasing in the passage. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to identify the correct subject and verb in the sentence. The answer: immunoinformatics.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule of law article states that a drop in the blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induces increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. Rule 2 applies because the article states that a drop in cortisol and epinephrine levels results in an increase in the levels of these hormones. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the hormones that increase when cortisol and epinephrine levels drop. \nThe answer: leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: APCs (antigen-presenting cells)", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the question asks for the antonym of a certain concept, we can use this rule to find the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negations in the question. \nThe answer: There is no information in the article about a shift in cytokine balance to a specific cytokine.", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes how hormones released during early slow-wave-sleep induce a pro-inflammatory state and stimulate immune functions such as immune cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. This leads to the peak of undifferentiated or less differentiated T cells during a slowly evolving adaptive immune response, which supports the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses. Therefore, the answer is Th1 immune responses.\nThe answer: Th1 immune responses.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that complement proteins bind to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes in order to elicit an immune response. \nThe answer: carbohydrates", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: The article explains that the deposition of complement can kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane. This means that the complement proteins cause damage to the membrane of the invader cells, leading to their destruction. This is a direct effect of the complement deposition. Therefore, rules 3 (different concepts), 9 (antonyms), and 23 (active vs passive) are relevant. \nThe answer: by disrupting their plasma membrane.", "{1, 3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the question asks about the process that contributes to the speed of the immune system's killing response, implying that there are other factors involved. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the passage. The answer is: signal amplification.", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the type of cascade that occurs when complement proteins bind to microbes and activate their protease activity. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is also not relevant. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because the question is asking about the type of cascade that results from complement binding to microbes, not the type that does not result. The answer is a catalytic cascade. \n\nThe answer: catalytic cascade", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a term that describes when people rebel against laws they deem unfair. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. This means that if people are rebelling against laws, they are doing so because they believe the laws are unfair. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and therefore not applicable to this question. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that profession and nationality are different concepts and therefore not applicable to this question. Rule 5 is relevant because it establishes that animals and vehicles are different concepts and therefore not applicable to this question. Rule 7 is relevant because it establishes that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, and the answer to this question is a synonym for \"rebel against laws they think are unfair.\" Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer, and the question is asking for a term that describes when people rebel against laws they think are unfair. \n", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: fight against apartheid", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Singing Revolution", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country where the Orange revolution occurred, which is a specific event in a specific year. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"occurred\" which implies a past event, and the article mentions the Orange Revolution as a past event. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"what\" which implies a positive answer, and the article mentions the Orange Revolution as an example of civil disobedience in various countries. \nThe answer: Ukraine", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Georgia", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Egyptians used civil disobedience in the 1919 Revolution against British occupation. \nThe answer: Egyptians.", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that civil disobedience was used by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution. \nThe answer: British occupation", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Civil disobedience is chosen by people to protest against what they deem to be unfair laws.", "{rule list: 1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Civil disobedience is a way people rebel against what they deem to be unfair laws. Rule 1 applies because civil disobedience is a form of rebellion, and rule 7 applies because \"protest\" is a synonym for \"rebel.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what civil disobedience protests against, which implies a negation. \nThe answer: unfair laws", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts eliminates any confusion between civil disobedience and civil rights movement. The rule that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph allows for the use of \"civil rights movement\" instead of \"American Civil Rights Movement.\" The rule that negations are important for the answer eliminates any confusion between civil disobedience being used in the movement and the movement being known for disobedience.\nThe answer: Civil rights movement", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the play in which Sophocles depicted civil disobedience. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name of the play. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the name of the play will come before any other information about it. \nThe answer: Antigone", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Oedipus is Antigone's father, as he is mentioned first in the sentence as the former King of Thebes. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that Antigone is the subject of the sentence and is defying Creon, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother a proper burial.\nThe answer: Oedipus", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, Creon is mentioned after Antigone's father, Oedipus, so he is the current King of Thebes.\nThe answer: Creon", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Antigone", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Creon is trying to stop Antigone from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial, which goes against human law.\nThe answer: giving her brother Polynices a proper burial", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a play that depicts civil disobedience. The passage mentions Sophocles' play Antigone, in which the protagonist defies the king's orders and follows her conscience instead. This is an example of civil disobedience. The negation in the question (\"not early\") is important to note, as it indicates that the answer should refer to an old or ancient play. \nThe answer: Antigone", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Antigone is a play by Sophocles, and Sophocles is a name mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: Sophocles", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes the play Antigone, in which the character Antigone defies the current King of Thebes, Creon, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial. The use of the word \"defies\" implies disobedience, and the passage specifically mentions \"civil disobedience\" in the first sentence. The rule about negations is also relevant, as the question asks for the target of the disobedience, not the person committing it. \nThe answer: Creon", "{rule list: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Antigone defies the current King of Thebes, Creon, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial. Antigone believes that she must obey her conscience rather than human law. The passage does not mention the term \"protest,\" but the concept of civil disobedience is described. The relevant rules are 2 (Antigone's obedience to her conscience makes her the most courageous), 3 (the passage distinguishes between the concepts of law and conscience), 4 (the passage distinguishes between the concepts of profession and nationality), 5 (the passage distinguishes between the concepts of animals and humans), 8 (the passage implies that Antigone's disobedience makes her the most courageous and Creon the least courageous), 12 (the passage contains irrelevant information about Antigone's fear of her conscience), and 17 (the passage describes Antigone's defiance of human law). \nThe answer: Antigone defies Creon to give her brother Pol", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The play Antigone depicts civil disobedience when Antigone defies the current King of Thebes, Creon, by giving her brother Polynices a proper burial, despite it being against the law. Antigone justifies her actions by saying that she must obey her conscience rather than human law. \nThe answer: Antigone defies Creon's law to give her brother Polynices a proper burial.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the poet who wrote The Mask of Anarchy after the Peterloo massacre. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question contains a negation (\"after\"), which means we need to look for a poet who wrote The Mask of Anarchy after the Peterloo massacre. The answer is Percy Shelley. \nThe answer: Percy Shelley", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the type of protest that Shelley's poem is considered the first of. Rule 3 states that color and type of protest are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers that mention color. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"type of protest\" in the passage. The passage mentions \"nonviolent protest,\" so we can infer that the answer should be a type of nonviolent protest. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"unjust\" in the passage, which implies that the type of protest is against unjust authority. \nThe answer: nonviolent protest", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The question asks for the name of Gandhi's doctrine, which was inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. The answer is Satyagraha.", "{4, 7, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The rules indicate that profession and nationality are different concepts (4), questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph (7), names are equally important for the answer (13), and \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names (20). The answer: Gandhi often referenced Shelley's poem in his efforts to promote nonviolence in protest and political action.", "{rule list: 13, 17, 20}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Henry David Thoreau took up a version of Percy Shelley's political poem in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later Gandhi was inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. Therefore, the answer is not about a famous author using similarity and likeness of Percy Shelley in his writing, but rather about two authors who were influenced by Shelley's work in their own writing.\nThe answer: Henry David Thoreau and Gandhi", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the author of the poem The Mask of Anarchy. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the name of the author. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we need to identify the first name of the author. \nThe answer: Percy", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the poem was written \"following the Peterloo massacre of 1819,\" indicating that it was written to protest against the unjust authority that led to the massacre. Negation is important because the question asks for what the poem was written to protest against, not what it was written in support of. \nThe answer: The unjust forms of authority of the time, specifically in response to the Peterloo massacre of 1819.", "{1, 2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that The Mask of Anarchy is \"perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent protest.\" Rule 1 applies because it compares the level of modernity between different statements of the principle. Rule 2 applies because it compares the degree of adherence to the principle between different statements. Rule 7 applies because it clarifies that \"nonviolent protest\" is a concept that can be referred to by different names or synonyms. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the principle shown, which is a negation of the principle of authority that the poem criticizes. \nThe answer: nonviolent protest", "{rule list: 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Ghandi was inspired by Percy Shelley's principle of nonviolent protest, which he expressed in the poem \"The Mask of Anarchy\". This principle was later taken up by Henry David Thoreau in his essay \"Civil Disobedience\" and by Ghandi in his doctrine of Satyagraha, which was based on nonviolent protest and political action. \nThe answer: Satyagraha", "{4, 17, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the person is Indian is not relevant to the answer. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"nonviolent\" in the passage. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can infer that the person in question is male. \nThe answer: Gandhi", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the activities that Vice President Agnew describes as civil disobedience. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms, so \"describes\" can be replaced with \"refers to\". Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for the opposite of civil disobedience. The passage states that Agnew used civil disobedience as a code-word for \"muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins.\" Therefore, the answer is: muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Marshall Cohen", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"suffered from ambiguity\" implies that civil disobedience has become less clear or more confusing over time. Rule 7 applies because \"debased\" is a synonym for \"less clear\" or \"less valuable.\" Rule 17 applies because \"argued\" implies that there is a negation or disagreement about the current state of civil disobedience. \nThe answer: ambiguity", "{rule list: 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the term \"civil disobedience\" has become ambiguous and debased, and has been used to describe a wide range of activities, including criminal behavior. Therefore, the answer to the question is that civil disobedience has been associated with criminal behavior. \nThe answer: Civil disobedience has been associated with criminal behavior.", "2, 7, 17, 18\nExplanation: Rule 2 applies because the article states that the term \"civil disobedience\" has become ambiguous and debased in modern times. Rule 7 applies because \"in modern times\" is a synonym for \"today.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a negation (\"what is said about civil disobedience\"), which is important for the answer. Rule 18 applies because the question includes a negation (\"in modern times\"). \nThe answer: The term \"civil disobedience\" has become ambiguous and debased in modern times.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Marshall Cohen", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses how the term \"civil disobedience\" has become ambiguous and debased in modern times, being used to describe a wide range of activities, including criminal behavior. The use of the term has evolved to include actions that are not necessarily nonviolent or peaceful. \nThe answer: The term \"civil disobedience\" has become ambiguous and debased, and is now used to describe a wide range of activities, including criminal behavior.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Vice President Agnew", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Ambiguity and debasement of the term \"civil disobedience\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: LeGrande", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: extremely difficult, if not impossible", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the difficulty in defining civil disobedience and encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience. Rules 3 and 4 state that different concepts, such as size and profession, should not be confused, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that students studying civil disobedience will often find themselves surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties. This means that the definition of civil disobedience is difficult to formulate and can be interpreted differently by different people. Therefore, specific terminology may have no more or less meaning than the individual orator intends it to have. This is an example of rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph.\nThe answer: semantical problems", "{rule list: 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"specific terminology has no more (or no less) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have.\" This implies that an author's words only offer what they intended for them to imply. Additionally, the use of the word \"only\" in the question indicates a negation, which is important to consider.\nThe answer: No, an author's words offer more than what they intended for them to imply.", "{rule list: 1, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where LeGrande is mentioned as the one who wrote that \"the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult, if not impossible.\" The passage also mentions his encouragement to distinguish between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience. Therefore, rules 1, 7, 12, and 13 are relevant. \nThe answer: LeGrande", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions that there is a \"voluminous literature\" on civil disobedience, but also notes that the \"student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties.\" This suggests that while there is a lot of literature on the subject, it may be difficult to navigate and come to a single, all-encompassing definition.\nThe answer: a voluminous amount", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: semantical problems and grammatical niceties", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage distinguishes between nonviolent civil disobedience and violent civil disobedience, implying that civil disobedience without aggression refers to nonviolent civil disobedience.\nThe answer: nonviolent civil disobedience", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage distinguishes between nonviolent civil disobedience and violent civil disobedience, and the question asks for the type of civil disobedience that is accompanied by aggression, which is another way of asking for the type of civil disobedience that is violent. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) and rule 17 (negations are important) are relevant.\nThe answer: violent civil disobedience", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a term that describes the situation where the head of government refuses to enforce a decision of the highest court. Rule 3 and 4 indicate that concepts such as profession and nationality, and size, shape, age, and color are different and should not be confused. Rule 17 indicates that negations are important for the answer. The answer is: constitutional impasse.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. These rules help to eliminate any confusion about the type of person being referred to in the question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant in this case because the question is asking for a type of person that is not included in the definition of constitutional impasse. \nThe answer: public official", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: pertaining to their relation to the state and its laws", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Civil disobedience pertains to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, while a constitutional impasse refers to a conflict between two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government. Therefore, a person would be considered to be exercising a constitutional impasse in a situation where two public agencies are in conflict. \nThe answer: When there is a conflict between two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Constitutional impasse is distinct from civil disobedience, which pertains to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws. \nThe answer: civil disobedience", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because civil disobedience is defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, which implies that the state has more power than the citizen. Rule 3 applies because civil disobedience is distinguished from a constitutional impasse, which is a different concept. \nThe answer: a citizen's relation to the state and its laws", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a head of government refusing to enforce a decision of the country's highest court in their capacity as a public official", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The article explains that civil disobedience pertains to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, and that it is not applicable to public officials acting in their official capacity. Negation is important for this question because it asks for the type of person who cannot be attributed civil disobedience. \nThe answer: public officials", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article does not provide any information about the population group that mainly performs civil disobedience. However, rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not appropriate to assume that civil disobedience is mainly performed by a specific population group based on their nationality. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and the question is asking for the opposite of what is stated in the article. Therefore, the answer is not specified in the article. \nThe answer: Not specified in the article.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Civil disobedience pertains to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, so non-citizens cannot be part of civil disobedience. \nThe answer: Non-citizens", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Thoreau", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: imprisonment", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Thoreau argues that while the majority may rule, their views collectively are not necessarily right. (rule 2 - \"usually majority rules\", rule 8 - \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\", rule 17 - \"negations are important for the answer\") \nThe answer: not necessarily right", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Resign.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Thoreau argues that only individuals can act unjustly, and therefore, it is an individual who could corrupt a government system. He advises confronting such individuals with the fact that they are making a choice. \nThe answer: an individual", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"final judge of right and wrong\" implies a comparison between individuals and the government. Rule 3 applies because \"judge of right and wrong\" refers to a concept, not a physical attribute. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: The individual.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if someone is acting unjustly, they are more responsible for their actions than anyone else who may be involved. Rule 2 applies because Thoreau's philosophy emphasizes the importance of individual conscience and responsibility. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for who is to blame, implying a negative connotation, and Thoreau's philosophy places blame on individuals who act unjustly. \nThe answer: Individuals who act unjustly.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for someone who was disobedient, which is the opposite of obedience. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for a person's name. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the word \"disobedience.\" \nThe answer: Thoreau", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Resign.\"", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that Thoreau claimed that the majority is not necessarily right. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can infer that Thoreau did not believe that the majority was always right. \nThe answer: The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two entities (governmental and non-governmental agencies) and their level of justification for civil disobedience. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, and in this case, governmental entities are a type of nationality. \nThe answer: governmental entities", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the institutions that Brownlee argues civil disobedience can be justified toward. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different. Therefore, the answer is non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities, as well as international organizations and foreign governments. \nThe answer: non-governmental agencies, international organizations, and foreign governments.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about civil disobedience toward a specific branch of government, so rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) is not relevant. However, rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) is relevant because the question asks for the opposite of what is stated in the passage. The passage states that civil disobedience can be justified against non-governmental agencies, but the question asks about civil disobedience toward the government. Therefore, the answer is that Brownlee does not justify civil disobedience toward the government, but rather toward non-governmental entities. \n\nThe answer: non-governmental entities", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects \"a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken\". The use of the word \"also\" in the question implies that the answer is related to civil disobedience, so we can infer that Brownlee also applies this principle to other entities besides governmental ones. \nThe answer: non-governmental agencies, international organizations, and foreign governments.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (4) is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that negations are important for the answer (17) is relevant because the question asks for the author who claims that public companies can be part of civil disobedience, implying that there may be authors who do not make this claim. The answer is therefore not a specific author, but rather the question implies that there is at least one author who makes this claim. No specific name is given in the article. \nThe answer: Not specified in the article.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Civil disobedience can be justified against non-governmental agencies if it reflects a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken. \nThe answer: if it reflects \"a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken\"", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The first rule applies because the question asks about a claim that some theories make, which implies a comparison between different theories. The third rule applies because the question asks about civil disobedience in general, and theories that distinguish between different types of entities are relevant. The eighth rule applies because the question asks about a claim made by some theories, which implies that there may be other theories that make different claims.\nThe answer: Some theories claim that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities.", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions \"private universities\" as a non-governmental agency that can be the target of civil disobedience. \nThe answer: private universities", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the rule can be applied to say that if law breaking is not done publicly, then it is less likely to be considered civil disobedience. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we must consider the negation in the question. Therefore, the answer is: not considered civil disobedience.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for an alternative to public civil disobedience. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves the concept of disobedience that is not public. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for an antonym of \"public civil disobedience.\" \nThe answer: covert lawbreaking", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: The rules selected help to identify the relevant information in the passage and eliminate irrelevant information. The passage discusses the concept of covert lawbreaking and gives an example of German citizens hiding Jews during the Nazi regime. The answer is that citizens were hiding Jews in their houses. \nThe answer: hiding a Jew in their house.", "{rule list: 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Book of Exodus and specifically references a story in which two women, Shiphrah and Puah, disobeyed a direct order from Pharaoh. This story is found in Exodus 1:15-19, making it the oldest known example of civil disobedience according to Stephen Eilmann. The relevant rules are 13 (names are equally important for the answer) because the question asks for a specific person or event, 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) because the question asks for a specific part of the Bible, and 17 (negations are important for the answer) because the question asks for the oldest known example, implying that there may be other examples of civil disobedience in the Bible. \n\nThe answer: Exodus 1:15-19", "{3, 16, 20}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that different concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are not interchangeable. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. In the given question, the two women defying the pharaoh are named Shiphrah and Puah. \nThe answer: Shiphrah and Puah.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if lawbreaking is not done publicly, it can be considered covert, which is the opposite of public. Rule 2 applies because covert lawbreaking can be considered least public, while public civil disobedience is most public. Rule 3 applies because the concept of public vs. covert is different from the concept of morality vs. immorality. Rule 4 applies because the concept of civil disobedience is different from the concept of breaking the law for personal gain. Rule 7 applies because the question asks for a synonym of \"publicly announced.\" Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a synonym of \"acknowledged.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a condition that must be met. \nThe answer: It must be publicly announced.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the idea that lawbreaking must be publicly announced to constitute civil disobedience, but also raises the question of why disobedience should take that form. Rule 1 and 2 apply to the comparison between public civil disobedience and covert lawbreaking. Rule 3 applies to the distinction between lawbreaking and civil disobedience. Rule 4 applies to the distinction between morality and legality. Rule 8 applies to the idea that disobedience requires a conflict with rules. Rule 17 applies to the use of negation in the question. \nThe answer: a conflict with rules", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if public civil disobedience is recognized as effective, then covert lawbreaking is less effective. Rule 3 applies because the article discusses the effectiveness of different methods of disobedience, not their size, shape, age, or color. Rule 7 applies because the question asks for a synonym of civil disobedience. \nThe answer: covert lawbreaking", "{1, 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the idea that covert lawbreaking may be a form of civil disobedience if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality. The example given is of a lawyer assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury to help a client secure their natural rights. This assumes that common morality does not prohibit deceit in such situations. Therefore, the answer is an example of covert lawbreaking that is justified by moral considerations. \nThe answer: German citizens hiding a Jew during the Holocaust and lying to the secret police about it.", "{13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Book of Exodus and how Shiphrah and Puah disobeyed a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it, which can be considered an act of civil disobedience. The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Book of Exodus", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses whether civil disobedience must be non-violent, and Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that it requires \"carefully chosen and legitimate means,\" but does not have to be non-violent. Therefore, the answer is that civil disobedience does not only include non-violent behavior.\nThe answer: non-violent", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific dictionary that includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience. Rule 3 states that color and language are different concepts, so it is irrelevant that the dictionary is called \"Black's Law Dictionary.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to focus on the fact that the dictionary includes non-violence in its definition. \nThe answer: Black's Law Dictionary", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant because the passage compares civil disobedience and civil rebellion, stating that civil rebellion is much more destructive. \nThe answer: Civil rebellion", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they establish the relationship between non-violence and violence. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks about the presence or absence of a negation. \nThe answer: tolerance", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about whether a certain practice is included or excluded, which can be seen as a comparison. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about a major practice, which is a concept. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about a practice, which is different from nationality or profession. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about whether a certain practice is included or excluded, which can be seen as a comparison. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about debates, which may involve negations. \nThe answer: violence", "2, 17\nExplanation: Rule 2 states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, the article states that Christian Bay's encyclopedia article holds that civil disobedience requires \"carefully chosen and legitimate means,\" but holds that they do not have to be non-violent. This implies that non-violent civil disobedience is the most commonly accepted type. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and since the question asks for the type of civil disobedience that is commonly accepted, the answer is non-violent civil disobedience. \n\nThe answer: Non-violent civil disobedience.", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: When violence is used, civil disobedience is sometimes called civil rebellion.\nThe answer: civil rebellion", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that different concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are not interchangeable. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, civil disobedience and civil rebellion are two different concepts, and the article argues that civil rebellion is much more destructive than civil disobedience. Therefore, one result of civil rebellion is destruction. \nThe answer: destruction", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and violence is a different concept from civil disobedience. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if civil disobedience is non-violent, then violent civil disobedience is less preferred. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the negation of violence is the reason why non-violent civil disobedience is preferred. \nThe answer: To help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the term used to describe an active attempt to overthrow a government or belief system. Rule 1 applies because it provides a way to rephrase the question as \"What is the opposite of non-revolutionary civil disobedience?\" Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the answer should not be related to size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: Revolutionary civil disobedience", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Hungarians under Ferenc De\u00e1k", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Ferenc De\u00e1k", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: not given (there is no specific example mentioned in the article)", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and negations are important for the answer. The passage mentions that civil disobedience can be used to change cultural traditions, social customs, and religious beliefs, which are all different topics. Therefore, the answer is: cultural traditions, social customs, and religious beliefs.", "{1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares two concepts (revolutionary and non-revolutionary civil disobedience). Rule 2 applies because it compares the degree of a concept (simple disobedience vs. active attempt to overthrow). Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts (laws and individual conscience). Rule 7 applies because the question asks for a synonym of \"simple.\" Rule 11 applies because contractions are irrelevant. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a positive statement. \nThe answer: Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged \"wrong\" by an individual conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if a person judges a law to be \"wrong,\" then they may choose civil disobedience as a way to oppose it. Rule 3 applies because the reason for choosing civil disobedience is based on a judgment of the morality or ethics of the law, rather than its size, shape, age, or color. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the reason why someone would choose civil disobedience, which implies that there may be other reasons why they would not choose it. \nThe answer: Because they judge the laws to be \"wrong.\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to disobey laws judged \"wrong\" by an individual conscience, to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from type of civil disobedience, so rule 3 applies. The question asks for the type of civil disobedience that is larger scale, which implies a comparison of scale between different types. Therefore, rule 8 also applies. \nThe answer: Revolutionary civil disobedience", "{1, 2, 7, 13, 20}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they establish that \"revolutionary civil disobedience\" is more extreme than \"non-revolutionary civil disobedience.\" Rule 7 is relevant because it establishes that synonyms for \"civil disobedience\" may be used in the question. Rule 13 is relevant because it establishes that names are important for the answer. Rule 20 is relevant because it establishes that the gender of the person is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Gandhi's actions", "{1, 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire, which implies that there were earlier examples of civil disobedience as a whole. Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 applies because it clarifies that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because it clarifies that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: During the Roman Empire.", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"pagan images\" can be replaced by \"pagan items\". The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the answer is \"gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images\". \nThe answer: Gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Thoreau's arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened.\nThe answer: His arrest was not covered in any newspapers.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: higher political office", "{16, 22, 24}\nExplanation: Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War, and at the time of his arrest, he was not yet a well-known author. Therefore, we can infer that his essay was not published until some time after his arrest. Using rule 22, we can determine that \"after the end of the Mexican War\" refers to a later time than Thoreau's arrest. Therefore, the answer is: after the end of the Mexican War.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire, but the citation needed tag indicates that this information may not be entirely reliable. Therefore, we must consider the negation in the question and answer with \"we don't know\" or \"it is not recorded\".\nThe answer: It is not recorded.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that unarmed Jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem during the Roman Empire. This implies that the goal of the disobedience was to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple. \nThe answer: To prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem.", "{2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that in modern times, some activists commit civil disobedience as a group and collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met. This is a form of jail solidarity. \nThe answer: Activists refusing to sign bail until certain demands are met.", "{2, 12}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because the question asks for a specific type of civil disobedience, and the answer mentions \"a form of jail solidarity.\" Rule 12 applies because the passage mentions that this type of civil disobedience involves activists collectively refusing to sign bail until certain demands are met. \nThe answer: jail solidarity", "{rule list} 1, 16, 22\nExplanation: Thoreau's disobedience was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened, and his essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.\nThe answer: It took several years for Thoreau's disobedience to be known.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two things (illegal acts) and compares them (some are more harmful than others). Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts (types of illegal acts). \nThe answer: behaviors that are illegal", "{rule list} 1, 2, 17\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that some acts of civil disobedience \"would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance.\" Rule 2 applies because Bedau notes that these acts may be \"entirely symbolic\" and serve a propaganda purpose. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the purpose of \"illegal protests,\" indicating that the answer should consider the role of breaking the law. \nThe answer: serve a propaganda purpose", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Voice in the Wilderness", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 738 days", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Julia Butterfly Hill lived in the California Redwood tree for 738 days, successfully preventing it from being cut down. This implies that the outcome of living in the tree was the prevention of its destruction.\nThe answer: prevention of the tree's destruction.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 and 8 apply because they deal with comparisons. Rule 2 applies because it deals with degrees of a quality. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts. Rule 7 applies because it deals with synonyms. Rule 12 and 13 apply because they deal with irrelevant information. Rule 17 applies because it deals with negations. \nThe answer: a variety of different illegal acts", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: living in a California Redwood tree for 738 days to prevent it from being cut down", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage discusses acts of civil disobedience that are considered harmless and symbolic, and may not have a direct connection to the objectionable law. These acts are often seen as ineffective and absurd, but may serve a propaganda purpose. Therefore, the type of protests being referred to are those that are symbolic and harmless, but may serve a propaganda purpose. \nThe answer: symbolic", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking about goals that are achieved while breaking the law, which implies that the goals are not legal. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate answers related to those concepts. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate answers related to professions. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the goals achieved while breaking the law are not legal. \nThe answer: illegal goals", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Julia Butterfly Hill", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the reason why Joseph Haas was arrested, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 3 states that concepts such as behavior and speech are different, so we can infer that Joseph Haas was arrested for his speech. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can infer that \"arrested\" is synonymous with \"taken into custody\" or \"detained\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can infer that Joseph Haas was arrested for making a threatening statement towards government officials. \nThe answer: Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the Lebanon, New Hampshire city councilors stating, \"Wise up or die.\"", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the Lebanon, New Hampshire city councilors stating, 'Wise up or die.'\" Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for the content of the email, which is a form of speech. Rule 22 is relevant because it clarifies that \"Joseph Haas\" refers to the last entity mentioned in the paragraph. \nThe answer: \"Wise up or die.\"", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that civil disobedience can consist of engaging in forbidden speech, which implies that the speech is deemed as illegal or criminalized. The passage also mentions that engaging in threatening speech towards government officials is another way of expressing defiance towards the government. Therefore, the answer is \"illegal/criminalized\" or \"forbidden\". \nThe answer: illegal/criminalized or forbidden", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"led to\" implies a comparison between the broadcasting and the eventual outcome. Rule 7 applies because \"Some of\" is a synonym for \"the track\" and must be taken into account when identifying the specific content that led to the Supreme Court case. Rule 17 applies because the question is asking for the negative consequence of the broadcasting. \nThe answer: the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation.\nThe answer: 1978", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how civil disobedience can involve engaging in forbidden speech, which is a behavior that is hard to stop by authorities. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including behavior and speech. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for synonyms to be used in the question, such as \"behavior\" and \"conduct.\" Rule 17 is relevant because it acknowledges that negations are important for the answer, and the question asks for a behavior that is hard to stop, implying that authorities may try to stop it. \nThe answer: engaging in forbidden speech", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how civil disobedience can involve engaging in forbidden speech, such as broadcasting a controversial track or threatening government officials. The question asks for a way to use pure speech to reach as many people as possible to protest, which is answered by the example of broadcasting the \"Filthy Words\" track on WBAI. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps to understand that broadcasting the track was a way to reach a large audience. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concept of speech and the concept of behavior. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms in the question. Rule 17 is relevant because it acknowledges that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: broadcasting controversial speech", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: To protest against the government in an individual way, one can engage in forbidden speech or threaten government officials. This is stated in the passage and does not involve any comparisons or complex concepts. The question contains the synonym \"protest\" for \"expressing defiance toward the government.\" Negations are important in this question because it asks for a way to protest, not comply with the government. \nThe answer: Engage in forbidden speech or threaten government officials.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses civil disobedience and gives examples of how it can be expressed through speech, including broadcasting forbidden speech and threatening government officials. The question specifically asks about digital civil disobedience, which is not mentioned in the passage. However, the rule that negations are important for the answer allows us to focus on the word \"one\" in the question, indicating that there may be multiple ways of digital civil disobedience. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers that refer to those concepts. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"speech\" or \"threatening government officials\" in the passage. The answer is \"engaging in forbidden speech\" or \"sending threatening emails.\" \n\nThe answer: Engaging in forbidden speech or sending threatening emails.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The mentioned forms of civil disobedience make it more difficult for a system to function.\nThe answer: the functioning of a system", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Plowshares organization used sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes at GCSB Waihopai.\nThe answer: using sickles to deflate a dome", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: padlocking the gates", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: employ limited coercion", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: When large groups of people boycott a system or don't pay taxes, it can be considered a form of civil disobedience that makes it more difficult for the system to function. This is because the system relies on the participation and financial support of the people. Additionally, this answer follows rule 3, which states that size is a different concept from other concepts like color or shape.", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions various forms of civil disobedience, but the question specifically asks for a type of disobedience against the federal government. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any mention of disobedience against a specific nationality. Rule 7 reminds us to look for synonyms, and \"federal government\" can be replaced with \"system\" in the context. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we can eliminate any mention of obedience or compliance. \nThe answer: draft dodging", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how some forms of civil disobedience can make it more difficult for a system to function, which could be considered coercive. However, the author notes that civil disobedients aim to engage in moral dialogue and may only use limited coercion to get their issue onto the table. The passage does not mention any specific unfortunate side effect of these types of protests.\nThe answer: N/A", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that civil disobedience can make it more difficult for a system to function, which implies that the goal of many of these protests is to disrupt or challenge the system in some way. Additionally, the passage notes that civil disobedients aim to engage in moral dialogue, suggesting that their goal is to bring attention to a particular issue or cause. \nThe answer: to disrupt or challenge the system and bring attention to a particular issue or cause.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses various forms of civil disobedience that can be considered non-violent, such as illegal boycotts, sit-ins, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. Rule 1 applies to the comparison of different forms of civil disobedience. Rule 2 applies to the use of limited coercion in some cases. Rule 3 applies to the distinction between different concepts, such as civil disobedience and violence. Rule 4 applies to the distinction between profession and action. Rule 5 applies to the distinction between animals and actions. Rule 6 applies to the distinction between animals and vehicles. Rule 7 applies to the use of synonyms in the question. Rule 8 applies to the importance of negations in the question. Rule 17 applies to the importance of negations in the answer. \nThe answer: Non-violent forms of civil disobedience include illegal boycotts, sit-ins, and distributed denial-of-service attacks.", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how civil disobedience cases involve decisions and principles that are similar to those in other criminal investigations and arrests. The question asks specifically about the type of government investigations that apply to civil disobedience, and the relevant rules are 3 (distinguishing between concepts), 4 (distinguishing between profession and nationality), 7 (synonyms in the question), and 17 (negations in the question). \nThe answer: criminal investigations", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how some civil disobedients seek to use their arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. This can be seen as a way to show civil disobedience. Additionally, the passage mentions that some civil disobedients may choose to talk to police officers, which is generally believed to be harmful and serves no useful purpose. However, this is not a way to show civil disobedience, as it goes against the principles of civil disobedience. \nThe answer: Making an impression on the officers.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18}\nExplanation: When talking to authorities, it is generally agreed within the legal community that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. Therefore, it should be avoided.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses reasons why civil disobedients may find it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, including a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications and a desire to make an impression on the officers. However, it is generally agreed that talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose and may be harmful. Therefore, failure to resist talking to investigators can be a reason for failure of the disobedience with authorities. \nThe answer: Talking to investigators or a lack of resistance to talking to investigators.", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the reason why some people resist officers of the law, implying that resisting officers is seen as a negative behavior. Rule 7 applies because \"purposely resist\" is a synonym for \"civil disobedience,\" which is mentioned in the article. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the reason why some people resist officers of the law, implying that there may be a negation involved. \nThe answer: Some people purposely resist officers of the law as a form of civil disobedience.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the validity of the social contract and the obligation to obey laws or suffer penalties.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that some civil disobedients feel it is necessary to accept punishment as a consequence of breaking the law, as they believe in the social contract that binds individuals to obey the laws established by a legitimate government. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"belief\" are different from concepts such as \"size\" or \"shape\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Because of their belief in the validity of the social contract.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the legitimacy of their particular government or a particular law it has enacted", "{4, 18}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a profession. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negative statement. The answer is \"anarchists\". \nThe answer: anarchists", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Anarchists do not believe in the legitimacy of any government, so they do not see the need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others. The relevant rules are 3 (distinguishing between concepts), 4 (distinguishing between profession and nationality), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: They do not believe in the legitimacy of any government.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the debate over whether civil disobedients should plead guilty or not guilty. Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between pleading guilty and submitting to punishment prescribed by law. Rule 2 applies because it establishes a relationship between pleading guilty and feeling proud of committing the act. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for an \"important personal decision,\" and the decision to plead guilty or not guilty is a personal decision. \nThe answer: Whether or not to plead guilty.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a duty that some people believe civil disobedients have, which implies that others may believe differently. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about a belief held by some people, which is related to their ideology or philosophy. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a duty that some people believe civil disobedients have, which implies that others may not believe it. \nThe answer: Some people believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: One argument is that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law. Another argument is that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. However, either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. \nThe answer: One might plead guilty to show that they committed the act of which they are accused and are proud of it.", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that some civil disobedients believe that pleading not guilty sends a message that they have done no wrong, even if they have violated specific laws. This implies a negation of guilt, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: To send a message that they have done no wrong.", "{7, 8, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: These rules are relevant because they deal with synonyms, negations, typos, and irrelevant passages in the question. They help to identify that the question is asking for a specific type of plea that uses creative words. \nThe answer: plea of no contest", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of a protest that took place in Las Vegas. The relevant information is that the protest was sponsored by the Committee for Non-Violent Action and took place in August 1957 at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada. Rule 3 states that location is a different concept from other concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which is relevant in this case as \"location\" is a synonym for \"where.\" Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the focus should be on the information about the protest and its location. Rule 13 states that locations are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Camp Mercury nuclear test site.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: attempted entry into the test site", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The protesters were found \"guilty\" and given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for how the lawyer suggested the protesters should plea. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the phrase \"suggest they would plea\" which is synonymous with \"advise them to plead\". Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the suggestion made by the lawyer, which is a negation. \nThe answer: \"nolo contendere\"", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the protesters were \"given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.\" This means that they were not immediately imprisoned but were instead given a punishment that would be enforced if they violated the conditions of their sentence. The use of the word \"suspended\" indicates that the sentences were not currently being carried out but could be in the future. The phrase \"conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds\" indicates that the sentences were contingent on the protesters not returning to the site. \nThe answer: suspended sentences", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Protesters may choose to go to jail as a way of continuing their protest and reminding their countrymen of injustice, but it is not necessary to do so as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. Going to jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is seen as switching suddenly to a spirit of subservience and demeaning the seriousness of the protest. \nThe answer: To continue their protest and remind their countrymen of injustice.", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"protesters choose to go to jail\" implies that going to jail is seen as a negative consequence, and therefore, avoiding it is desirable. Rule 3 applies because \"going to jail\" and \"accomplishing a goal\" are different concepts. Rule 4 applies because \"going to jail\" and \"nationality\" are different concepts. Rule 8 applies because \"going to jail\" and \"accomplishing a goal\" are antonyms. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the negation of a statement in the context. \nThe answer: Going to jail does not accomplish a goal of civil disobedience.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: Civil disobedience should maintain the spirit of protest all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest. Negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Maintaining the spirit of protest", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage argues that going to jail as a part of a rule connected with civil disobedience is a form of subservience and undermines the seriousness of the protest. Therefore, one should not go to jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules'. \nThe answer: The passage does not provide a clear answer to the question.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a punishment that is offered, implying that it is more lenient than the punishment that would be given if the defendant went to trial. Rule 2 applies because the question mentions that the plea bargain may involve no jail time, implying that the punishment offered is the least severe option. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a punishment that is sometimes offered, implying that it is not always offered. \nThe answer: a plea bargain with no jail time", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: A plea bargain is usually taken to avoid a harsher punishment. Rule 1 applies because avoiding a harsher punishment means receiving a less severe punishment. Rule 2 applies because a plea bargain is a way to achieve the least severe punishment possible. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the goal of taking a plea bargain, implying that it is not always successful. \nThe answer: avoid a harsher punishment", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions that in some mass arrest situations, activists use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of \"prosecution\" and focus on the concept of \"activists\" instead. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can recognize that \"negotiating\" is synonymous with \"using solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone.\" \nThe answer: Using solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the prosecution and civil disobedients. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different types of pleas. Rule 17 applies because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: blind plea", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: The rules selected ensure that we focus on the relevant information in the passage, including identifying the subject of the question (Mohandas Gandhi), understanding the concept of a plea bargain, and recognizing the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Mohandas Gandhi", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes how some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a speech in allocution, either to explain their actions or to make a defiant statement. This can be seen as a constructive way to perform civil disobedience, as it allows the defendant to express their beliefs and potentially raise awareness about their cause. Rule 1 applies because making a defiant speech implies that the defendant is more willing to stand up for their beliefs than to comply with the law. Rule 2 applies because making a speech in allocution can be seen as a way to express oneself most fully, while not making a speech can be seen as a way to avoid expressing oneself. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a way to perform civil disobedience in a constructive way, implying that some ways of performing civil disobedience may not be constructive. \nThe answer: Making a speech in allocution.", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: One may want to give a speech in allocution to explain their actions or to make a defiant statement. (rule 4: profession and nationality are different concepts, rule 12: some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer)\nThe answer: To explain their actions or to make a defiant statement.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar, the defendant's defiant speech during allocution resulted in an increased sentence because it suggested a lack of remorse and an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions. This shows that giving a defiant speech can be more harmful for the individual because it can lead to a harsher sentence. \nThe answer: It can lead to a harsher sentence.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes a case where a defendant's allocution speech led to an increase in her sentence. The reason for this was because her statement suggested a lack of remorse and an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions. This shows that lack of remorse can lead to more punishment. \nThe answer: Lack of remorse", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article does not provide information on the usual treatment of civil disobedients, but it does mention that some protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials in their allocution speeches. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in the question or the article. \nThe answer: The article does not provide information on the usual treatment of civil disobedients.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the primary goal of pleading not guilty, which implies that there may be other goals as well. Rule 4 applies because the question mentions civil disobedience, which is a political act and not a profession or nationality. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the primary goal, which implies that there may be other goals as well. \nThe answer: The primary goal of pleading not guilty when arrested for Civil Disobedience is to either win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a secondary goal, implying that there is a primary goal. Rule 2 applies because the question mentions using the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public, which implies that the primary goal is not necessarily to win an acquittal. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negation (secondary goal instead of primary goal). \nThe answer: to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a decision that civilly disobedient defendants must make. Rule 2 applies because the question mentions two possible goals for the defendants. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about what civilly disobedient defendants would do in court. \nThe answer: They must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience.", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions the Vietnam War era as a time when civil disobedience was prevalent, and the Chicago Eight used a political defense during this time. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, and the question is asking about a war, not a profession. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for synonyms to be used in the question, such as \"large amount\" instead of \"prevalent.\" Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"not excuse lawbreaking\"), which is important for understanding the context. \nThe answer: Vietnam War", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: nullify the charges", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if too much disobedience occurs, it can undermine the law. Rule 3 applies because disobedience is a concept separate from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 applies because civil disobedience should not lead to more disobedience. Rule 17 applies because the question asks what needs to be avoided. \nThe answer: Undermining the law.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article suggests that a great amount of disobedience would undermine the law, implying that disobedience by the general public should be avoided. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, meaning that the answer should not be related to any of these concepts.\nThe answer: to avoid undermining the law", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that \"disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law.\" Rule 2 applies because the article distinguishes between conscientious lawbreakers and those who break the law for self-gratification or to escape punishment. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a reason why civil disobedience is not recognized. \nThe answer: any great amount of disobedience would undermine the law", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses the concept of civil disobedience and argues that while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. This implies that someone should not commit a crime when they are protesting because it would undermine the law and not be of social benefit. Additionally, rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for a reason why someone should not commit a crime, not why they should. \nThe answer: It would undermine the law and not be of social benefit.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses different types of lawbreaking, including civil disobedience and illegal acts done for self-gratification or to avoid punishment. The question asks for a reason why someone would avoid crimes while protesting, implying that the person is engaging in civil disobedience and not breaking the law for personal gain. Therefore, rule 3 (distinguishing between concepts such as lawbreaking and protesting) and rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) are relevant. \nThe answer: To engage in civil disobedience rather than illegal acts for personal gain.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Indirect civil disobedience", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage distinguishes between two types of civil disobedience: indirect and direct. Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law. \nThe answer: direct civil disobedience", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific US war that caused civil disobedience. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a positive statement about a war causing civil disobedience. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to focus on the presence of the word \"high\" in the question. \nThe answer: Vietnam War", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the use of the \"necessity defense\" by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts. This defense is used to argue that breaking the law was necessary to prevent a greater harm. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including types of civil disobedience. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: the necessity defense", "{rule list: 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Leafleters have not been arrested because prosecutors have reasoned that if they arrest them, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence, which could potentially influence the jury's decision. This is in line with the fact that distributing educational leaflets inside courthouses is not illegal, as per rule 7, and that some irrelevant information about court cases is included in the passage, as per rule 12. Additionally, the use of the word \"not\" in the question indicates a negation, which is important for the answer, as per rule 17.\nThe answer: Prosecutors have reasoned that arresting them could potentially influence the jury's decision.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article does not mention civil disobedients specifically, but the general goal of criminal punishment is stated as achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the article does not mention civil disobedients specifically does not affect the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and the article does not contain any negations that would change the answer. \nThe answer: achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rules of 3 and 4 state that different concepts should not be confused, and profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks about the main goal of not using punishment, so the answer is that there is no goal, as punishment is necessary in a just system.", "{rule list: 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Protesters are not mentioned in the article, so we can eliminate irrelevant information by using rule 12. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any information about professions. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. Since the article does not mention protesters, we cannot answer the question.\nThe answer: Cannot be answered.", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer should focus on what the punishment should rely on instead of deterrence. Rules 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 help to eliminate irrelevant information. Rule 7 is important because it allows for synonyms to be used in the question. Rule 8 is important because it allows for the negation in the question to be considered. Rule 12 is important because it allows for irrelevant information to be eliminated. Rule 17 is important because it allows for negations to be considered in the answer.\nThe answer: The punishment should rely on moral reasons to follow the law, rather than the threat of punishment.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Construction is the process of building a structure or infrastructure on location for a known client, involving planning, design, financing, and continuing until the project is built and ready for use. This distinguishes it from manufacturing, which involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser. \nThe answer: the process of building a structure or infrastructure on location for a known client, involving planning, design, financing, and continuing until the project is built and ready for use.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser.\nThe answer: manufacturing", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Construction is an industry, which is a different concept from manufacturing. Therefore, rule 4 applies. The question asks for the percentage of GDP that construction comprises, which is a measure of size, so rule 3 applies. \nThe answer: 6 to 9 percent", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: Construction starts with planning, design, and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use.\nThe answer: planning, design, and financing", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that construction typically takes place on location for a known client, and the rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, the answer is \"a known client\".", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that the answer will not be a nationality, but rather a profession. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts tells us that the answer will not be a physical characteristic. Therefore, the answer must be a profession. The passage states that \"An architect normally manages the job,\" so the answer is architect.\nThe answer: architect", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The article mentions several possible job titles that could supervise a construction job, including construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer, and project manager. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific person's profession based on the information given. \nThe answer: N/A (cannot be determined from the article)", "{1, 3, 4, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the various factors that must be considered for the successful execution of a construction project, including planning, zoning requirements, environmental impact, scheduling, budgeting, safety, availability and transportation of materials, logistics, and public inconvenience. Rule 1 applies because effective planning is more important than any of the other factors mentioned. Rule 3 applies because size is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 applies because profession and discipline are different concepts. Rule 7 applies because synonyms may be used in the question. Rule 12 applies because irrelevant information is mentioned in the passage. Rule 17 applies because negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Effective planning", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects.\" This answer is straightforward and does not require any specific rules beyond understanding the meaning of the word \"megaprojects.\" Rule 3 is included to remind the reader that size is a distinct concept from other factors mentioned in the passage. Rule 12 is included to emphasize that irrelevant information should be ignored when extracting the answer. \nThe answer: megaprojects", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that those involved with the design and execution of infrastructure must consider zoning requirements, environmental impact, budgeting, and logistics. \nThe answer: architects, construction managers, design engineers, construction engineers, and project managers.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article explicitly states that there are three sectors of construction: buildings, infrastructure, and industrial.\nThe answer: buildings, infrastructure, and industrial.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found in the passage, which states that building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential (commercial/institutional). Therefore, the relevant rules are that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts (rule 3) and that the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph (rule 7). \nThe answer: residential and non-residential (commercial/institutional)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: \"Infrastructure is often called heavy/highway, heavy civil or heavy engineering.\" This answer follows rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \"Heavy/highway\" is a more specific term for infrastructure, while \"heavy civil\" and \"heavy engineering\" are more general terms. Therefore, \"heavy/highway\" is more X than \"heavy civil\" and \"heavy engineering,\" and \"heavy civil\" and \"heavy engineering\" are less X than \"heavy/highway.\" \nThe answer: heavy/highway", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Buildings, infrastructure, and industrial are the three sectors of construction. Infrastructure includes large public works, dams, bridges, highways, water/wastewater, and utility distribution.\nThe answer: infrastructure", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" and the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" do not apply to this question. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"industrial includes refineries, process chemical, power generation, mills and manufacturing plants\" and the rule that \"refineries, process chemical, power generation, mills and manufacturing plants are under the industrial sector of construction.\" \nThe answer: Industrial.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Engineering News-Record is a trade magazine for the construction industry.\nThe answer: a trade magazine for the construction industry.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Engineering News-Record (ENR)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2014", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the specific market segments listed (transportation, sewer, hazardous waste, and water) are important for the answer. Names and locations are not relevant. \nThe answer: data on transportation, sewer, hazardous waste, and water", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article divides the construction sector into three subsectors: building construction, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors.\nThe answer: building construction, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions categories for \"construction service firms (e.g., engineering, architecture) and construction managers.\" These categories are different from the three subsectors of construction mentioned earlier in the passage. \nThe answer: construction service firms and construction managers", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article discusses the Standard Industrial Classification and North American Industry Classification System, which have a classification system for companies in the construction sector. \nThe answer: the Standard Industrial Classification and North American Industry Classification System", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: Construction managers are firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project. This falls under the category of construction service firms, which are firms that provide services such as engineering and architecture for construction projects. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and since construction managers are not a nationality, this rule is not relevant. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, but since there are no specific names mentioned in the article, this rule is also not relevant.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: building construction", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two things that are more or less of a certain quality. In this case, the article states that the majority of building construction jobs are small renovations, which implies that there are some jobs that are not small renovations. Rule 3 applies because it establishes that size is a different concept from other aspects of building construction. \nThe answer: small renovations", "{3, 4, 19}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Therefore, the answer is \"the owner of the property.\" \nThe answer: the owner of the property.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for examples of undesirable end results, which is the opposite of a positive outcome. The answer is: structural collapse, cost overruns, and/or litigation.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about them is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that \"those in the field\" refers to people with experience in building construction. Rule 23 states that those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome. \nThe answer: Make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how residential construction must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice, which fall under the category of rules and regulations set by the government (i.e. profession). Additionally, the passage mentions that the materials used in construction are dictated by what is readily available in the area, which falls under the category of physical properties (i.e. shape, size, and color). \nThe answer: local building authority regulations and codes of practice", "{rules 3 and 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used.\" This means that the availability of materials is the main factor that determines the construction materials used.\nThe answer: availability of materials", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Residential construction (as well as all other types of construction) can generate a lot of waste, careful planning again is needed here.\" This indicates that if residential construction is not carefully planned, it can generate waste.\nThe answer: waste", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The rules state that site conditions, local regulations, and economies of scale can affect the cost of construction, while the availability of skilled tradespeople can also affect the construction materials used. \nThe answer: the cost and materials used in residential construction.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses new techniques of building construction that are made possible by advances in 3D printing technology.\nThe answer: advances in 3D printing technology", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that building printing can construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours, with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities, in one continuous build, using large 3D printers. Therefore, the answer is 20 hours.\nThe answer: around 20 hours", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the building is scheduled to be built in 2014, which is a specific point in time. Therefore, rule 3 (age) and rule 6 (animals and vehicles are different concepts) apply. Rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is also relevant as the name of the architect is mentioned last in the sentence. \nThe answer: 2014.", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that as of January 2013, working versions of 3D-printing building technology are already printing 2 meters of building material per hour. This means that the technology is capable of printing more than 2 meters per hour, but the exact amount is not specified. Therefore, we can use rule 2 to infer that the next-generation printers are capable of printing 3.5 meters per hour. \nThe answer: 2 meters per hour (as of January 2013)", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that a formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings and integrate those proceedings with other parts. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply to differentiate between the concepts of profession and shape/size/color, and to emphasize that a person's profession is not related to their gender. Rule 16 applies to determine that the answer should describe what the design team is assembled to do. \nThe answer: plan the physical proceedings and integrate those proceedings with other parts.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: designs into reality", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the design team is most commonly employed by the property owner.\nThe answer: property owner", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the process of construction, which involves a design team creating drawings and specifications. A quantity surveyor may then provide a bill of quantities, which is used by construction companies to make a bid for the work. Therefore, the answer is a quantity surveyor.\nThe answer: a quantity surveyor", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The owner is not a person with a profession, but rather the entity that owns the property being constructed. The answer is \"the most cost efficient bidder.\"", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the trend towards integration to the past separation of specialties. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the different specialties involved in design. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between profession and specialty. \nThe answer: previously separated specialties", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that in the past, these professions were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in larger firms. Therefore, even in large firms, these professions were likely to be separate companies.\nThe answer: separate companies", "{3, 4, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how modern firms in the design industry integrate previously separated specialties, such as architecture, interior design, engineering, and construction management, to offer \"one-stop shopping\" for a construction project from beginning to end. This is known as a \"design build\" contract. \nThe answer: \"one-stop shopping\"", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the type of contract given when a contractor is responsible for the entire construction project from design to construction while adhering to performance specifications. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is also not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the contractor is responsible for the entire project, then it is not a contract where the responsibilities are divided among different parties. Therefore, the answer is a \"design build\" contract. \nThe answer: design build contract", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage discusses three project structures that can assist the owner in integration: design-build, partnering, and construction management. These structures allow for the integration of various services throughout the design and construction process. \nThe answer: design-build, partnering, and construction management", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two entities based on a comparative attribute. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts. The answer is: architects, interior designers, engineers, and constructors.", "{4, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 6 (animals and vehicles are different concepts), and 13 (names are equally important for the answer). The question asks about what construction companies are placing more emphasis on, which implies a change in their behavior. Therefore, the answer must be a new emphasis or focus. The passage states that companies are \"placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process.\" Therefore, the answer is \"establishing relationships with other necessary participants.\"", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If A is more expensive than B, then B is less expensive than A. This applies to financial problems in construction projects, such as underbids and cash flow problems. The answer is: preventable financial problems.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: An underbid happens when builders ask for too little money to complete the project, meaning that they bid less than what is necessary to complete the project. \nThe answer: When builders ask for too little money to complete the project.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labor and materials, regardless of whether the overall total is enough. This is a case of antonym(X) where having sufficient funds is the opposite of lacking funds. \nThe answer: when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labor and materials", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify a financial issue that is prevalent in the construction field. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any options related to a specific country or region. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we need to look for synonyms of \"financial issue\". Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negative words. The answer is \"fraud\". \nThe answer: Fraud.", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions mortgage bankers, accountants, and cost engineers as likely participants in creating a financial management plan for building construction projects.\nThe answer: Mortgage bankers, accountants, and cost engineers.", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates nationality as a possible answer. The rule that \"a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession\" allows us to use the pronoun \"who\" without specifying a gender. The rule that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names\" and \"his\" refer to male names and \"her\" refer to female names\" are also irrelevant since no names are given.\nThe answer: mortgage banker", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that accountants are responsible for studying the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and monitoring payouts throughout the process. This falls under the concept of profession (accountant) and is not related to nationality or gender. \nThe answer: accountants", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid. This means that when the contractor made changes that increased costs and were not subject to competition, cost overruns occurred. The answer is \"identified change orders or project changes that increased costs\". \nThe answer: identified change orders or project changes that increased costs", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the roles of various professionals in creating a financial plan for building construction projects. Cost engineers and estimators are mentioned as the ones who apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation. This falls under rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts.\nThe answer: Cost engineers and estimators", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements, which are legal requirements. Negations are important for the answer because the question asks what the project must adhere to, not what it must not do.\nThe answer: zoning and building code requirements", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two entities based on a comparative attribute. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that size and benefit are different concepts. \nThe answer: the owner", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Malum in se considerations refer to legal requirements that come from the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad, such as bridge collapses or explosions. This is a negation rule (17) and pertains to legal concepts (3).\nThe answer: Legal requirements that come from the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Malum prohibitum considerations are legal requirements that come from things that are a matter of custom or expectation, such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about who may seek changes or exemptions in the law, which implies a legal aspect. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so knowing the profession of the person seeking changes or exemptions is irrelevant. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"may\" in the question. Combining these rules, we can infer that anyone, including an attorney, may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built. \nThe answer: An attorney or anyone.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage explains that a construction project involves multiple contracts and legal obligations that all parties must consider. This involves exchanging a set of obligations between two or more parties. Clear expectations and paths to accomplishing those expectations are necessary for a smooth project flow. \nThe answer: A construction project involves a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, then B is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the concept of an exchange of obligations is different from concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: A contract", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that time is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color (rule 3) is relevant because it establishes that the time element in construction is a distinct concept that must be considered separately. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A (rule 8) is also relevant because it helps us understand that if a delay in construction is costly, then not having a delay is valuable. \nThe answer: A delay costs money.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the contracts must ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out, which implies that if one side is more capable than the other, the contract must be adjusted accordingly. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the purpose or goal of designing contracts, which is to set clear expectations and paths to accomplishing those expectations. \nThe answer: ensure clear expectations and paths to accomplishing those expectations.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the absence of clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations leads to confusion and collapse.\nThe answer: poorly drafted contracts", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage discusses new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting and co-operative relationships between stakeholders in construction projects. This implies a shift away from highly competitive and adversarial practices. \nThe answer: co-operative relationships between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project.", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: PPP stands for Public-Private Partnering, which is also known as private finance initiatives (PFIs). This is a form of procurement that involves a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project. \nThe answer: Public-Private Partnering (also known as PFIs) is a form of procurement that involves a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project.", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: Since \"PPPs\" is an acronym, we need to find a synonym for it. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that acronyms and their expanded forms are also different concepts. Therefore, \"PPPs\" and \"private finance initiatives (PFIs)\" are different concepts, and \"PPPs\" is a synonym for \"private finance initiatives (PFIs)\". \nThe answer: private finance initiatives (PFIs)", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage discusses new forms of procurement in the construction industry that emphasize co-operative relationships between stakeholders, such as partnering and alliances, in order to address problems caused by competitive and adversarial practices. \nThe answer: co-operation", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The passage describes the most common method of construction procurement, in which the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator. This is a direct contractual relationship between the architect's client and the main contractor. \nThe answer: the architect or engineer", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the role of a specific entity in relation to other entities involved in construction procurement. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about a specific role, which is a profession and not a nationality. \nThe answer: the architect or engineer", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts and the rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts are not relevant to this question. The answer can be found in the sentence \"There are direct contractual links between the architect's client and the main contractor.\" Therefore, the answer is between the architect's client and the main contractor. \nThe answer: the architect's client and the main contractor.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is relevant because it establishes that the profession of the main contractor is not relevant to the answer. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is also relevant because it establishes that the main contractor comes before any subcontractor. \nThe answer: the main contractor", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: This question asks for the end point of the construction procurement procedure described in the article. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is also not relevant to this question. Therefore, no rules apply to this question.\nThe answer: the building is ready to occupy.", "{rule list: 1, 13}\nExplanation: The owner produces a list of requirements for a project\nThe answer: The owner", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: The D&B contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish the project's goals, and the owner selects the best ideas and hires the appropriate contractor(s).\nThe answer: D&B contractors", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor.\nThe answer: The owner", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"it is not just one contractor, but a consortium of several contractors working together.\" This means that multiple contractors are working together. Additionally, the passage mentions that \"Once these have been hired, they begin building the first phase of the project.\" This implies that the contractors are the ones working together. \nThe answer: several contractors", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: they design phase 2", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the contractors are required to verify and have the utility lines marked, indicating that the utility lines are more important than the contractors. Rule 3 applies because the verification and marking of utility lines is related to their location, which is a different concept from the contractors' profession. \nThe answer: contractors", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if having existing utility lines marked lessens the likelihood of damage to the facilities, then not having them marked increases the likelihood of damage. Rule 3 applies because damage and likelihood are different concepts. \nThe answer: damage to existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities\" as examples of utility lines that contractors are required to verify and mark before digging. \nThe answer: electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code.\nThe answer: municipal building inspector", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed, an occupancy permit may be issued.\" This indicates that an occupancy permit is issued once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed. \nThe answer: An occupancy permit.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the revenue, which is a measure of size. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific concept. \nThe answer: $960 billion", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about what \"private\" means in this context. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" allows us to understand that if $680 billion is private, then the remainder (government revenue) is not private. \nThe answer: $680 billion", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the number of firms mentioned first in the passage refers to the number of firms in 2005. Rule 22 states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\", which means that the number of general contractors mentioned first is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: about 667,000 firms", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the average contractor employed fewer than 10 employees.\" \nThe answer: fewer than 10", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that approximately 828,000 women were employed in the construction industry as of 2011.\nThe answer: 828,000", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The article compares the average earning for a professional in the construction industry in the Middle East to that in the UK, indicating a difference in salary. Rule 1 applies because the article states that the Middle East yields higher average salaries than the UK. Rule 2 applies because the article provides specific numbers for the average earning in the Middle East and the UK, making it possible to determine that the Middle East has the highest average salary. \nThe answer: \u00a342,090", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the average earning for a professional in the construction industry in the Middle East is \u00a342,090, compared to \u00a326,719 in the UK. Therefore, the UK has a lower average construction salary than the Middle East.\nThe answer: \u00a326,719", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"salary\" and \"location\" are different concepts (rule 3) is relevant because the question is asking about a specific location where workers have made a certain amount of money. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A (rule 8) is relevant because the question is asking about a location where workers have made a higher salary than in other locations. \nThe answer: US/Canada", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that construction is more dangerous than any other sector and the rule that danger is a different concept from other factors like size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: Construction.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A help to eliminate other possible answers such as electrocution, transportation accidents, and trench cave-ins.\nThe answer: Falls", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the other causes of fatalities in the construction industry. Rule 3 reminds us that different concepts such as falls, electrocution, transportation accidents, and trench cave-ins should not be confused. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and cause of death are different concepts. Rule 5 reminds us that accidents involving vehicles and animals are different concepts. Rule 6 reminds us that accidents involving vehicles and animals are different concepts. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: electrocution, transportation accidents, and trench cave-ins.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the use of proper safety equipment and procedures can reduce the risk of occupational injuries, so they are more effective at curbing the risk than not using them. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Proper safety equipment and procedures such as harnesses, guardrails, securing ladders, and inspecting scaffolding.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private schools are also known as independent schools.\nThe answer: Independent schools", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that private schools may offer scholarships based on \"a talent the student may have (e.g. sport scholarship, art scholarship, academic scholarship).\" Therefore, the answer is academic. \nThe answer: academic", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Private schools are not funded by mandatory taxation through public (government) funding, but instead are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition. This follows rule 1, which states that if A is not X, then B is X. It also follows rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and therefore funding source (taxation) and administration (government) are also different concepts. \nThe answer: tuition", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private schools have the right to select their students, while public schools do not.\nThe answer: Select their students.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Annual tuition fees at K-12 schools range from nothing at so called 'tuition-free' schools to more than $45,000 at several New England preparatory schools.\" This indicates that some notable prep schools in New England have yearly tuition fees of more than $45,000.\nThe answer: more than $45,000", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: Private schools that charge no tuition are called \"tuition-free\" schools.\nThe answer: Tuition-free schools.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" applies because the question is asking about a country, not a profession. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" does not apply because none of these concepts are mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: United States", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the term \"private schools\" refers to universities based on the context. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is irrelevant to the question. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the region that does not use the term \"private schools\" to refer to universities. \nThe answer: None, the article states that the term \"private schools\" is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions in the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries including Australia and Canada.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: lower sixth", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"year twelve is known as lower sixth and year 13 (upper sixth).\" This means that \"upper sixth\" is another term used for year 13.\nThe answer: upper sixth", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private secondary schools can be categorized as university-preparatory schools or \"prep schools\". \nThe answer: Prep schools", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the factor that influences private school tuition is not related to size, shape, age, or color, so we can eliminate those options. However, the question mentions \"the willingness of parents to pay\", which is a positive statement, so we need to use the antonym of \"willingness\", which is \"unwillingness\". Therefore, the answer is \"unwillingness of parents to pay\". \nThe answer: unwillingness of parents to pay", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that high tuition is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about who receives higher salaries, which is related to the profession of the teachers. \nThe answer: the best teachers", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The article states that the term \"parochial schools\" is often used to denote Roman Catholic schools. This indicates that the term generally refers to schools affiliated with the Roman Catholic religion.\nThe answer: Roman Catholic schools", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: Private schools can be religiously affiliated or denominational. The article lists several religious groups that operate private schools, including Muslims, Jews, and Protestant Christians. Therefore, the answer is not a specific denomination, but rather the broader category of Protestant Christians. \nThe answer: Protestant Christians", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"religion\" is a different concept from \"academics\" (rule 3) and the rule that \"profession\" is a different concept from \"religion\" (rule 4) are relevant here. The answer is religious education. \nThe answer: Religious education.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Private schools have the power of expulsion, which is not readily available to government schools.\nThe answer: power of expulsion", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"color\" is a different concept from \"profession\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer\" is also not relevant. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is not relevant because there is no comparison being made. The rule that \"a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession\" is also not relevant. The relevant rules are that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\" These rules apply because the question is asking for an example of a specific article of clothing, which is a different concept from size, shape, and age. The answer is \"blazer.\"", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Private schools are always more expensive than public schools.\nThe answer: more expensive", "{3, 4, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses different types of independent schools in Australia, including those affiliated with religious foundations. The question specifically asks about which religious denomination operates private schools in Australia, which falls under rule 4. Rule 3 is relevant to note that religion is a different concept than school type. Rule 12 is relevant to ignore the irrelevant information about specific schools. Rule 13 is relevant to note that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Presbyterian Church", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: St Joseph's College is a Catholic school, which falls under the category of independent schools that belong to religious foundations but do not insist on their students' religious allegiance. Therefore, we use rule 4 to identify that profession and religion are different concepts, and rule 20 to determine that \"St Joseph's College\" is referred to as \"it\" and not \"he\" or \"she\". \nThe answer: Catholic", "{rule list: 4, 13, 16}\nExplanation: St Aloysius' College is a Catholic school, which falls under the category of 'elite schools'. It is located in Sydney. \nThe answer: Sydney", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Loreto Normanhurst is a girls' school, so the answer must refer to a female student.\nThe answer: female students attend Loreto Normanhurst.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz. \nThe answer: Article 7, Paragraph 4", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a percentage, which is a measure of size. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts like age or color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, to answer the question, we need to focus on the percentage of students in private schools. The answer is 7.8%.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the percentage of Germans attending private high schools in 2008. The passage states that the percent of students in private high schools reached 11.1%. The passage does not specify if this percentage refers to all students in Germany or only a specific region, so we cannot assume that it refers to all Germans. Therefore, we must use rule 3 to understand that the percentage of students in private high schools is not the same as the percentage of Germans attending private high schools. We must also use rule 8 to understand that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is: 11.1% of students in private high schools, but we cannot determine the percentage of Germans attending private high schools from this information.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: We need to find the percentage of East German students attending private schools in 1992. The passage states that the percentage of pupils in private schools in Germany increased from 6.1% to 7.8% between 1992 and 2008, and that the rise in the former GDR was from 0.5% to 6.1%. Using rule 1, we can infer that the percentage of East German students attending private schools in 1992 was less than 6.1%. Using rule 17, we can infer that the answer to the question is the negation of the statement that the rise in the former GDR was from 0.5% to 6.1%, which is that the percentage of East German students attending private schools in 1992 was 0.5% or less. Therefore, the answer is 0.5%. \nThe answer: 0.5%", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Sonderungsverbot, which forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents. This is a term for segregating students based on their parents' wealth.\nThe answer: Sonderungsverbot", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Private schools in Germany are called Ersatzschulen.\nThe answer: Ersatzschulen", "{rule list: 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: German Ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships, compared to most other Western European countries. This is due to the fact that they must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and teachers at Ersatzschulen must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as teachers at public schools. However, it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees, which is why all German Ersatzschulen are additionally financed with public funds. \nThe answer: German private schools have lower tuition fees compared to private schools in most other Western European countries.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private secondary schools in Germany are called Erg\u00e4nzungsschulen.\nThe answer: Erg\u00e4nzungsschulen", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. These rules are relevant because they help us understand that the type of school is a different concept from the ownership and funding of the school. Therefore, the answer is vocational schools.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Erg\u00e4nzungsschulen are funded by charging their students tuition fees, indicating that they are not funded by the government. This aligns with rule 3, which states that funding sources are different concepts from the type of school, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts and therefore do not apply to this question.\nThe answer: by charging tuition fees", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: Private individuals, private organizations, and religious groups sometimes run erg\u00e4nzungsschulen.\nThe answer: religious groups", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private schools in India are referred to as independent schools, but they can be aided or unaided. In a strict sense, a private school is an unaided independent school. \nThe answer: independent school", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Private schools in India are called independent schools, and there are 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates. The question asks for a notable Examination Board in multiple Indian states, and the answer is the CBSE.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are 30 different Examination Boards in India. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that private schools in India are not the same as independent schools, and rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the number of Examination Boards is a specific quantity. \nThe answer: 30", "{3, 12, 16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that both the union government and state governments have the power to govern schools in India, but the union government provides the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations. This means that the answer to the question is the union government. \nThe answer: union government", "{3, 4, 12}\nExplanation: The article states that only non-profit trusts and societies can run schools in India, so rule 4 is not relevant. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the parts about corruption and academic achievement. The answer is: no other non-profits are mentioned as being allowed to run schools in India.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the country with the most illiterate adults, which is a fact stated in the passage. Rules 3 and 8 are relevant because they remind us that size and age are different concepts, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: India", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the full name of the ASER, which is a specific acronym mentioned in the article. Rule 3 states that concepts such as names and acronyms are important for the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, but in this case, there are no synonyms used. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \n\nThe answer: Annual Status of Education Report", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The ASER evaluates learning levels in rural India.\nThe answer: to evaluate learning levels in rural India", "{3, 19}\nExplanation: Private schools teach classes in English.\nThe answer: English", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we need to look for a synonym for \"private schools\" in the article. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any names mentioned in the article. The answer: scoil phr\u00edobh\u00e1ideach.", "{3, 4, 5, 17}\nExplanation: Private schools in Ireland differ from most in that a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the state, and they must still work towards state-mandated education standards. Additionally, many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. This is in contrast to private schools in other countries where teacher salaries are typically paid entirely by the school and there may not be state-mandated education standards. The negation in the question (\"differ\") is also important to note. \nThe answer: A certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the state, they must still work towards state-mandated education standards, and many also double as boarding schools.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the average fee for most Irish private schools is around \u20ac5,000 annually, but some schools that provide boarding may have fees up to \u20ac25,000 per year.\nThe answer: \u20ac5,000 annually for most schools", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The relevant rule is that \"names are equally important for the answer.\" The answer is the Society of Jesus.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the average fee is around \u20ac5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to \u20ac25,000 per year.\" This means that the fees for an Irish boarding school may rise up to \u20ac25,000 per year.\nThe answer: \u20ac25,000 per year.", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the year of Malaysia's independence, which is a comparison between before and after independence. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific year. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"after\") which is important for understanding the answer.\nThe answer: 1957", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Chinese primary schools in Malaysia are allowed to retain Chinese as the medium of instruction. The negation in the question is important, as it asks for the language used in Chinese primary schools, not in other types of schools. \nThe answer: Chinese", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"language\" and \"medium of instruction\" are different concepts applies here. Additionally, rule 8 applies because the question asks about a comparison between Chinese and English. \nThe answer: English", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rules of \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" are not relevant to this question. Rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer, is relevant because the question asks for the name of the government school system, implying that there may be other school systems in Malaysia. The answer is \"National School system\". \nThe answer: National School system", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of schools is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if some Chinese schools became National Type schools, then the rest did not. Therefore, the answer is \"over 60\". \n\nThe answer: over 60", "{rule list: 4}\nExplanation: Schools that receive government assistance are called \"aided\" schools.\nThe answer: aided schools", "1, 4, 8\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because 'un-aided' schools are fully funded by private parties, while 'aided' schools accept government funds. Rule 4 applies because the funding source (private individuals/organizations/religious groups vs. government) is related to the concept of ownership, not nationality. Rule 8 applies because 'un-aided' schools are more independent than 'aided' schools, which have some level of government support. \nThe answer: 'Un-aided' schools are fully funded by private parties, while 'aided' schools accept government funds.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Galaxy Public School is located in Kathmandu.\nThe answer: Kathmandu", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the medium of education in Nepalese private schools is English, but Nepali and/or the state's official language is also taught as a compulsory subject.\nThe answer: English", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private schools in Nepal teach Nepali and/or the state's official language in addition to English.\nThe answer: Nepali and/or the state's official language", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Private schools in New Zealand are discussed in the passage, and the passage states that \"as of April 2014, there are 88 private schools in New Zealand.\" The passage also notes that private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s, but this information is not directly relevant to the question.\nThe answer: 88", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Private school numbers and their decline are mentioned in the article, but only the number of students attending private schools in April 2014 is relevant to the question. The order of the information in the article is chronological, so the answer can be found at the beginning of the first sentence. \nThe answer: 28,000 students", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that private schools cater for around 3.7% of the entire student population in New Zealand as of April 2014. This means that the percentage of students attending private schools is less than the percentage of students attending public schools. \nThe answer: 3.7%", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the integration of Catholic schools (religion) into public schools is not related to the profession of the individuals involved. Negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for the religion whose schools were integrated, not which religion's schools remained private. \nThe answer: Catholic schools", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for one of the largest cities in New Zealand. Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept from other factors like location or age. Rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer. Therefore, we can identify the answer by looking for the names of cities mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: Auckland", "{rule list: 4}\nExplanation: The rule states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so affiliation with a denomination is not related to profession or nationality. \nThe answer: Anglican", "{rule list: locations are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of a specific school, so the relevant rule is that locations are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Wellington", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: Saint Kentigern College is a private school, and the question is asking about its denomination. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, but denomination is not a profession or nationality. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the mention of other private schools and the Catholic schismatic group can be ignored. \nThe answer: Presbyterian", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rangi Ruru Girls' School is a private school in Christchurch, as stated in the article. Christchurch is the last city mentioned in the list of cities where private schools are located, following the order of appearance in the article. Therefore, the answer is Christchurch. \nThe answer: Christchurch", "{rule list: 4, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) is relevant because it distinguishes between the operator of the school and their religious affiliation. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" (23) is relevant because the question is asking for the operator of the school, which is the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: the Catholic schismatic group, the Society of St Pius X", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Private schools account for 7.5% of primary enrollment, so public schools account for the remaining percentage. This is an example of rule 3, which states that size is a different concept from other concepts like profession or nationality. Additionally, the question asks for the percentage of students in private schools, so the use of the word \"private\" implies that the answer is not referring to public schools. This is an example of rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.\nThe answer: 7.5%", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the percentage of students attending private schools, which implies that the rest attend public schools. Therefore, if private schools account for 32% of secondary enrollment, then public schools account for the remaining 68%. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about secondary school students, and the passage provides percentages for primary, secondary, and tertiary enrollment. \nThe answer: 32%", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the percentage of tertiary enrollment in private schools, which is a comparison between private and public schools. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a numerical value, which is a different concept than the type of educational services provided. \nThe answer: 80%", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the specific information in the passage that mentions the release of the revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools. The passage states that the manual was issued \"in August 1992.\" Therefore, the answer is: August 1992. \nThe answer: August 1992.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the subject that replaced values education for fourth year students. Rule 3 tells us that subjects are different concepts from each other. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we need to look for a synonym for \"values education\". Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that values education was replaced by something else. \nThe answer: natural science", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it helps us understand that if students are turned away from public high schools due to enrollment overflows, then those schools have more students than they can accommodate. Rule 3 is relevant because it helps us understand that \"tuition and other school fees\" are different concepts. Rule 7 is relevant because \"financial assistance\" is a synonym for \"assistance.\" \nThe answer: Education Service Contracting scheme", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Tuition Fee Supplement", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: The article mentions the Private Education Student Financial Assistance, which is available to underprivileged high school graduates who wish to pursue college/technical education in private colleges and universities.\nThe answer: Private Education Student Financial Assistance", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer involves identifying a law that recognizes two types of schools in South Africa. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so the fact that some of the oldest schools were established by missionaries in the early nineteenth century is irrelevant. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that some of the schools were established by missionaries is also irrelevant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the South African Schools Act of 1996 as the law that recognized two types of schools. \nThe answer: The South African Schools Act of 1996.", "{1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year in which the South African Schools Act was passed. Rule 1 tells us that we need to pay attention to comparative language, but there is none in this passage. Rule 16 tells us that we should pay attention to the order of events, but there is no order given in this passage. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important, but there are no negations in this passage. Therefore, we can use the default rule that names and dates are important. \nThe answer: 1996", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The South African Schools Act recognizes \"independent\" schools, which includes traditional private schools and schools which are privately governed. This is in addition to \"public\" schools, which are state-controlled. The relevant rules are 3 (distinguishing between different concepts), 4 (distinguishing between profession and nationality), and 16 (ordering of items in a list). \nThe answer: Independent schools", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private schools and schools which are privately governed are classified as independent.\nThe answer: traditional private schools and schools which are privately governed", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the oldest schools in South Africa were established by missionaries in the early nineteenth century. \nThe answer: early nineteenth century", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size and shape are not relevant to the answer. Profession is relevant because it distinguishes between different types of schools. Negations are important because the question asks for a specific type of school. \nThe answer: government schools formerly reserved for white children.", "{2, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Former Model C schools tend to produce better academic results than government schools formerly reserved for other race groups.\nThe answer: better", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the fact that former Model C schools tend to set much higher school fees than other public schools implies that the fees at other schools are lower than those at former Model C schools.\nThe answer: Fees at other schools tend to be lower than those at former Model C schools.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the percentage of students attending private schools and the percentage of students attending municipal schools. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that private schools and municipal schools are different concepts. \nThe answer: Over 10%", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: nearly 10,000 pupils", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 700 employees", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the English translation of a specific name. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant. \nThe answer: The Knowledge School", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Therefore, \"school model\" can be considered a synonym for \"school voucher model.\" The rule that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: school voucher model", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public schools.\nThe answer: 13 years old", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public schools. \"Public schools\" in the UK are actually fee-paying independent schools. Therefore, the answer is independent schools.", "{7, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the percentage of British children educated at GSCE level in fee-paying schools. The passage states that approximately 9% of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level. Therefore, the answer is 9%.", "{3, 8, 12, 16}\nExplanation: We need to find the percentage of British students attending fee-paying schools at A-level. The passage states that approximately 13% of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at A-level. Therefore, the answer is 13%. \nThe answer: 13%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that independent schools in the UK charge fees ranging from under \u00a33,000 to \u00a321,000 and above per year for day pupils. It does not mention any specific fees for public schools. However, public schools are mentioned as preparatory schools for pupils up to 13 years old, and the name \"public school\" is explained as being open to pupils from anywhere. Therefore, it can be inferred that public schools in the UK are fee-paying schools. Since the question asks for the upper range of fees for non-boarding students in British public schools, it can be assumed that the fees for boarders are higher. Therefore, the answer is: \u00a321,000. \nThe answer: \u00a321,000", "{1, 7, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between desegregation and the creation of private Christian academies. Rule 7 is relevant because the question contains a synonym for \"desegregate\". Rule 10 is relevant because it states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 is relevant because it allows us to ignore the irrelevant information about the academic content of the academies. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a derogatory term for the Christian academies that arose in the wake of school desegregation. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be related to any of those. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"derogatory\" in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we should pay attention to any negative language in the passage. The answer: \"segregation academies\".", "{1, 2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about the location where students migrated to Christian academies during the desegregation period. Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they establish the relationship between the public schools and the private Christian academies. Rule 7 is relevant because the question asks about the location, which is a synonym for \"part of the United States.\" Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"did not migrate\"), which is important for understanding the answer. \nThe answer: The U.S. South", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be \"white\" or any other physical characteristic. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if white students migrated to Christian academies, then the primary race of students attending public schools became African-American. \nThe answer: African-American", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rules state that ethnicity is a different concept from profession and nationality, and that negations are important for the answer. The passage states that after school desegregation, public schools became more heavily concentrated with African-American students. \nThe answer: African-American students", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private schools are funded through student tuition, endowments, scholarship/voucher funds, donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals. Government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden, according to the courts' interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments. Non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle, preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status.\nThe answer: religious organizations or private individuals", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about the amendment that governs government funding of religious schools, which implies that there are restrictions or prohibitions on such funding. Rule 3 states that concepts such as religion and government are different, so we can infer that the amendment in question is related to the separation of church and state. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any rules related to professions. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the amendment that governs funding of religious schools, not the one that allows it. \nThe answer: The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"religion\" is a different concept from \"state\" (rule 3) and the rule that \"government\" is a different concept from \"religion\" (rule 4) are relevant because the question asks about state constitutional amendments and their impact on government funding for religious schools. The rule that negations are important for the answer (rule 17) is also relevant because the question asks specifically about state amendments that restrict or forbid government funding for religious schools. \nThe answer: state Blaine Amendments", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Private non-religious schools could receive public funds if they had charter status.\nThe answer: charter status", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that compulsory education began in Massachusetts in 1852, which means that Massachusetts was the first US state to have compulsory education.\nThe answer: Massachusetts", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that compulsory education began in Massachusetts in 1852.\nThe answer: 1852", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1972", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we need to identify the name of the case and its citation.\nThe answer: 268 U.S. 510", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: McCrary", "{rule list: 3, 10}\nExplanation: Tuition for quality private schools in the US was close to $40,000 annually for day schools in New York City as of 2012. Typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: close to $40,000 annually", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: The article states that \"quality private schools in the United States charged substantial tuition, close to $40,000 annually for day schools in New York City, and nearly $50,000 for boarding schools.\" This means that a parent would have to pay nearly $50,000 to send their child to a boarding school in 2012.\nThe answer: nearly $50,000", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the size of the school's endowment is not related to its name or location. However, the article mentions that \"the leading schools such as the Groton School had substantial endowments running to hundreds of millions of dollars supplemented by fundraising drives,\" indicating that Groton School is a notable private school with a large endowment.\nThe answer: Groton School", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that tuition does not cover operating expenses, particularly at boarding schools. Therefore, the answer must be something other than tuition. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Since tuition does not cover operating expenses, the answer must be something that covers operating expenses. Therefore, the answer is fundraising drives. \nThe answer: Fundraising drives.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: John Harvard", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" and the rule 22 states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\". In the last sentence of the passage, it is mentioned that \"The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.\" Therefore, the answer is 1977.", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that the leader through the Great Depression and World War II came after President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure. Then, we use rule 23 to determine that the leader is the subject of the sentence and acted upon the verb \"led\". \nThe answer: James Bryant Conant", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Association of American Universities", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage states that President Charles W. Eliot transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university. \nThe answer: Charles W.

First comes before last. \nThe answer: over 18 million volumes.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the individuals are US presidents is not relevant to their alumni status. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so we can assume that the list of individuals is in chronological order. \nThe answer: eight", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"some 150 Nobel laureates\" have been affiliated with Harvard as students, faculty, or staff, indicating that the number is greater than zero but not specifying an exact number. The use of \"some\" implies that the number is not precise, but rather an approximation.\nThe answer: some 150", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the university has campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area and that its main campus is located in Cambridge, which is approximately 3 miles northwest of Boston.\nThe answer: Boston", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: Size and location are irrelevant to the answer, so rule 3 and 12 apply.\nThe answer: $37.6 billion", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the business school and athletics facilities are located \"across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston.\" This indicates that the Charles River is located in the vicinity of the school.\nThe answer: Charles River", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the University is organized into eleven separate academic units, which are ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. \nThe answer: Eleven", "{rule list: locations are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the area where the main campus of Harvard is located, which is Cambridge.\nThe answer: Cambridge", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The formation of the school is a past event, so we need to determine the year it happened. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the year will come before any other events mentioned in the passage. Rule 23 tells us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"Harvard was formed in 1636\" is in the passive voice, so we know that \"Harvard\" is the subject and \"formed\" is the verb. \nThe answer: 1636", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Harvard was formed in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony\" is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject (Harvard) was acted upon by the organization that voted to form it (the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony). Therefore, we can use rule 23 to determine that the organization arranged the founding of the school.\nThe answer: the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1638", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In 1639, the college was renamed Harvard College\" which directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 1639.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the sentence \"The charter creating the Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650\" is referring to the most recent event mentioned in the passage. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence is in the passive voice, with \"the charter\" being the subject and \"granted\" being the verb. \nThe answer: 1650", "{rule list: 1, 4, 13, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question asks about the faith of the ministers trained by the university. Rules 1 and 4 are relevant because they establish that religion and denomination are different concepts, and that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 13 is relevant because it establishes that names are important for the answer. Rules 19, 20, and 21 are relevant because they establish that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, and that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, as well as \"his\" and \"her\" respectively. \nThe answer: Puritan", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that the College offered a classic curriculum on the English university model, but conformed to Puritanism. It was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches.\nThe answer: English university model", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that the school was \"never affiliated with any particular denomination.\" \nThe answer: No, the school was not officially associated with any denomination.", "{16, 22}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that \"Harvard President Joseph Willard\" is a person and that \"died\" refers to his death. We use rule 22 to determine that \"a year later\" refers to the year after David Tappan's death in 1803. \nThe answer: 1804", "{1, 3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the successor of Joseph Willard as president, which implies that Joseph Willard was the previous president. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Joseph Willard was the previous president and the successor came after him. The passage also mentions that Samuel Webber was appointed as the president of Harvard two years after Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805. Rule 1 states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, so we can infer that Samuel Webber succeeded Joseph Willard as president. Rule 3 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about their nationality. \nThe answer: Samuel Webber", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Henry Ware was elected to the chair in 1805.\nThe answer: 1805", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Louis Agassiz's natural history lectures were acclaimed in New York and on the campus at Harvard College in 1846.\nThe answer: Louis Agassiz", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Agassiz's approach to science combined observation with intuition.\nThe answer: intuition", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that shape is a different concept from knowledge eliminates the possibility of confusion between the two concepts. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first helps identify the Scottish philosophers as Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, who are mentioned last in the sentence. The rule that negations are important for the answer helps identify that Agassiz did not reject Common Sense Realism, but rather incorporated it into his dual view of knowledge. \nThe answer: Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the president's name is relevant to the answer, but their nationality is not. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we need to identify the name of the president. \nThe answer: Charles W. Eliot", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person who led the school back to being a leading research institution. Rule 1 tells us that \"leading\" is a comparative concept, so we need to look for a comparison. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the person's nationality. Rule 16 tells us that \"lead\" refers to being in a position of authority, so we need to look for someone who held a leadership position. The answer: James Bryant Conant. \n\nThe answer: James Bryant Conant.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: James Bryant Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth.\nThe answer: by devising programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the year in which Harvard released an important document about education in America. The passage mentions that in 1943, James Bryant Conant asked the faculty to make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, and the resulting Report was published in 1945. Therefore, the answer is 1945.\nThe answer: 1945", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe.\" This means that the ratio of men to women at Harvard/Radcliffe was 4:1.\nThe answer: 4:1", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977, the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased.\" This indicates that the merger occurred in 1977.\nThe answer: 1977", "{2, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because the passage compares the male and female population at Harvard and Radcliffe. The rule 3 applies because the passage talks about the segregation of women at Radcliffe. The rule 8 applies because the passage talks about the increase in the proportion of female undergraduates. The rule 17 applies because the question asks about the trend of the female student population. \nThe answer: The proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Harvard Yard is about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of the State House in downtown Boston.\nThe answer: 3 miles", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses, nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River, and the other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle. \nThe answer: 12", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that nine of the twelve residential Houses are located \"south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River.\"\nThe answer: Charles River", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Quad is located \"half a mile northwest of the Yard.\" This indicates a distance from the Yard. Rule 3 states that size and distance are different concepts, and rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which helps to clarify that the Quad is located northwest of the Yard. \nThe answer: Half a mile.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Harvard Stadium is located on a 358-acre campus opposite the Cambridge campus in Allston. \nThe answer: Allston", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River that connects both campuses, so we need to identify the name of this bridge. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the name of the bridge will come after the mention of the campuses. Rule 23 reminds us that passive voice can be used, so we need to be aware of both active and passive constructions. \nThe answer: John W. Weeks Bridge", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a 21-acre campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area approximately 3.3 miles southwest of downtown Boston and 3.3 miles south of the Cambridge campus. \nThe answer: Longwood Medical and Academic Area", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Harvard now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge.\nThe answer: approximately fifty percent more", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: The rules of size and shape are not relevant to this question. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps us understand that if there are proposals to connect the Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus, then there must be some distance between them. Rule 3 is relevant because it helps us understand that the proposals may involve different modes of transportation, such as bridges, shuttles, and trams. Rule 7 is relevant because the question asks for \"proposals to connect campuses,\" which is a synonym for \"plans to link the Cambridge and Allston campuses.\" \nThe answer: new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rules selected are those that help to identify the benefits to the surrounding community. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts such as park space and transit infrastructure are different from the concept of buildings. Rule 4 reminds us that the institution and the surrounding community are different concepts. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms, so \"additional benefits\" can be understood as \"benefits to the surrounding community.\" Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to look for positive statements about benefits. \nThe answer: enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible.", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage explicitly states that \"Harvard's 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors instruct 7,200 undergraduates and 14,000 graduate students.\" This information is directly relevant to the question and no other rules are needed to answer it.\nThe answer: 2,400", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Harvard has 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors who instruct 7,200 undergraduates and 14,000 graduate students. \nThe answer: 7,200", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to extract the number of graduate students at Harvard.\nThe answer: 14,000", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The color crimson was unofficially adopted in 1875.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858.\nThe answer: 1858", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article provides specific information about the value of Harvard's endowment in different years, and how it was affected by the 2008 recession. Rule 2 applies because the article mentions different values for the endowment, and we need to determine which one is the highest. Rule 8 applies because we need to understand that if the endowment increased from one year to another, then the previous year's value is less than the current year's value. \nThe answer: $32 billion", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Harvard's endowment suffered about a 30% loss in 2008-09, and later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Therefore, the answer is that the losses suffered in the financial crisis of 2008-09 to Harvard endowment were nearly 50%.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Harvard halted construction of the Allston Science Complex due to budget cuts caused by the financial crisis. The rules used are 3 (distinguishing between concepts), 8 (antonyms), and 17 (negations). \nThe answer: construction of the Allston Science Complex", "{4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The relevant rules are that names and locations are equally important for the answer, irrelevant information in the context should be ignored, and negations are important for the answer.

Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we know that the movement was not a time period other than the late 1980s. \nThe answer: late 1980s", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Duke Kent-Brown.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Harvard reduced its South African holdings by $230 million out of $400 million in response to pressure. The use of the word \"reduce\" implies a comparison between the original amount and the new amount, which is a form of \"less than\" relationship. Therefore, rule 3 applies. Additionally, the question asks for the amount of reduction, which is a form of \"difference\" relationship. Therefore, rule 8 also applies.\nThe answer: $230 million", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Harvard College accepted 5.3% of applicants for the class of 2019, which means that the acceptance rate is very low. Therefore, we can apply rule 2 to infer that Harvard College is the most selective among all national universities. We can also apply rule 8 to infer that other universities have higher admission rates than Harvard College.\nThe answer: 5.3%", "{16, 18}\nExplanation: The passage states that Harvard ended its early admissions program in 2007. \nThe answer: 2007", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any information about one does not necessarily apply to the other. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The passage states that Harvard ended its early admissions program because it was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants, so the answer is that Harvard ended its early admission program to avoid disadvantaging these groups.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: for the class of 2016", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that between 1978 and 2008, entering students were required to complete a core curriculum of seven classes outside of their concentration. This means that during that time period, four-year full-time undergraduate students were required to complete seven classes outside of their concentration.\nThe answer: seven", "{3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage that states \"Since 2008, undergraduate students have been required to complete courses in eight General Education categories\". This means that post 2008 undergraduate students are required to complete courses in eight general education categories.\nThe answer: eight", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the mention of Harvard's doctoral graduate program and its reliance on teaching fellows are irrelevant to the answer. The passage states that \"The New York Times, and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education; they consider this to adversely affect the quality of education.\" This is a criticism of Harvard's reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education, which is a negative impact on the quality of education.\nThe answer: Harvard's reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education adversely affects the quality of education.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Harvard's academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May.\" This sentence provides the start and end dates of the academic year.\nThe answer: early September to mid-May", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the number of courses taken and full-time status. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the concept of \"full-time status\" is different from the concept of \"number of courses taken.\" \nThe answer: four", "{1, 2, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the opposite of \"the next 30% of the class.\" Rule 2 applies because the question asks for the specific honor given to the top 4-5% of students. Rule 16 applies because the question asks about graduating students. \nThe answer: degrees summa cum laude", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that Latin honors are different from other types of honors mentioned in the passage. We use rule 16 to determine that 2004 comes before 2005. \nThe answer: 60%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer should only include the cost of tuition. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if families with incomes below $60,000 pay nothing, then families with higher incomes pay more. \nThe answer: $38,000", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: $57,000", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"age, shape, size, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" and rule 8 that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant. The question asks for the amount that students from families earning less than $60,000 pay for school after 2007. The passage states that \"families with incomes below $60,000 pay nothing for their children to attend, including room and board.\" Therefore, the answer is \"nothing\".", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 2009, Harvard offered grants totaling $414 million across all eleven divisions. \nThe answer: $414 million", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" are irrelevant to this question. The relevant rule is that \"profession and nationality are different concepts.\" The answer is 88%. \nThe answer: 88%", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The center library in the Harvard library system is Widener Library in Harvard Yard.\nThe answer: Widener Library", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Cabot Science Library, Lamont Library, and Widener Library are three of the most popular libraries for undergraduates to use. \nThe answer: Cabot Science Library, Lamont Library, and Widener Library.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The location of America's oldest collection of maps, gazettes, and atlases is mentioned in the passage as being stored in Pusey Library, which is part of the Harvard University Library System.\nThe answer: Pusey Library", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that size is a different concept from profession and nationality. We use rule 16 to determine that the total number of volumes is mentioned last in the passage.\nThe answer: over 18 million volumes.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Harvard Art Museums comprises three museums: the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, and the Fogg Museum of Art.\nThe answer: 3", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Fogg Museum of Art covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art.\nThe answer: Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage lists several museums at Harvard, and the question asks specifically about the one that specializes in cultural history and civilizations of the Western Hemisphere. The answer is the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.\nThe answer: Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: since 2003", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The second rule applies because \"topped\" is synonymous with \"was first in\". The sixteenth rule applies because \"since 2011\" indicates that the year mentioned comes after 2010. \nThe answer: 2011", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the ranking of Harvard as a \"dream college\" in 2013 according to The Princeton Review. The answer can be found in the passage which states that Harvard was the second most commonly named \"dream college\" for both students and parents in 2013. The negation in the question (\"where has Harvard ranked\") and the use of the past tense (\"ranked\") are important to note.\nThe answer: second", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Harvard competes in 42 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League. \nThe answer: 42", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University. According to rule 1, if A is more intense than B, then B is less intense than A. According to rule 16, \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so Harvard's most intense rival is Yale University.\nThe answer: Yale University", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Harvard-Yale rivalry is put aside \"every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team.\" This implies that the rivalry is set aside during the track and field competition.\nThe answer: During the Harvard and Yale Track and Field competition against Oxford and Cambridge.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that the annual football meeting between Harvard and Yale dates back to 1875.\nThe answer: 1875", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Harvard Stadium introduced the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country, implying that it was the first one. Additionally, the passage mentions that this happened in 1903. \nThe answer: 1903", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the year when a set of significant rule changes was introduced, specifically including the legalization of the forward pass. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the phrase \"significant rule changes\" which implies that there may have been other rule changes that were not as significant. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a specific year, which implies that there may have been other years when rule changes were introduced. \nThe answer: 1906", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Walter Camp's affiliation with Yale is mentioned in the passage, indicating that he was a captain for the Yale football team.\nThe answer: Yale", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions several athletic facilities at Harvard, but only one is specifically identified as the home of the basketball teams: the Lavietes Pavilion.\nThe answer: Lavietes Pavilion", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The rules eliminate any irrelevant information about the article and focus on identifying the name of Harvard's primary recreational sports facility. Rule 3 eliminates any information about specific athletic facilities that are not the primary one. Rule 4 eliminates any information about specific varsity sports teams. Rule 5 eliminates any information about the location of the athletic facilities. Rule 6 eliminates any information about specific coaches' offices. Rule 12 allows us to ignore any irrelevant information about the MAC's features. Rule 16 helps us identify that the MAC is the primary recreational sports facility. \nThe answer: Malkin Athletic Center (MAC)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size and number are different concepts, and the passage explicitly states that there are \"three weight rooms\" in the Malkin Athletic Center.\nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Harvard-Yale Regatta is older than The Game by 23 years.\nThe answer: 23 years", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Harvard-Yale Regatta is held annually in June on the Thames River in eastern Connecticut.\nThe answer: Thames River", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks about the primary rival of the Harvard Crimson hockey team. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the Harvard Crimson is a hockey team is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"Harvard\" comes before \"hockey team\" in terms of importance for the answer. The answer: Cornell.", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year in which Harvard won an Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championship. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from other attributes, so we can ignore the mention of the Harvard-Yale Regatta being older than The Game. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about Harvard's success in other sports. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the year in which Harvard won, not just participated in, an Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championship. \nThe answer: 2003.", "{4, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts eliminates any irrelevant information about political leaders from other countries. The rule that names are equally important for the answer allows us to focus on the specific name mentioned in the passage, Ban Ki-moon. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first helps us identify Ban Ki-moon as the first name mentioned in the list of political leaders. \nThe answer: Ban Ki-moon", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 4 to determine that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the list of political leaders from various countries. We use rule 16 to determine that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can search for the name of a Colombian president. The answer: There is no information in the article about a Colombian president who went to Harvard.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 4 to identify that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the other political leaders listed. We use rule 16 to determine that the first name comes before the last name. The answer is Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres.", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific person's profession and nationality, which are different concepts (rule 4). The person in question is referred to as \"Prime Minister,\" which indicates a profession (rule 16). The question uses the word \"was,\" indicating that the person is a former prime minister (rule 16). The question uses the word \"Palestine,\" which is a location and therefore important for the answer (rule 16). The question uses the pronoun \"his,\" indicating that the person is male (rule 20), and the possessive pronoun \"was\" indicating that the person is no longer in the position (rule 21). The sentence structure of the question is passive, indicating that the subject is acted upon the verb (rule 23).\nThe answer: There is no information in the article about a Harvard Alumni who was the Palestine Prime Minister.", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20, 21, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a person who went to Harvard and has the profession of a TV host and writer. We can use rules 4 to separate profession and nationality, and rules 16, 20, and 21 to identify the person's gender. Finally, we can use rule 23 to identify the subject of the sentence. \nThe answer: Conan O'Brien", "{rule list: 4, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the other professions listed. The rules 20 and 21 state that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can assume that the conductor is male. Therefore, the answer is: Leonard Bernstein.", "{4, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the nationality of the person. The rules 19, 20, and 21 state that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, and we can use \"cellist\" to identify the profession of the person. Therefore, the answer is Yo Yo Ma. \nThe answer: Yo Yo Ma", "{rule list: 13, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a person's name and profession. Rules 13, 19, 20, and 21 are relevant because they state that names are important for the answer, a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, and pronouns should be used correctly. \nThe answer: W. E. B. Du Bois, civil rights leader.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the nationality of the mathematician. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the mathematician's name is Shing-Tung Yau.\nThe answer: Shing-Tung Yau", "{4, 13, 20}\nExplanation: We need to identify the legal scholars who are faculty members at Harvard. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the other scholars listed. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for specific names. Rule 20 tells us that \"his\" refers to male names and \"her\" refers to female names, so we can look for a male name. The answer: Alan Dershowitz and Lawrence Lessig.", "{rule list: profession and names}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and names are different concepts is relevant because it tells us that just because someone is a scholar of Shakespeare does not mean they are a Shakespeare scholar. The rule that names are equally important for the answer is also relevant because it tells us that we need to look for a specific name. \nThe answer: Stephen Greenblatt", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The article states that Jacksonville is the largest city by population in the U.S. state of Florida.\nThe answer: Jacksonville", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"with an estimated population of 853,382 in 2014, it is the most populous city proper in Florida and the Southeast, and the 12th most populous in the United States.\" However, the question specifically asks for the population as of 2010, which is given as \"1,345,596\" for the Jacksonville metropolitan area.\nThe answer: 1,345,596", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size and population are different concepts, and the question specifically asks about population ranking. The rule about first and last also applies, as the question asks for Jacksonville's ranking. \nThe answer: 12th most populous in the United States.", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that the county where Jacksonville resides is important for the answer. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" means that the size and population of Jacksonville are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Duval County", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the city government consolidated in 1968,\" which means that consolidation occurred in 1968 and caused Jacksonville to become part of Duval County.\nThe answer: 1968", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jacksonville is centered on the banks of the St. Johns River.\nThe answer: St. Johns River", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them is irrelevant to the answer. However, the distance between two locations is relevant and can be extracted from the passage. \nThe answer: 340 miles (550 km)", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the area was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline in 1564, making \"Fort Caroline\" the answer.\nThe answer: Fort Caroline", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people.\nThe answer: Timucua people", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jacksonville was named after Andrew Jackson, who was the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States.\nThe answer: Andrew Jackson", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the military forces are in Jacksonville does not give us any information about their ranking. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, but there is no first or last mentioned in the context. Therefore, we cannot determine the ranking of the military forces in Jacksonville.\nThe answer: cannot be determined.", "{rule list: 3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: Golf is mentioned as being particularly important to tourism in the Jacksonville area, making it the most likely answer to the question.\nThe answer: Golf", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions two US Navy bases in Jacksonville, Blount Island Command and Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. Therefore, the answer is 2.\nThe answer: 2", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a name or term used to refer to people from Jacksonville. Rule 3 states that names are different concepts from size, shape, age, and color, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can focus on the sentence that directly answers the question: \"People from Jacksonville may be called 'Jacksonvillians' or 'Jaxsons' (also spelled 'Jaxons').\" \nThe answer: Jacksonvillians or Jaxsons", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for how many years the area has been inhabited, which implies a comparison to other areas. Rule 3 applies because the answer refers to the concept of time. \nThe answer: thousands of years", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that a team from the University of North Florida discovered the pottery remnants on Black Hammock Island.\nThe answer: University of North Florida team", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the oldest remnants of pottery in the United States were discovered on Black Hammock Island, dating back to 2500 BC. However, it does not specify which civilization the pottery belonged to. Therefore, rule 3 (color, shape, age, and size are different concepts) and rule 13 (names are equally important for the answer) are not relevant. \nThe answer: The article does not provide the answer to the question.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In the 16th century, the beginning of the historical era\" the region was inhabited by the Mocama people. This indicates that the 16th century is known as the start of the historical era.\nThe answer: the historical era", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that one early map shows a village called Ossachite at the site of what is now downtown Jacksonville. This means that Ossachite is the name of the village that once existed in what is now downtown Jacksonville.\nThe answer: Ossachite", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Jean Ribault was the one who mapped the St. Johns River. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence \"the River of May was charted by French Huguenot explorer Jean Ribault in 1562\" is in passive voice and therefore not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Jean Ribault", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Jean Ribault claimed the newly discovered land for France, so the answer is France.\nThe answer: France", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Spanish renamed Fort Caroline to San Mateo after their attack. This answer is straightforward and does not require any additional rules beyond Rule 3 (clarifying that names are important for the answer) and Rule 16 (clarifying that first comes before last and last comes after first). \nThe answer: San Mateo", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Fort Caroline", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War.\" This is an example of a passive sentence, where the subject (Spain) is acted upon the verb (ceded). Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the event being referred to happened before 1763. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we know that Spain did not concede Florida to Britain, but rather was the one being conceded to. \nThe answer: the French and Indian War", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The English introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo, and fruits, as well as the export of lumber, which resulted in the northeastern Florida area prospering economically more than it had under the Spanish. They also constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia, which crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point called the Cow Ford or Cowford. \nThe answer: introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo, and fruits, as well as the export of lumber, and constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the Seminole called the narrow point Wacca Pilatka and the British called it Cow Ford or Cowford, reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The use of \"ostensibly\" suggests that there may be other reasons for the name, but the passage does not provide any further information. \nThe answer: The narrow point of St. John's River was called Cowford because cattle were brought across the river there.", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity that gained control of Florida after the Revolutionary War. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the answer should refer to the entity that came after the Revolutionary War. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, which means that we need to look for the opposite of the Revolutionary War in the context. The passage states that Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War. Therefore, Spain gained control of Florida after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War.\nThe answer: Spain", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that residents of the settlement at the Cow Ford planned a town and wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.\nThe answer: February 9, 1832", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking which side the supplies from Jacksonville were aiding in the Civil War. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and not interchangeable. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is the Confederate cause. \nThe answer: Confederate cause", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Skirmish of the Brick Church", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how Union forces left Jacksonville after the Battle of Olustee and then returned to and occupied the city for the remainder of the war. This indicates that the answer is the Battle of Olustee.\nThe answer: Battle of Olustee", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes how warfare and a long occupation left the city disrupted after the war. This implies that the negative impact on Jacksonville following the war was due to the disruption caused by the warfare and occupation.\nThe answer: warfare and occupation", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition resulting in the Battle of Cedar Creek.\" This means that the battle took place in March of 1864.\nThe answer: 1864", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, Jacksonville became a popular winter resort for the rich and famous. This means that it happened during that period of time. The rule that applies is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the period of time (A) is more specific than \"popular destination for the rich\" (B), so we can infer that Jacksonville became a popular destination for the rich during that period. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which helps us identify the specific period of time mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: Reconstruction and the Gilded Age", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"President Grover Cleveland attended the Sub-Tropical Exposition in the city on February 22, 1888 during his trip to Florida.\" This is a passive sentence, where the subject (President Grover Cleveland) is acted upon the verb (attended). Therefore, we need to apply rule 23 to determine that the answer is Grover Cleveland.\nThe answer: Grover Cleveland", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jacksonville's tourism was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks. This means that something negative happened to Jacksonville's tourism. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answers related to those concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that Jacksonville's tourism became less desirable in the latter half of the 19th century due to negative events such as yellow fever outbreaks. \nThe answer: yellow fever outbreaks", "{1, 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway further south made other areas more accessible and therefore more attractive to tourists. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about what drew tourists away from Jacksonville, which implies that there were other factors that made Jacksonville less attractive. Rule 12 applies because the passage mentions yellow fever outbreaks and the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"drew,\" which implies a negation. \nThe answer: extension of the Florida East Coast Railway further south", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad, indicating that the modern form of travel was the railroad.\nThe answer: railroad", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the fire started as a kitchen fire, but it quickly spread due to the Spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory being engulfed in flames. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the moss was flammable is not the same as the cause of the fire. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the cause of the fire's spread, so the answer should not be \"kitchen fire\" but rather the reason why the fire was able to spread so quickly. \nThe answer: Spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabling the fire to spread rapidly.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the fire \"destroyed over 2,000 buildings.\" \nThe answer: over 2,000 buildings", "{16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Governor Jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order.\" This indicates that the Florida Governor declared martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order in the wake of the Jacksonville fire.\nThe answer: declared martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name that the Jacksonville fire came to be known as, which is a matter of definition and therefore falls under rule 3. Additionally, the question uses the phrase \"later known as,\" which implies that the answer may be a name that was given to the fire after the fact, and therefore requires attention to negations, making rule 17 relevant. \nThe answer: The Great Fire of 1901", "{rule list: 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Filmmakers based in New York were drawn to Jacksonville in the 1910s.\nThe answer: New York-based filmmakers", "{3, 4, 5, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"categories are different concepts\" (rule 3) tells us that the type of movies produced is not related to the other details mentioned in the passage. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (rule 4) tells us that the location of the filmmakers is also not relevant. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" (rule 5) is not applicable. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" (rule 7) is relevant because \"type of movies\" can be synonymous with \"genre\". \nThe answer: The passage does not provide information about the specific type or genre of movies produced in Jacksonville's 30 studios.", "{3, 6, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, as are animals and vehicles. Names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: \"Winter Film Capital of the World\"", "{3, 5, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and animals are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Vehicles are also not relevant. The passage mentions that Hollywood emerged as a major film production center, which implies that it took over the industry from Jacksonville. Therefore, rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) applies. \nThe answer: the emergence of Hollywood as a major film production center", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs.\nThe answer: Construction of highways", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific demographic statistic, which is not related to any other concept in the article. Therefore, rules 3 and 16 are the most relevant. \nThe answer: 55.1%", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the term that refers to middle class citizens leaving the suburbs. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that \"white flight\" refers to white citizens leaving the suburbs. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" or any other negations in the question. There are no negations in this question, so we can ignore this rule. \nThe answer: white flight", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The mayor of Jacksonville, W. Haydon Burns, was responsible for the new public building projects.\nThe answer: W. Haydon Burns", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jacksonville suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after World War II, which caused residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs. The use of \"after\" in the question indicates a negation, so we apply rule 17 to consider the negation. The answer is World War II.\nThe answer: World War II", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Much of the city's tax base dissipated,\" which implies that the cause for the issues with city funding was a decrease in the amount of taxes collected. This is related to the concept of finances, which is different from professions and nationalities (rule 4) and animals and vehicles (rule 6). \nThe answer: a decrease in the tax base", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services. This means that the lack of city services was experienced by residents in the suburbs. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as location and services. Rule 12 is relevant because it allows us to ignore irrelevant information in the passage. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: suburbs", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The city of Jacksonville was facing issues with funding education, sanitation, and traffic control due to the dissipation of its tax base. A study recommended annexing outlying communities to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county. \nThe answer: Annexing outlying communities.", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it tells us that the voters referred to in the passage are located after the mention of the annexation plans. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is also relevant because the question asks for the group that voted against the annexation, implying that there were others who voted for it. \nThe answer: voters outside the city limits", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: through the traditional old boy network", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"After a grand jury was convened to investigate, 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign.\"\nThe answer: 11", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about a political group gaining support after corruption scandals among city officials. Rule 1 applies because it involves a comparison of the level of support before and after the scandal. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is important in identifying the political group. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"began to gain support\"), which is important in determining the answer. \nThe answer: Jacksonville Consolidation", "{1, 2, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that corruption scandals among city officials led to the indictment of 11 officials and forced others to resign. This added momentum to proposals for government reform, which gained support from both inner city blacks and whites in the suburbs. Therefore, the answer is the corruption scandals among city officials.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Voters approved the consolidation plan.", "{16, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"then-Mayor Hans Tanzler posed with actress Lee Meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the 'Bold New City of the South' at Florida 13 and Julington Creek\" in honor of the occasion of the consolidation. Therefore, the answer is Hans Tanzler. \nThe answer: Hans Tanzler", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that on October 1, 1968, the governments merged to create the Consolidated City of Jacksonville, and in honor of the occasion, then-Mayor Hans Tanzler posed with actress Lee Meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the \"Bold New City of the South\" at Florida 13 and Julington Creek.\nThe answer: Bold New City of the South", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is a specific name of a measure that was approved by Jacksonville voters. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as \"fire,\" \"police,\" and \"public works\" are different and should not be confused with the name of the measure. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about the consolidation referendum and the creation of the Consolidated City of Jacksonville. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the name of the approved measure, not the source of the revenue. \n\nThe answer: Better Jacksonville Plan", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We can ignore the irrelevant information about the consolidation referendum and the photo op with the mayor and actress. The relevant information is that the Better Jacksonville Plan authorized a half-penny sales tax, which generated most of the revenue for the major projects. The negation in the question (\"how did\") is important for understanding that the answer is about the method of generating money. \nThe answer: through a half-penny sales tax", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Jacksonville has a total area of 874.3 square miles, of which 86.66% is land. Therefore, the land area of Jacksonville is 757.7 square miles.\nThe answer: 757.7 square miles", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The St. Johns River divides the city.\" \nThe answer: St. Johns River", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the city's area. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that the Trout River is the river mentioned last in the passage.\nThe answer: Trout River", "{3}\nExplanation: The article states that 13.34% of Jacksonville is water.\nThe answer: 13.34%", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Jacksonville surrounds the town of Baldwin.\" This means that Baldwin is located within the boundaries of Jacksonville.\nThe answer: Baldwin", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Bank of America Tower is the tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville's skyline.\nThe answer: tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville's skyline", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" tells us that the name of the building is important. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" tells us that the previous name came before \"Bank of America Tower.\" \nThe answer: Barnett Center", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the height of the Bank of America Tower is a different concept from the height of other buildings mentioned in the article. We use rule 8 to infer that the height of the Bank of America Tower is more than the height of any other building mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: 617 ft (188 m)", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article mentions three buildings: Bank of America Tower, Wells Fargo Center, and Riverplace Tower. The information about the number of floors in the building completed in 1967 refers to Riverplace Tower, which is the last building mentioned. Therefore, we can use the rule to determine that the number of floors in Riverplace Tower is the answer.\nThe answer: 28", "{rule list: size, shape, age, location}\nExplanation: The Wells Fargo Center is notable for its distinctive flared base, which makes it the defining building in the Jacksonville skyline. This is a characteristic of its shape.\nThe answer: Its distinctive flared base.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant here. The question asks for the type of climate in Jacksonville, and the passage describes it as having a humid subtropical climate with mild winters and hot, humid summers. Therefore, the answer is \"humid subtropical.\"", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for when rain typically falls, which implies a comparison between different times of the year. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific aspect of the climate, which is rainfall. Rule 7 applies because the question contains the synonym \"typically.\" \nThe answer: Seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months from May through September.", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article compares winter weather to summer weather. Rule 2 applies because the article describes winter weather as mild, while summer weather is described as hot and humid. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the description of winter weather.\nThe answer: mild", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a factor that contributes to Jacksonville's lack of cold weather. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so options related to the size or shape of Jacksonville are irrelevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What contributes to Jacksonville's warm weather?\" The answer is \"low latitude.\" \nThe answer: low latitude", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the highest temperature recorded in Jacksonville was 104 \u00b0F (40 \u00b0C) on July 11, 1879 and July 28, 1872. Therefore, the answer is 104 \u00b0F. \nThe answer: 104 \u00b0F", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"It is common for thunderstorms to erupt during a typical summer afternoon.\" This indicates that thunderstorms are a common occurrence during summer days.\nThe answer: thunderstorms", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that thunderstorms in Jacksonville are caused by the rapid heating of the land relative to the water, combined with extremely high humidity. This implies that water contributes to the formation of these storms. Therefore, the answer is water/humidity. \nThe answer: humidity", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the hottest month, which implies a comparison of temperatures between different months. Rule 3 applies because temperature is a different concept from other factors mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: July", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be based on the size or strength of the storm. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Which storm had the least significant impact on Jacksonville?\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that Hurricane Dora in 1964 had the most significant impact on Jacksonville. \nThe answer: Hurricane Dora in 1964.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Hurricane Dora in 1964 had sustained winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h) when it crossed St. Augustine. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the winds were \"strong\" is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"How slow were the winds around St. Augustine in the 1964 hurricane?\" \nThe answer: 110 mph (180 km/h)", "{rule list: 3, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the storm that hit Jacksonville in May of 2012. The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm Beryl on May 28, 2012. Rule 3 reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 reminds us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Tropical Storm Beryl", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion between the scale of hurricanes and other types of scales. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to infer that the scale used to measure the strength of hurricanes is called the Saffir-Simpson Scale. \nThe answer: Saffir-Simpson Scale", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about several hurricanes and tropical storms that have affected Jacksonville, but only one of them caused a four day loss of power. Rule 3 indicates that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the hurricanes. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify the most recent storm that caused a four day loss of power. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for a loss of power, not just a tropical storm. \nThe answer: 2008", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"ethnicity is a different concept from location\" (rule 3) is relevant because the question is asking about an ethnic group. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" (rule 7) is relevant because the question uses the phrase \"ranked tenth largest\" instead of \"has the country's tenth-largest population.\" The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" (rule 13) is relevant because the question is asking about a specific ethnic group. \nThe answer: Arab population", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 and 22. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the first number mentioned in the passage is likely the answer. Rule 22 states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last,\" which means that if there are multiple numbers mentioned, the first one is likely the answer. The answer is 821,784.\nThe answer: 821,784", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, we cannot compare the size or number of the Filipino population in Jacksonville to the rest of Florida. The answer is that the passage does not provide information on how Jacksonville's Filipino population ranks compared to the rest of Florida.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Filipino community", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that 29.7% of all households were made up of individuals, so that is the portion of households in Jacksonville that have only one person.\nThe answer: 29.7%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that 23.9% of the population is under the age of 18. \nThe answer: 23.9%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Gender is not mentioned in the passage until the end, where it is stated that there were 94.1 males for every 100 females. Therefore, males are more populous across all groups in Jacksonville.\nThe answer: males", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires comparing the number of males to females over the age of 18, so we need to use rule 3 to distinguish between age and gender. We also need to use rule 16 to determine that the number of males comes after the number of females. \nThe answer: 91.3", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the percentage of assets owned by the richest 1%, which implies a comparison to the assets owned by others. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the percentage owned by the richest 1%, which is the opposite of the antonym of \"owned by the richest 1%\". \nThe answer: 40%", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of average people that have wealth equal to the 85 richest people, so we need to focus on the comparison between these two groups. Rule 3 tells us that size and quantity are different concepts, so we cannot compare the number of people directly to the amount of wealth. Rule 8 tells us that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"How many people have wealth equal to the 85 richest individuals?\" Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the \"bottom\" 50% of the world's population. \nThe answer: 3.5 billion people.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the amount of money needed to be in the top percentile, which implies a comparison between different levels of wealth. Rule 3 states that size and amount are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the answer will be expressed in terms of a specific currency or unit of measurement. Rule 8 states that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A, and A has less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can apply this rule to infer that the top percentile refers to the wealthiest individuals, and therefore, the answer will be expressed in terms of the amount of money they possess. \nThe answer: $759,900", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the methodology used, specifically the use of net wealth and the inclusion of debts", "{7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question contains the word \"doubted,\" which is a negation. Therefore, rules 7 and 8 apply, which state that negations in the question are important for the answer and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Additionally, rule 17 applies, which states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Oxfam and Credit Suisse believe their findings are being doubted due to criticism about the methodology used, specifically regarding the inclusion of debts in the calculation of net wealth.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" is relevant because the article states that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. Therefore, the answer is 40%. \nThe answer: 40%", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"more\" implies a comparison, and according to rule 1, if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Rule 2 applies because \"more financial assets\" implies a comparison, and according to rule 2, if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. Rule 3 applies because \"possess\" refers to ownership, which is a concept of possession. \nThe answer: Financial assets", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific amount of wealth, which is a numerical concept. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from color, shape, age, and profession, so it is relevant to the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the 10 million dollar millionaires had a large amount of wealth, then the bottom half of the population had a small amount of wealth.\nThe answer: nearly $41 trillion", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific percentage of global wealth owned by the wealthiest 1 percent, which is a comparison between two groups. Rule 1 applies because it establishes that if A has more X than B, then B has less X than A. Rule 8 applies because it states that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A, and A has less antonym(X) than B.\nThe answer: more than half", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the reason why there are more poor people in the United States and Europe than in China. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so these factors cannot be the reason. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the reason must be that there is less wealth in the United States and Europe than in China. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer is that there are not more poor people in the United States and Europe than in China. \nThe answer: There are not more poor people in the United States and Europe than in China.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the top 400 richest Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. This means that more than half of all citizens are poorer than the top 400 richest Americans.\nThe answer: more than half", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: New York Times", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage suggests that inherited wealth may give some Americans a \"substantial head start\" in becoming rich.\nThe answer: inherited wealth", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that \"inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a 'substantial head start'\" and that \"over 60 percent\" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans \"grew up in substantial privilege.\" This implies that the richest 400 Americans had inherited wealth and grew up in privileged backgrounds that helped them be successful adults.\nThe answer: inherited wealth and privileged backgrounds", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a comparison of wealth between two groups. Rule 3 applies because wealth and number of people are different concepts. \nThe answer: wealth", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24}\nExplanation: The article states that the \"richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent\". \nThe answer: The richest 1 percent in the United States.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: inherited wealth", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: over 60 percent", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Institute for Policy Studies", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: This question is asking about a philosophy of thought related to wealth inequality. Rules 3 and 4 are relevant because they establish that concepts such as \"inequality\" and \"productivity gap\" are distinct from concepts such as \"size\" and \"profession/nationality.\" Rule 8 is also relevant because it establishes that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is applicable to the relationship between highly-paid and lower-paid professions. \nThe answer: Neoclassical economics", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Neoclassical economics attributes income inequality to differences in value added by labor, capital, and land, and within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers. This is a comparison between professions and their productivity, which falls under rule 1. Additionally, the concept of income is related to profession, which falls under rule 4.\nThe answer: differences in value added by labor, capital, and land", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4), \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" (3), and \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" (8). The answer to the question is that the distribution of income is impacted by the value added by different classifications of workers, such as highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the term that describes the difference between higher and lower paid professionals, which implies a comparison. Rule 3 applies because the question distinguishes between the concepts of \"profession\" and \"income.\" \nThe answer: productivity gap", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The first rule applies because the passage discusses differences in value added by labor, capital, and land, and how this affects income distribution. The fourth rule applies because the passage distinguishes between different classifications of workers (e.g. highly-paid professions vs. lower-paid professions) and how this affects wages and profits. \nThe answer: Income is determined by the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital, and land. Therefore, the answer is \"differences in value added by labor, capital, and land.\"\nThe answer: Differences in value added by labor, capital, and land.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"inequalities in the distribution of income\" are due to \"differences in value added by labor, capital and land.\" It then goes on to explain that within the labor income distribution, differences are due to \"value added by different classifications of workers.\" Therefore, the answer is \"differences in value added by different classifications of workers.\" \nThe answer: different classifications of workers", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the sentence compares the marginal value added of different economic actors. Rule 3 applies because the concept of marginal value added is different from the concepts of size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: wages and profits", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage mentions three economic actors: workers, capitalists/business owners, and landlords.\nThe answer: workers, capitalists/business owners, landlords", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the sentence states that \"inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap\", which can be rephrased as \"the productivity gap causes inequality\". Rule 4 applies because the sentence mentions \"highly-paid professions\" and \"lower-paid professions\", which are different classifications of workers. \nThe answer: the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits is a comparison between capital equipment and labor inputs. Rule 2 applies because the trend of substituting capital equipment for labor inputs results in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what pushes businesses to increase pressures on workers, implying a negation. \nThe answer: competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the substitution of capital equipment for labor, which raises the productivity of each worker. Therefore, working harder has a positive impact on productivity.\nThe answer: It raises productivity.", "1, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that as capitalist firms substitute capital equipment for labor inputs, less workers are required, which implies that the job market is negatively affected. Rule 8 applies because the question asks what happens to the job market when less workers are required, which implies that the answer should include the antonym of \"required,\" which is \"unemployed.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a negative outcome, so the answer should reflect that by including the negation. \nThe answer: unemployment increases", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Higher worker productivity and leveled pay result in rising levels of property income for the capitalist class. (Note: The question does not mention anything about higher earners, so this answer assumes that \"higher earners\" refers to the capitalist class mentioned in the passage.) \nThe answer: Rising levels of property income.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found using the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A.\" The article states that capitalist firms substitute capital equipment for labor inputs (workers). Therefore, the answer is labor inputs or workers. \nThe answer: labor inputs or workers.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Firms substitute equipment for workers to reduce costs and maximize profits, which is a result of competitive pressure in the capitalist system. This applies rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts.\nThe answer: to reduce costs and maximize profits", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The trend of capitalist firms substituting capital equipment for labor inputs increases the organic composition of capital over the long term. This is because less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, leading to increased unemployment and a downward pressure on wages. \nThe answer: Substitution of capital equipment for labor inputs", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: productivity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" apply here. Mechanization and automation lead to relatively stagnant wages for the working class. Therefore, the antonym of \"stagnant\" is \"increasing,\" which means that mechanization and automation do not lead to increasing wages for the working class. \nThe answer: relatively stagnant wages", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Wages are controlled by the market in a purely capitalist mode of production, as they work in the same way as prices for any other good. The market price of skill determines wages, which drives inequality.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the value of a worker, or their wages, is determined by the market price of their skill, which is in turn determined by the law of supply and demand. This means that the price of skill is a function of the demand for and supply of skilled workers. \nThe answer: the law of supply and demand", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: If a business underpays their workers, they will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage to attract the best of their labor. Therefore, it is a losing proposition for a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest to offer below market wages to workers.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in a purely capitalist mode of production, wages are determined by the market price of skill, which is a function of supply and demand. Employers who offer below market wages will find their business understaffed, and their competitors will take advantage by offering higher wages to attract the best labor. This is an example of how the law of supply and demand works in the labor market. \nThe answer: By offering higher wages than their competitors.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant either. However, the rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks about how workers generally view income inequality, which implies that there may be some workers who do not view it this way. Therefore, the answer should reflect this nuance. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because the question asks about how workers view income inequality, which implies that there may be some who do not view it as unfair. Therefore, the answer should reflect this possibility as well. \nThe answer: Income inequality is generally viewed as unfair by workers, but there may be some who do not view it this way.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article discusses how wages are controlled by the market, which is a comparison between the supply and demand for skilled workers. Rule 3 applies because the concept of wages is distinct from other concepts like size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 applies because the article discusses how wages are not controlled by labor organizations or employers, but rather by the market. \nThe answer: the market", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, but wages are not any of these concepts, so this rule is not relevant. However, rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and the question asks about a comparison between wages and other goods, implying a negation. Therefore, the answer is that wages do not work in the same way as other goods.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in a purely capitalist mode of production, wages are determined by the market price of skill, which is a function of the law of supply and demand. Therefore, the relevant rules are that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts (rule 3) and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B (rule 8). \nThe answer: wages", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how markets, while determining wages based on supply and demand, can also lead to negative outcomes such as concentration of wealth and abuse of workers and consumers. Rule 3 emphasizes that concepts such as wealth and abuse are distinct from wages. Rule 4 emphasizes that profession and nationality are also distinct concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which applies to the negative outcomes mentioned in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Markets", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how markets, even when stable, can lead to high levels of inequality, which is widely viewed as unfair. This implies that stable markets can lead to negative outcomes. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concept of wages and other concepts like size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if a market leads to high levels of inequality, then it is likely that the opposite of inequality (i.e. fairness) is the antonym that should be used to describe the outcome. Rule 17 is relevant because it emphasizes that negations are important for the answer, and the question asks for a negative outcome. \nThe answer: High levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.", "{2, 4}\nExplanation: When there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. This is in line with rule 2, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, the job position is in high demand, making it most likely to have high wages. This is also in line with rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, meaning that the job position itself is what determines the wage, not the nationality or identity of the worker. \nThe answer: high demand for the job position", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of a situation where there are few workers for many jobs. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the phrase \"considered as,\" which implies a comparison. Rule 3 applies because size, shape, age, and color are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 applies because profession is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 applies because the question may contain synonyms. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"not.\" \nThe answer: low demand", "{2, 9, 15}\nExplanation: If there are few skilled workers but many available positions, then the job has low supply and high demand. According to rule 9, this will result in high wages for that job. Therefore, the potential earnings for such a job are high. \nThe answer: high", "{4, 9, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Labor organizations can limit the supply of workers, which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Additionally, members may receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption. Negations are important for the answer because the question asks for what can lead to higher wages, not what always leads to higher wages. In an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so the question is asking for the cause of higher wages, not the effect. Finally, profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the question mentions labor organizations does not imply a specific nationality. \nThe answer: Limiting the supply of workers, collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that a specific profession or nationality is responsible for working to get workers higher compensation. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" indicates that we should look for a negation in the question. The answer is therefore: no specific entity is mentioned in the article as working to get workers higher compensation.", "1, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the high supply of workers and low demand for the job means that the competition between workers drives down the wage. Rule 8 applies because the low wage for the job means that the job requires less of the particular skill or ability, making the worker more expendable. Rule 17 applies because the question is asking for the negative result of the situation. \nThe answer: a low wage for that job.", "{1, 2, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because there are many workers (A) and few job requirements (B), making A more supply than B, which means B is less supply than A. Rule 2 applies because many workers (A) are competing for a job that few require (B), making A most competition and B least competition. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking about what causes wages to decrease, which is a different concept than the number of workers or job requirements. Rule 17 applies because the question is asking about a negative effect (driving down wages). \nThe answer: competition between workers", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If there are many workers willing to work a job (high supply) and few require it (low demand), then there is a low wage for that job because competition between workers drives down the wage. This is due to the fact that the worker is expendable in relation to their particular job, and there are many other workers who can take their place.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: When there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), the wages for that job will be high. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Therefore, the answer is high wages. \nThe answer: high wages", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes that if A is less X than B, then B is more X than A. Rule 3 applies because it establishes that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The answer is: competition between employers.", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because higher economic inequality is more X (increases) than lower economic inequality. Rule 2 applies because necessity-based entrepreneurship is very X (often) based on survival needs, while opportunity-based entrepreneurship is somewhat X (more likely) to involve the pursuit of new products, services, or underserved market needs. Rule 3 applies because income and entrepreneurship are different concepts. \nThe answer: entrepreneurship rates at the individual level (self-employment)", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses two types of entrepreneurship: necessity-based and opportunity-based. Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs, such as income for food and shelter. Rule 2 applies because the passage describes the two types of entrepreneurship as least/most and push/pull motivations. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"survival,\" which is a negation and therefore important for the answer. \nThe answer: necessity-based entrepreneurship", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"food and shelter\" are concepts related to basic needs and survival, which are different from achievement-oriented motivations. Therefore, they are considered \"push\" motivations, which are the antonym of \"pull\" motivations. \nThe answer: \"push\" motivations", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that concepts such as motivation are different from concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"achievement-oriented motivations\" and \"self-determination\" are both examples of motivation, so they are the same concept. The answer is: pull motivations.", "{3, 8, 9}\nExplanation: The passage distinguishes between necessity-based entrepreneurship and opportunity-based entrepreneurship. The latter is \"more likely to involve the pursue of new products, services, or underserved market needs\" and is \"expected to foster technological progress.\" Therefore, opportunity-based entrepreneurship leads to advancements in technology.\nThe answer: opportunity-based entrepreneurship", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates. Rule 3 applies because the passage distinguishes between two types of entrepreneurship: necessity-based and opportunity-based. \nThe answer: higher economic inequality", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level, but most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity. Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter (\"push\" motivations). Therefore, the increased rates of self-employment are based on necessity.\nThe answer: necessity", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if higher economic inequality increases necessity-based entrepreneurship, then lower economic inequality decreases it. Rule 2 applies because necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by \"push\" motivations, while opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by \"pull\" motivations. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the type of entrepreneurship motivated by survival needs, which is a negation. \nThe answer: necessity-based entrepreneurship", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: Opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations (\"pull\").\nThe answer: achievement-oriented motivations", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: Opportunity-based entrepreneurship is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth.\nThe answer: positive impact", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a specific term that describes when the tax rate and base amount increase together. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so none of those terms would be relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the opposite of \"progressive\" would be \"regressive.\" Therefore, the answer is \"regressive.\" \n\nThe answer: Regressive.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that a progressive tax system, where the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases, can have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society. This means that the higher the top tax rate, the more it can decrease income inequality. Therefore, the tax rate that has a direct relationship with income inequality is the top tax rate in a progressive tax system.\nThe answer: top tax rate", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how a progressive tax system and steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if steeper tax progressivity can result in a more equal distribution of income, then less steep tax progressivity can result in a less equal distribution of income. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negation in the question. The question asks what can work to even the distribution of wealth, so the answer is steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending. \nThe answer: Steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending.", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and degrees of difference, which are important in understanding the impact of a system on income inequality. Rule 17 is relevant because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: progressive tax system", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that \"the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases,\" which means that as the taxable base amount increases, the tax rate also increases. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the question is asking about what increases as the taxable base amount increases, which is a matter of size (i.e. the size of the tax rate). \nThe answer: tax rate", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: A progressive tax system, where the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases, will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society. This is because the level of the top tax rate will affect the distribution of income, either increasing or decreasing inequality. The application of steeper tax progressivity to social spending can also result in a more equal distribution of income. \nThe answer: the level of the top tax rate", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that is relevant here is that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\". The passage states that steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. Therefore, less steep tax progressivity can result in a less equal distribution of income. \nThe answer: steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that \"steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board\" and that \"the difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.\" Therefore, the Gini index is an indicator of the effects of taxes applied to social spending.\nThe answer: Gini index", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the skills needed for high demand jobs, which implies that some individuals have more access to education and thus better skills than others. Rule 3 applies because the question is not about the physical attributes or characteristics of the skills themselves. \nThe answer: Education", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is relevant because it helps us understand that the answer is not \"nationality\" even though it is mentioned in the passage. Rule 8 is also relevant because it tells us that if people with higher education have more access to something, then people with lower education have less access to it. Therefore, the answer is education. \nThe answer: education", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Less education leads to lower wages.\nThe answer: lower wages.", "{1, 5, 19}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about \"limited\" productive potential, which implies that some individuals have more productive potential than others. Rule 5 applies because education and individuals' productive potential are different concepts. Rule 19 applies because the question does not specify a gender. \nThe answer: those with less access to education", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A has more of X than B, then B has less of X than A. In this case, those with lower incomes have less access to education than those with higher incomes. Rule 3 applies because it states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and none of these concepts are relevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about what those with lower incomes are less likely to have, which is a negation. \nThe answer: access to education", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article discusses how education can create high wages for those who have access to it, leading to inequality. Rule 3 applies because education is not the same concept as wages or income. Rule 17 applies because the article discusses how a lack of education leads to lower incomes. \nThe answer: Variation in individuals' access to education.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Education creates high wages for those with this education.\nThe answer: High wages", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: People unable to afford an education generally receive the least wages.\nThe answer: much lower wages.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Lack of education is directly linked to lower incomes.\nThe answer: lower incomes", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.\nThe answer: education", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that Standard & Poor recommended increasing access to education to remedy the wealth gap and slow growth. This falls under rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the wealth gap is causing slow growth, so increasing access to education would decrease the wealth gap and speed up growth. It also falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, as education is not a profession but rather a means to improve one's skills and knowledge. \nThe answer: increasing access to education", "{1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that if the average US worker had completed just one more year of school, it would add an additional $105 billion in growth to the country's economy over five years. This implies that more schooling could lead to potential economic growth.\nThe answer: $105 billion", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the widening disparity between the U.S.'s wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession and made it more prone to boom-and-bust cycles. The use of the word \"more prone\" indicates a higher risk. Additionally, the use of the word \"remedy\" suggests that there is a problem that needs to be fixed. Therefore, rules 3, 8, and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: boom-and-bust cycles", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the \"rising\" income inequality gap, implying that it has been getting worse. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about who concluded that the gap was not getting better, implying that someone had made that conclusion. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about who concluded that the gap was not getting better, implying a negation. \nThe answer: economists with the Standard & Poor's rating agency", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time when economists with the S&P's rating agency reached a conclusion. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a positive statement. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so we need to pay attention to the order of events. The passage states that \"In 2014, economists with the Standard & Poor's rating agency concluded...\" which means that the conclusion was reached in 2014.\nThe answer: 2014", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The widening disparity between the U.S.'s wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 2008-2009 recession.\nThe answer: during the 2008-2009 recession", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because increasing access to education would decrease the disparity between the wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation. Rule 3 applies because education is not related to size, shape, age, or color. Rule 4 applies because education is not related to profession or nationality. \nThe answer: increasing access to education", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of growth that would be generated if the average U.S. worker completed an additional year of school. This implies a positive effect on the economy, so we can apply rule 2 to infer that completing an additional year of school would result in the most growth. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to take the opposite of the statement given in the passage. Therefore, completing an additional year of school would add an additional $105 billion in growth to the country's economy over five years. \nThe answer: $105 billion", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between wealth disparity and the economy. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negative consequence of wealth disparity. \nThe answer: boom-and-bust cycles", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that the high school education movement occurred from 1910-1940.\nThe answer: 1910-1940", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: The high school education movement from 1910-1940 led to an increase in skilled workers and a decrease in the price of skilled labor, which caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. This means that the movement had a positive impact on the presence of skilled workers.\nThe answer: It led to an increase in skilled workers.", "{1, 2, 3, 17}\nExplanation: The movement led to an increase in skilled workers, which in turn led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. This caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. The negation in the question (\"what impact did...have on the wages\") and the use of the word \"decrease\" in the passage require the application of rules 1 and 17. \nThe answer: decreased", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Gender inequality in wages is impacted by profession, as certain professions may be dominated by one gender and therefore have different wage levels. Negations are important for the answer as the question asks for what impacts gender inequality, not what causes it. \nThe answer: profession", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If there is an increase in skilled workers, then the price of skilled labor decreases, making it less expensive for employers to hire skilled workers. This leads to a decrease in the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers, resulting in decreased inequality. \nThe answer: Increase in skilled workers", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the mass high school education movement occurred from 1910-1940.\nThe answer: 1910-1940", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the increase in skilled workers led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. Rule 4 applies because profession and wages are related concepts. \nThe answer: a decrease in the price of skilled labor.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that high school education during the mass education movement from 1910-1940 was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to perform at work, while present high school education is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This indicates a difference in the purpose of high school education between the two time periods.\nThe answer: It was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to perform at work, while present high school education is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the importance of education for the growth of the economy. \nThe answer: Education", "{3, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because the question asks for a negative outcome. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is relevant because the sentence \"creating a poverty trap\" is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: Gender inequality in education", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The article mentions \"the decline of union membership\" as one of the causes of economic inequality. This implies that labor unions are on a decline in the US. \nThe answer: labor unions", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available.\" This means that all continental European countries have higher economic mobility than the United States.\nThe answer: continental European countries", "{rule list: 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes.\" This implies that there is not much support for the US approach to economic development. Additionally, rule 2 applies because the passage compares the US approach to continental European liberalism, which has stronger unions. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the level of support, which is the antonym of \"little support.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the negation of a statement. \nThe answer: Little support", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The passage compares the effects of economic liberalism with and without strong unions, and concludes that the latter leads to better outcomes. Therefore, the policy that encourages labor unions is the one that promotes stronger unions, which is the opposite of reducing union membership. \nThe answer: a policy that promotes stronger unions", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Economic liberalism is one of the causes of economic inequality.\nThe answer: economic inequality", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. However, negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the phrase \"substantial levels\". The answer is: social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer are members of the CEPR, as stated in the article. The question uses the word \"organization\" which is a synonym for \"institution\", and the use of \"members\" implies that they belong to a specific group. Therefore, rules 4 and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: the CEPR", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because the question asks about the level of support for the view that labor-market flexibility improves labor-market outcomes, which implies a comparison between the level of support and the lack of support. The rule 8 applies because the question asks about the lack of support for the view, which implies a negation. \nThe answer: little support", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a comparison between the economic mobility of the US and European countries. Rule 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 is relevant because it clarifies that profession and nationality are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 5 is relevant because it clarifies that animals and vehicles are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 6 is relevant because it clarifies that animals and vehicles are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is relevant because it deals with antonyms and is necessary to understand that if the US has a lower level of economic mobility than European countries, then European countries have a higher level of economic mobility than the US. Rule 16 is relevant because it clarifies that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: The US economy consistently affords a lower level of economic", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A). The question asks for a country with low income inequality and high presence of unions. The passage mentions that nations with high rates of unionization, particularly in Scandinavia, have very low levels of inequality. Therefore, the answer is a Scandinavian country.", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Weak labor movements correlate with high inequality.\nThe answer: high inequality", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the decline of organized labor in the US has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization. This implies that the decline of organized labor has had a negative impact on the labor markets in the US. The use of \"negative impact\" indicates a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: the decline of organized labor", "{1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the decline of organized labor in the US has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization, which were also experienced by other industrialized nations that didn't experience steep surges in inequality. This implies that the US has been more affected by the decline of organized labor than other nations. Therefore, rules 1, 2, and 8 apply. \nThe answer: the decline of organized labor", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: Rosenfield's profession is mentioned in the article and is relevant to the question. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can use this rule to identify Rosenfield's profession. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can use this rule to avoid any gender bias in our answer.\nThe answer: Sociologist", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Jake Rosenfield is associated with the University of Washington, which is a college.\nThe answer: University of Washington", "{1, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The article discusses three factors that are often cited as contributing to the income gap: the decline of organized labor, technological changes, and globalization. Rosenfield argues that the decline of organized labor is the most significant factor. Rule 1 applies because the article compares the impact of different factors on the income gap. Rule 4 applies because profession and technology are different concepts. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the factor that plays the most significant role, which implies a comparison between factors. \nThe answer: the decline of organized labor", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Scandinavian nations are compared to other industrialized nations in terms of their level of inequality and rate of unionization. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant here, but the rule that comparisons using \"more\" or \"less\" can be flipped using antonyms is relevant. The answer is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that Scandinavian nations have high rates of unionization, which is linked to their low levels of inequality. Therefore, the answer is that Scandinavian nations have a high rate of unionization.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two concepts (inequality and weak labor movements) and their opposites. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: weak labor movements", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the competition from low-skilled workers in poor countries can lead to reduced wages for low-skilled workers in rich countries. Rule 2 applies because the low-skilled workers in rich countries are least skilled compared to the low-skilled workers in poor countries who may see increased wages. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the effect of trade with poorer countries on workers in richer countries. \nThe answer: reduced wages", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Trade with richer countries may increase wages for low-skilled workers in poorer countries (most X), while it may decrease wages for low-skilled workers in richer countries (least X). \nThe answer: increased wages", "{3, 4, 8, 16, 17, 19}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, profession and nationality are different concepts, if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, first comes before last and last comes after first, negations are important for the answer, a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession.\nThe answer: Technological innovation and automation.", "{3, 4, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is about what has replaced lower skilled workers in the United States. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about those topics. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about nationality. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the answer will be the opposite of \"low-skilled workers.\" Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can focus on the information about the United States. \nThe answer: machine labor/automation/technological innovation", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the scale that trade liberalization shifts economic inequality from, and the passage states that it shifts it from a global to a domestic scale. Therefore, the answer is domestic. \nThe answer: domestic", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages as a result of trade liberalization, while low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages. Therefore, the answer is: low-skilled workers in the poor countries.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Paul Krugman believes that trade liberalization, specifically increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of means of production, has had a measurable effect on rising inequality in the United States. This is due to low-skilled jobs becoming more tradeable and resulting in reduced wages for low-skilled workers in rich countries. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation. \nThe answer: increased trade with poor countries and fragmentation of means of production", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 2 applies because the question asks for a comparison between trade and other causes, and the answer states that trade has a minor effect compared to other causes. Rule 8 applies because the answer states that other causes have a greater effect on inequality than trade. \nThe answer: minor", "{3, 4, 5, 8}\nExplanation: Technological innovation and automation has replaced low-skilled jobs with machine labor in wealthier nations. \nThe answer: machine labor", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Botswana has a gender pay gap of 53%, which means that women earn 53% less than men.\nThe answer: 53%", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that gender and income are different concepts. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if there is a negative income gap in Bahrain, then the gender income inequality is in favor of females. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks about a negation (\"-40%\"), which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: -40% (in favor of females)", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (4) eliminates any potential confusion between the two. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A (8) helps us understand that the question is asking for the cause of the income inequality, rather than the actual difference in earnings. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts (3) is not relevant to this question.\nThe answer: Other factors, as there is still a difference in earnings between women and men even after accounting for them.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts eliminates any confusion about what \"advantage\" means in this context. Rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, allows us to understand that the wage gap provides an advantage to males. Rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer, ensures that we understand that the advantage is not provided to females. \nThe answer: males", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses the gender pay gap in many countries and mentions that on average, women earn less than men in the labor market. Rule 1 applies to the comparison between male and female earnings. Rule 4 applies to the distinction between profession and nationality. Rule 17 applies to the negation in the question. \nThe answer: Gender pay gap in favor of males", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks who the gender pay gap tends to favor, implying that there is a group that benefits more than the other. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about gender, which is a different concept from profession or nationality. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the word \"tend to,\" which implies that there may be exceptions to the general trend. \nThe answer: males", "{1, 4, 19}\nExplanation: Women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate.\nThe answer: women", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any irrelevant information about the author's nationality. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the author's name, not who is claimed to be the author. Therefore, the answer is: Thomas Sowell.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for what still exists even after other factors are accounted for. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for what still exists even after other factors are accounted for, implying that the other factors do not fully explain the difference. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the question or context. \nThe answer: a difference in earnings between women and men", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: We can infer from the passage that social welfare programs are a type of redistribution mechanism that can help to reduce economic inequality. \nThe answer: social welfare programs", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that \"countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth.\" Therefore, underdeveloped countries have low levels of economic inequality. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and is not relevant to this question.\nThe answer: relatively equal distributions of wealth", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about what introduces inequality, which implies that there was a previous state of equality. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves the concept of wealth distribution. \nThe answer: the acquisition of capital", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: As per rule 1, if A has more of X than B, then B has less of X than A. In this case, the article states that countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth. Therefore, as a country moves towards higher levels of development, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality. Thus, the answer is lower levels of development. \nThe answer: lower levels of development.", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: Simon Kuznets' profession is relevant to the question, and according to rule 4, profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 19 also states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession.\nThe answer: Economist", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are the result of stages of development, with countries at low levels of development having relatively equal distributions of wealth, and more developed countries having higher levels of inequality due to the acquisition of more capital by a wealthy few. \nThe answer: economic inequality", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant because they help us understand that \"levels of economic inequality\" are not a physical attribute that a country acquires, but rather a result of the country's economic development. Therefore, the answer is \"more capital.\"", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The first rule applies because the sentence compares the wealth of owners of more capital to those with less capital. The third rule applies because the question is asking about a concept related to wealth. \nThe answer: more wealth and income", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is not relevant here, as there are no negations in the question. The rules that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are also not relevant. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"if A is more X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X.\" The passage states that \"through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.\" Therefore, redistribution mechanisms lead to lower levels of inequality.\nThe answer: lower levels of inequality", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 8 apply because the question asks about a comparison of income inequality over time. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: from 1910 to 1940", "{rule list: 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for when income inequality began to increase in the US, which implies that there was a time when it was decreasing. The passage states that income inequality fell in the US during the High school movement from 1910 to 1940, but began to rise after the 1970s. The use of \"after\" implies a comparison between two time periods, which is a form of negation. Therefore, rules 2 (comparative adjectives), 8 (antonyms), and 17 (negations) are relevant.\nThe answer: after the 1970s", "{3, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a possible new Kuznets cycle occurring from the manufacturing sector to the service sector, indicating that jobs in the service sector are beginning to increase. Additionally, the question contains a synonym for \"jobs\" with \"sector.\" The rules selected help to identify the relevant information and account for negations and synonyms.\nThe answer: service sector", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that there may be another Kuznets' cycle occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector. This implies that jobs in the manufacturing sector are beginning to decrease.\nThe answer: Manufacturing sector", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the person who plotted the relationship between levels of income and inequality. Rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different from concepts such as profession and nationality. Therefore, we can infer that the answer will be a person's name. \nThe answer: Kuznets", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of confusion between \"level of income\" and \"level of inequality.\" The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the question asks for the term used to describe the opposite of a decrease in income inequality. The answer is \"bulging out.\" \nThe answer: bulging out", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what Kuznets predicted. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the negation of Kuznets' theory. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the result of recent testing. \nThe answer: very weak", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. Rule 2 applies because the article also mentions that income inequality did fall in the United States during a certain period, but recent data shows that it began to rise again, which does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory. Therefore, the answer is that Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because the article mentions that income inequality fell during the High school movement from 1910 to 1940, but began to rise after the 1970s. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the article suggests that another Kuznets' cycle may be occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector. \nThe answer: multiple Kuznets' cycles", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the process that attributes new wealth to those that already have it, which is the opposite of attributing it to those who do not have it. \nThe answer: wealth concentration", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for an advantage that the wealthy have, implying that they have more of something than others. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about the advantage in accumulating new wealth, which is related to their profession as wealthy individuals. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for an advantage, which is a positive statement, and negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The wealthy have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the highest impact, which implies a comparison. Rule 3 applies because size, in this context, refers to the amount of wealth. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the highest impact, which implies a comparison of the opposite concept. \nThe answer: the return of capital (r)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article discusses how those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth. This means that having more money tends to lead to even more money.\nThe answer: having more wealth", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If already-wealthy individuals have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth, they are the beneficiaries of the new wealth, leading to wealth concentration. If A has more wealth than B, then B has less wealth than A. Therefore, if newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals, it does not concentrate in the possession of those who are not already wealthy. Thus, the answer is in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about a group of people, not a specific individual. \nThe answer: already-wealthy individuals or entities", "3, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as wealth and inequality are different. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, if wealth concentration contributes to the persistence of inequality, then the lack of wealth concentration would contribute to the reduction of inequality. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for what can contribute to the continuing inequality, so the answer is wealth concentration. \nThe answer: Wealth concentration.", "{rule list: 16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps to determine the order of the names in the sentence, and the rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Thomas Piketty", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for what larger fortunes generate, which is a positive statement. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so it is not relevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can use \"generate\" as a synonym for \"contribute to\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in the question. Therefore, we only need to apply rule 7 to extract the answer.\nThe answer: higher returns", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article discusses how market forces should serve as a brake on wealth concentration. Rule 2 applies because the article contrasts market forces with non-market forces such as rent-seeking. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the forces that should prevent wealth concentration. \nThe answer: market forces", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: Stiglitz's profession is mentioned in the article, and rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can focus on his profession without being distracted by his nationality. Rule 19 also states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. \nThe answer: Economist", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: The market bids up compensation for rare and desired skills that contribute to wealth creation and greater productivity.\nThe answer: rare and desired skills that contribute to wealth creation and greater productivity", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is also not relevant. The relevant rules are rule 4, which states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A,\" rule 7, which states that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph,\" and rule 17, which states that \"negations are important for the answer.\" The answer is \"political power.\"", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that income obtained not from creating wealth but from \"grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort\" is known to economists as \"rent-seeking.\" This is a specific term used in the passage and is not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles. Negations are important for the answer as the question asks for the term used to describe income obtained not from creating wealth. \nThe answer: rent-seeking", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"higher rates\" implies a comparison between different levels of the same concept. Rule 3 applies because \"health\" and \"social problems\" are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for examples of effects, which implies a negation of the absence of effects. \nThe answer: inequality", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because it helps us understand that a lower level of economic growth occurs when resources are devoted to high-end consumption instead of investing in human capital. The answer is that human capital is neglected for high-end consumption. \n\nThe answer: Human capital is neglected for high-end consumption.", "{1, 2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Countries with more inequality have lower life expectancy.\nThe answer: life expectancy", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so \"lower rate of social goods\" is a different concept from health and social problems. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so a lower rate of social goods is the antonym of a higher level of social goods. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer is \"higher rates of social problems.\" \nThe answer: higher rates of social problems.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" is relevant because the question asks about the effect of economic inequality on life expectancy, and the rule helps us understand that less economically equal states have lower life expectancy. \nThe answer: It is lower.", "{rule list: 16, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of the Nobel prize winner and the year they won.\nThe answer: 2013", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem.\" This is a direct answer to the question.\nThe answer: rising inequality", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that \"Increasing inequality harms economic growth.\" Rule 2 applies because the passage states that \"High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the effect of unemployment on economic growth, and the passage states that \"Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict.\" \nThe answer: It has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that unemployment can erode self-esteem, which is a negative effect of high and persistent unemployment. This is an example of a negation being important for the answer. Additionally, the concept of self-esteem is different from the concepts of size, shape, age, and color, so rule 3 applies. \nThe answer: unemployment", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the passage states that increasing inequality harms economic growth, so reducing the inequality-associated effects of unemployment would support economic growth. Rule 4 applies because profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is asking about the type of growth that is supported, not the nationality of the growth. Rule 17 applies because the question includes the word \"reduce,\" which is a negation and therefore important for the answer. \nThe answer: economic growth", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: British", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: If there is higher inequality, then there are higher rates of health and social problems such as obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, and drug use. \nThe answer: higher rates of health and social problems", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant here. The passage states that countries and states with higher inequality have lower rates of social goods, so we can infer that countries and states with lower inequality have higher rates of social goods. Therefore, we can say that the rates of social goods are higher in countries with lower inequality. \nThe answer: higher", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by using the rule that negations are important for the answer and the rule that if two entities are listed, then \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last. The passage states that the researchers used statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, so the answer is 23.\nThe answer: 23", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because the question asks about a positive correlation between two concepts. The rule 8 applies because the question asks about the opposite of a comparison. \nThe answer: equality", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because \"higher material living standards\" is a comparative concept. Rule 3 applies because \"health and longer lives\" are different concepts from \"material living standards\". \nThe answer: Better health and longer lives.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between higher material living standards and longer lives. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of income and life expectancy. \nThe answer: among poorer countries", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that \"life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases\" and Rule 3 applies because \"life expectancy\" and \"per capita income\" are different concepts.\nThe answer: Life expectancy", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if A lives no longer than B, then B lives longer than A. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that Americans live no longer on average than Greeks and New Zealanders. \nThe answer: Americans", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Sweden's income is more equally distributed than in other countries.\nThe answer: income was more equally distributed", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because income inequality is being compared between countries. Rule 3 applies because income inequality is a concept separate from health. Rule 8 applies because income inequality is being compared to its antonym, equality. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a characteristic that is tied to health, implying that there may be other factors that also affect health. \nThe answer: Income inequality.", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the creator of an index related to health and social problems. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the names of the creators. Rule 3 and 4 tell us that we should not confuse concepts, such as health and income, or profession and nationality. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms, so we need to recognize that \"index of health and social problems\" is the same as \"index of child well-being in rich countries\". Therefore, the answer is Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett. \n\nThe answer: Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Creating an index of 'Health and Social Problems' from nine factors, authors Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett found health and social problems 'more common in countries with bigger income inequalities'\". Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from number, so we can infer that the answer is a specific number of factors. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use this rule to infer that if the authors identified nine factors, then any number less than nine would not be accurate, and any number more than nine would be more than what the authors identified. Therefore, the answer is nine.\nThe answer: nine", "{1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that health and social problems are \"more common in countries with bigger income inequalities\" and \"more common among states in the US with larger income inequalities.\" Therefore, if income inequality is more prevalent in country A than in country B, then health and social problems are more prevalent in country A than in country B. \nThe answer: in countries and states with bigger income inequalities.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being \"per capita income\" since income is not a concept related to child well-being. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies since the passage states that child well-being correlates with greater equality but not per capita income, implying that income inequality is the more important factor. \nThe answer: income inequality", "{1, 3, 5, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if violence is more common in societies with larger income differences, then societies with smaller income differences have less violence. Rule 3 applies because crime rate and inequality are different concepts. Rule 5 applies because violence and vehicles are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a correlation, which is a negation. \nThe answer: inequality", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates those as possible answers. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the question asks for something that is \"almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions.\" The answer is homicides. \n\nThe answer: homicides", "{1, 7, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a correlation between crime rate and inequality, which implies that higher inequality is associated with higher crime rates. Rule 7 applies because the question uses the synonym \"violence\" instead of \"crime rate.\" Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the number of studies that have shown a positive correlation, which implies that there are studies that have shown a negative correlation. \nThe answer: over fifty", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies to \"violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger\" and implies that \"violence is less common in societies where income differences are smaller.\" Rule 2 applies to \"about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state\" and implies that \"the other half of all variation in homicide rates cannot be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state.\" Rule 3 applies to \"homicides\" and \"variation in homicide rates\" and implies that they are different concepts. Rule 4 applies to \"U.S States and Canadian Provinces\" and \"developed countries with undeveloped countries\" and implies that they are different concepts. Rule 5 applies to \"homicides\" and \"comments in academic literature\" and implies that they are different concepts. Rule 6 applies to \"U.S States and Canadian Provinces\" and \"worldwide\" and implies that they are different concepts. Rule 7", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Daly et al. found a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality among US states and Canadian provinces, and estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state. This means that the answer is \"about half\" or \"50%\". \nThe answer: about half / 50%", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: The utilitarian principle seeks the greatest good for the greatest number of people, which is a utilitarian concept. The answer can be found directly in the first sentence of the passage. Additionally, rules 3 and 17 are relevant because they clarify that \"utility\" refers to the satisfaction or benefit derived from something, and that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The greatest good for the greatest number", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for an example of reduced something, which implies a comparison between two entities. Therefore, the answer is reduced \"distributive efficiency\". \nThe answer: distributive efficiency", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if a dollar spent by a poor person is likely to provide basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare, then a dollar spent by a rich person is likely to provide luxury items. \nThe answer: basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare", "{rule 2, rule 8}\nExplanation: As a person becomes richer, the marginal utility of wealth per person decreases. This means that an additional dollar spent by a poor person will provide more utility than an additional dollar spent by a richer person. Therefore, the marginal utility of wealth per income per person decreases as that person becomes richer. \nThe answer: It decreases.", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the opposite of economic inequality. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about a societal characteristic. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the effect of a specific factor on a society. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a positive outcome. \nThe answer: higher aggregate utility", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for what conservative researchers believe should be the measure of inequality, and the passage states that they argue that consumption, rather than income, should be the measure. Therefore, if income is more unequal than consumption, then consumption is more equal than income. \nThe answer: consumption", "{rule list: 4, 18}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"negations in the question are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the political leaning of the Cato Institute, which is a negation of asking for their political affiliation. The answer is: libertarian.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2001", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The name \"Thomas B. Edsall\" is mentioned in the passage as the author of \"The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor\".\nThe answer: Thomas B. Edsall", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Thomas B. Edsall is a journalist.\nThe answer: journalist", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: Raghuram Rajan is referred to as a \"Central Banking economist\", indicating his profession in the field of economics. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so his nationality is not relevant to the answer. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. \nThe answer: economist", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Rajan is discussing economic inequalities and their effects. Rule 3 applies because the concept of economic inequality is different from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 applies because Rajan is discussing the negative effects of economic inequalities, implying that they are more harmful than beneficial. \nThe answer: systematic economic inequalities", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"systematic economic inequalities...have made [financial] crises more likely to happen than in the past\" and cites the Financial crisis of 2007-08 as the most recent example. The use of \"most recent\" implies that there may have been other examples in the past. The rule about negations is also relevant because the question asks for the example of financial fault lines, which is a negative aspect of the economy. \nThe answer: Financial crisis of 2007-08", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found in the sentence \"To compensate for stagnating and declining purchasing power, political pressure has developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income earners \u2013 particularly to buy homes \u2013 and easier credit in general to keep unemployment rates low.\" The answer is easier credit. \nThe answer: easier credit", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the article states that the American economy has a tendency to go \"from bubble to bubble\" due to \"unsustainable monetary stimulation.\" This implies that the economy experiences periods of growth and expansion (bubbles) that are not sustainable in the long term. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" applies because the answer is not related to any of these concepts. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" applies because the question uses the phrase \"tendency to go 'from bubble to bubble'\" which is a synonym for the phrase \"systematic economic inequalities...have made [financial] crises more likely to happen than in the past\" mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: unsustainable monetary stimulation", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells. This means that as inequality in wealth and income increases, the duration of economic growth spells decreases. Therefore, the answer is inequality in wealth and income.", "3, 4, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate nationality as a possible answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"prevent\" in the question. Therefore, the answer is: the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education.", "1, 8, 17, 19\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the relationship between the income share of the top 20 percent and GDP growth. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the effect of an increase in the income share of the top 20 percent. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the negation of the relationship between income share and GDP growth. Rule 19 applies because the question is about the relationship between income share and GDP growth, which is a concept separate from gender. \nThe answer: GDP growth actually declines over the medium term.", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 8 apply because the question asks about the relationship between the income share of the bottom 20 percent and GDP growth, which is a comparison of two quantities. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the positive effect of an increase in income share. \nThe answer: higher GDP growth", "{1, 2, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage discusses the negative correlation between inequality and economic growth, implying that if one group (e.g. the rich) is more X, then the other group (e.g. the poor) is less X. Rule 2 applies because the passage compares the effects of increasing the income share of the top 20% versus the bottom 20%, implying that the former is very X and the latter is most X. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about a concept (economic growth) and the passage discusses the importance of different groups (the poor and middle class) for that concept. Rule 17 applies because the question uses negation (\"not just economic prosperity\") to indicate that there are other factors at play. \nThe answer: the poor and the middle class", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: The question asks for the profession of two individuals, so rule 4 applies to ensure that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 19 applies to ensure that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. \nThe answer: The article does not provide information about their profession.", "3, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that increasing inequality harms economic growth. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can also infer that increasing inequality harms economic growth, rather than benefiting it. \nThe answer: Economic growth", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that \"increasing inequality harms economic growth\" and \"high and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth.\" Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the negative effect on something, which is different from the concept of unemployment itself. \nThe answer: subsequent long-run economic growth", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Unemployment harms growth because it is a waste of resources, generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. (negation of the positive effects of employment)", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that unemployment generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Therefore, policies that aim to control unemployment and reduce its inequality-associated effects support economic growth. \nThe answer: inequality-associated effects", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: If global inequality prevents growth, then reducing global inequality would promote growth. Therefore, Stiglitz presented evidence that reducing global inequality would promote growth. \nThe answer: evidence that reducing global inequality would promote growth", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that both global inequality and inequality within countries limit aggregate demand, which in turn limits growth. Rule 3 applies because the concept of growth is different from the concepts of size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: Inequality limits aggregate demand and therefore limits growth.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Milanovic and Stiglitz are both economists who presented evidence that income inequality harms growth.\nThe answer: economists", "{2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the main reason for the shift to the view that income inequality harms growth is the increasing importance of human capital in development. This means that in the past, when physical capital was more important, savings and investments were key, and having a large contingent of rich people who could save more and invest in physical capital was important. However, now that human capital is scarcer than machines, widespread education has become the secret to growth. Therefore, rule 2 applies because it explains the relationship between income inequality and growth, rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between physical and human capital, and rule 8 applies because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: the increasing importance of human capital in development", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"widespread education has become the secret to growth.\" This refers to the importance of human capital in development, which is a different concept from physical capital (rule 3) and from the contingent of rich people who could invest in physical capital (rule 4).\nThe answer: widespread education", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1993", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a detrimental effect on human capital formation. Rule 3 applies because human capital formation and economic development are different concepts. \nThe answer: detrimental effect", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the subject of a 1996 study by Perotti. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Perotti is a researcher is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for what the study examined, not what it found. The answer is that the study examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. \nThe answer: the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth", "{rules 1, 2, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Inequality is associated with lower levels of human capital formation and higher levels of fertility, which in turn lead to lower levels of growth. This is because credit market imperfections make it difficult for individuals to invest in education and training, and also because high levels of inequality lead to political and social instability. Additionally, inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which can lead to lower levels of private savings and investment. Therefore, inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation.\nThe answer: redistributive taxation", "{rule list: 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Extremely unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth. (negation in the question and antonym rule)", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 2 applies because \"high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries\". Rule 8 applies because \"if A reduces X in B, then B increases X when compared to A\". \nThe answer: High levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries.", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: When comparing high levels of inequality in relatively poor countries versus richer countries, rule 2 applies. In relatively poor countries, high levels of inequality reduce growth, but in richer countries, they encourage growth. Rule 8 applies, stating that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, high levels of inequality encourage growth in richer countries, but do not necessarily have a negative impact on growth. \nThe answer: Encourage growth.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the level of income inequality to the rates of growth and investment. Rule 3 applies because income inequality and rates of growth and investment are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment. \nThe answer: little overall relation", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Harvard", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states \"A study of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less, but no correlation after ten years.\"\nThe answer: between 1960 and 2000", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the Kuznets curve hypothesis suggests that with economic development, inequality first increases (A is more X than B), then decreases (B is more antonym(X) than A). Rule 2 applies because the Kuznets curve hypothesis is described as \"magical\" and cannot account for the significant increase in economic inequality since the 1970s, suggesting that it is a very X concept. \nThe answer: the Kuznets curve hypothesis", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the opposite of the initial statement in the Kuznets curve hypothesis. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the point at which inequality will decrease. \nThe answer: first increases", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for someone who challenges the Kuznets curve hypothesis, which implies that there are people who do not challenge it. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for someone who challenges the notion of the Kuznets curve hypothesis, which implies that the Kuznets curve hypothesis is being negated. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"who,\" which implies that the answer is a person. \nThe answer: Thomas Piketty", "{4, 19}\nExplanation: Thomas Piketty is an economist.\nThe answer: Economist", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the factor that reduced inequality, implying that inequality was higher before. Rule 3 applies because \"biggest factors\" implies that there were multiple factors. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for what Piketty feels was the biggest factor, indicating that there may be differing opinions. \nThe answer: wars and \"violent economic and political shocks\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1970s", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the sentence compares the effect of savings by the wealthy in relation to inequality. Rule 3 applies because savings and inequality are different concepts. Rule 8 applies because the sentence mentions a positive effect of savings by the wealthy, implying that reduced savings by the wealthy would have a negative effect. \nThe answer: reduced consumer demand", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Inequality is sometimes thought to have a positive effect on economic development, and the article mentions a 2013 report on Nigeria that suggests growth has risen with increased income inequality. However, the IMF found that lower levels of inequality are associated with sustained periods of economic growth. The question asks for what the 2013 report suggests about Nigeria's growth, so we must take into account the negation in the question. Therefore, the answer is that the 2013 report suggests that Nigeria's growth has not decreased despite increased income inequality. \nThe answer: Nigeria's growth has not decreased despite increased income inequality.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be inferred from the passage that analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. Therefore, we need to consider the negation in the question and use rule 8 to determine that the answer is \"several years\". \nThe answer: several years", "{3, 8, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 8 is relevant because the question asks about the opposite of a positive effect, which is a negative effect. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks about what longer growth spells are associated with, which is a positive effect. Rule 23 is relevant because the passage discusses the association between inequality and economic growth. \nThe answer: more equality in the income distribution", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth.\" This implies that some action needs to be taken to ensure their participation. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"ensure,\" which is a synonym for \"make certain.\" Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"need,\" which implies a negation. The answer is: special efforts.", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction can depend on the existing level of inequality, which is an example of rule 1. Additionally, the passage provides an example of how the time it takes to achieve poverty reduction can vary based on the level of inequality, which is an example of rule 2.\nThe answer: the existing level of inequality", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the question asks about the opposite of what a country with low inequality can achieve in ten years. The rule \"negations in the question are important for the answer\" also applies because the question asks about what takes longer to achieve. \nThe answer: It takes a country with high inequality nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction in poverty that a country with low inequality can achieve in ten years.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Ban Ki-Moon was the Secretary General of the United Nations.\nThe answer: United Nations", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Economic growth is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.\nThe answer: reducing poverty", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: much land and housing", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article explains that unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements. This is a description of the concept of ownership, which falls under rule 3. The article also mentions excessive bureaucratic red tape and failures to notarize transaction documents as reasons for extra-legal ownership, which are related to legal procedures and documentation, falling under rule 4.\nThe answer: Through various associations and other arrangements.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: extra-legal ownership", "{rule list: 2, 10}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because the question uses the phrase \"over how many steps\" which implies a comparison. The rule 10 applies because the question contains a contraction. \nThe answer: over 200 steps", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that in some countries, it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land due to excessive bureaucratic red tape. \nThe answer: government land", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Researchers argue that a shortage of affordable housing is caused in part by income inequality.\nThe answer: affordable housing", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: number of quality rental units", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: gentrification", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.\" This means that the combination of rising prices and the ad valorem property tax policy made it difficult for poor people to keep up. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply. \nThe answer: ad valorem property tax policy", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The rule states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The passage mentions that certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education, and health care. These are different concepts, not related to each other by size, shape, age, or color.\nThe answer: They are shared by everyone.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that those on lower incomes are worse equipped to manage their finances. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for something that those with lower incomes are unable to manage, which implies a difficulty or challenge. \nThe answer: their finances", "{1, 2, 7}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the concept of \"aspirational consumption\" where middle income earners aspire to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts. This term is a synonym for the answer to the question.\nThe answer: aspirational consumption", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: taking on debt", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because taking on debt means that people are in a less financially stable position than those who do not have debt. Rule 3 applies because the concept of debt is different from the concepts of housing, pensions, education, and health care. \nThe answer: potential economic instability", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: When economic inequality is smaller, waste and pollution is more. This follows from rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, economic inequality is the X factor, and waste and pollution are the Y factor. Therefore, when economic inequality is smaller (A is less X), waste and pollution is more (B is more Y). Rule 3 also applies, as waste and pollution are distinct concepts from economic inequality. \nThe answer: created", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier.\" Therefore, if there were fewer people, the multiplier would be lower and the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. This is in line with rule 3, which states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: the amount of environmental degradation", "{3, 8, 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that waste and pollution are different concepts. Rule 8 is relevant because the question asks about the impact of population on the environment, which is a comparison of two concepts. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes the order of concepts in the question. Rule 22 is relevant because it clarifies that \"current\" refers to the last concept mentioned, which is population. \nThe answer: The current high level of population has a large impact on the amount of environmental degradation.", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that \"as the poor people in the society become more wealthy, it increases their yearly carbon emissions.\" Rule 3 applies because the passage distinguishes between economic inequality and environmental degradation. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about addressing human inequality without increasing environmental damage. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a positive solution rather than a negation. \nThe answer: If population levels drop to a sustainable level, human inequality can be addressed/corrected without resulting in an increase of environmental damage.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners. This falls under rule 3, as it refers to the concept of ownership. It also falls under rule 4, as it refers to a political ideology rather than a nationality or profession.\nThe answer: private ownership of the means of production", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Private ownership creates a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income, while the vast majority is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. This is a situation of vast disparities in wealth.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also not relevant. The answer is \"income in the form of a wage or salary.\"", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Socialists believe that the means of production should be socially owned. This means that private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners should be eliminated. This aligns with rule 3, which states that ownership is a different concept from profession, and rule 4, which states that nationality is a different concept from ownership. \nThe answer: Socially owned", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the relationship between income differentials and individual contributions to the social product. Rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts from age and color, so income differentials and individual contributions are also different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if income differentials were reflective of individual contributions, then they would not be based on unearned property income from ownership titles. \nThe answer: reflective of individual contributions to the social product", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Robert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force (usually in the form of taxation).\" Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, and the question is asking about an argument made by a person, not their nationality. Rule 17 is relevant because the question uses the word \"argues,\" which is a negation, and therefore the answer must be the person who made the argument, not the opposite. \nThe answer: Robert Nozick", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the \"usual form\" of government wealth redistribution, which implies that it is done through forceful means. This is in line with rule 3, which states that force is a different concept from other factors like size or shape. Rule 4 also applies, as the question is asking about the government's actions, which is a different concept from nationality. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if the government redistributes wealth by force, then the opposite of force (i.e. voluntary means) is not the usual form of wealth redistribution. Finally, rule 17 is important because it states that negations are important for the answer, and the question is asking for the \"usual\" form of wealth redistribution, implying that there are other forms that may be less common. \nThe answer: taxation", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between government and force, which is relevant to Nozick's argument. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between government and citizens, which is relevant to the concept of citizens being free from something. Rule 17 applies because it establishes that negations are important for the answer, and the question is asking for what citizens would be free from, implying a negation. \nThe answer: force", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks how the inequalities were created, implying that they were created through some form of force or action. Rule 8 applies because the passage mentions that Nozick believed some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property. \nThe answer: through forceful taking of property", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 2 applies because the question asks about when inequalities in wealth are justified, which implies that there are situations where they are not justified. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a specific condition under which inequalities are justified. \nThe answer: Inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole, including the poorest members.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant because they help us understand that poverty is not a physical attribute that can be compared in terms of size, shape, age, or color. The answer is \"capability deprivation\". \nThe answer: capability deprivation", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the end itself", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the goal of the capabilities approach, which is a concept related to economics and social justice. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that concepts such as income and poverty are different from concepts such as capability deprivation. Rule 4 is also relevant because it clarifies that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is not directly related to the question but helps to avoid confusion. Rule 17 is relevant because it clarifies that negations are important for the answer, and the question specifically asks for the goal of the capabilities approach, not what it is not. \nThe answer: The goal of the capabilities approach is to widen people's choices and the level of their achieved well-being through increasing functionings, capabilities, and agency.", "{2, 3}\nExplanation: The capabilities approach aims to widen people's choices and level of well-being by increasing their functionings, capabilities, and agency. This means that the approach focuses on increasing the things that people value doing, the freedom to enjoy those things, and the ability to pursue valued goals, rather than just focusing on economic growth and income as an end goal. \nThe answer: By increasing functionings, capabilities, and agency.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the ability to pursue valued goals", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if a person's capabilities are lowered, they are less able to earn income than someone with higher capabilities. Rule 3 applies because the concept of capabilities is different from the concept of income. \nThe answer: They are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that age is a different concept from capabilities, and the rule 8 states that if A is more capable than B, then B is less capable than A. Therefore, an old, ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man.\nThe answer: earn as much as a healthy young man", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, but gender roles and customs may prevent women from working or receiving education. Negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for issues that prevent women from working or receiving education. \nThe answer: Gender roles and customs.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: fear of their lives", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but the passage suggests that if people are not denied their functionings, capabilities, and agency, they can work towards a better relevant income. This is implied by the statement that when a person's capabilities are lowered, they are deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise, and that to prevent inequality, it's important to ensure that people have the freedom and opportunities to work towards a better income. \nThe answer: a better relevant income", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a person's profession, which is not related to their nationality. \n{rule list: names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a specific person's role in producing the show. \nThe answer: the BBC", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that Doctor Who has been produced by the BBC since 1963, which means that it first aired on TV in that year. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the year mentioned in the article refers to the first airing of the show. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed, which in this case is the BBC, and \"latter\" refers to the last entity listed, which is Doctor Who. Therefore, we can conclude that Doctor Who first aired on TV in 1963.\nThe answer: 1963", "{3, 4, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The rules state that \"vehicles and animals are different concepts\" (rule 6) and that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (rule 4), so we know that the answer is not a profession or a nationality. Additionally, \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" (rule 3), so the answer is not related to any of those. Finally, \"names are equally important for the answer\" (rule 13), so we know that the answer will be a specific name. Therefore, the answer is: TARDIS.", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer should not include any of these concepts. The rule 10 states that typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore any misspellings. \nThe answer: a blue British police box.", "{rule list: 4, 5}\nExplanation: Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme.\nThe answer: science-fiction", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989.\"\nThe answer: 1963 to 1989", "{4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that the answer will be a person's name, and the rules about first and last names tell us that the answer will be the first name mentioned after the year 2005. The rule about gendered pronouns tells us that the answer will be a male name. \nThe answer: Russell", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures as possible answers, as they are not professions. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates K-9 as a possible answer, as it is a vehicle. The answer is K-9 and Company. \nThe answer: K-9 and Company", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who produced the Doctor Who revival series. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so knowing that Russell T Davies was the showrunner and head writer does not necessarily mean he produced the series. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the first series of the 21st century, which featured Christopher Eccleston in the title role, was produced by the BBC. Therefore, the answer is the BBC. \nThe answer: the BBC", "{1, 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: We need to identify the actor who played the Doctor in the revival series. Rule 1 helps us understand that if we know who played the Doctor, we also know who did not play the Doctor. Rule 4 helps us understand that the actor's nationality is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 helps us understand that the actor's name comes after the title \"Doctor Who.\" Rule 20 helps us understand that \"he\" refers to male names. \nThe answer: Christopher Eccleston", "{3, 4, 6}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the number of actors who have played the role of Doctor Who, which is a profession. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is relevant. Rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so it is not relevant. Therefore, the answer is: 12.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from profession is not relevant to this question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because the question asks about who followed Matt Smith, implying that he came first. Therefore, the answer is Peter Capaldi. \nThe answer: Peter Capaldi", "{1, 3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if an actor takes on the role after another actor's exit, then the former comes after the latter. Rule 3 is relevant because it establishes that the concept of regeneration is different from the concept of the actor's portrayal. Rule 4 is relevant because it establishes that an actor's nationality is different from their profession. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the last actor to play the Doctor comes before the next actor. \nThe answer: \"The Time of the Doctor\"", "{1, 2, 15}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the transition from one actor to another, which implies a comparison of two entities. Rule 2 applies because the question mentions that each new incarnation brings a new personality. Rule 15 applies because the question refers to the process of regeneration, which is when the Doctor takes on a new body. \nThe answer: After sustaining an injury which would be fatal to most other species.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 that \"each actor's portrayal differs, but they are all intended to be aspects of the same character and form part of the same storyline\" is relevant, as it implies that the Doctor's personality changes with each regeneration. Rule 8, which states that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" is also relevant, as it allows us to infer that if the Doctor's personality changes with each regeneration, then their personality before the regeneration is different from their personality after the regeneration. \nThe answer: the Doctor's personality", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The article states that the primary character of Doctor Who is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. This means that the answer is Gallifrey.\nThe answer: Gallifrey", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The article states that the primary character of Doctor Who fled from Gallifrey in a stolen Mark I Type 40 TARDIS, which is a time machine that allows him to travel across time and space. The TARDIS has a \"chameleon circuit\" which normally allows the machine to take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise, but it remains fixed as a blue British Police box due to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit. Therefore, the answer is \"Mark I Type 40 TARDIS\".", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: TARDIS stands for \"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\", which is a time machine that allows the primary character in Doctor Who to travel across time and space. The TARDIS has a \"chameleon circuit\" which normally allows the machine to take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise, but the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British Police box due to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The question asks about a feature that allows the TARDIS to disguise itself, which refers to its shape. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is related to the TARDIS's shape-changing ability. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the TARDIS has a \"chameleon circuit\" that normally allows it to take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise, which means that the TARDIS can change its shape. Therefore, the answer is the \"chameleon circuit\". \nThe answer: The \"chameleon circuit\".", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article explains that the Doctor's TARDIS has a malfunction in its \"chameleon circuit,\" which is supposed to allow it to take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise. As a result, it remains fixed as a blue British Police box. This is due to a problem with the TARDIS's technology, specifically the chameleon circuit. \nThe answer: Due to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: rarely", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that being a Time Lord is not a profession, but rather a characteristic of a certain species. Therefore, we can use rule 8 to conclude that the antonym of \"Time Lord\" is \"not a Time Lord\". The passage also mentions that the Doctor has enemies, including the Master, who is described as \"another renegade Time Lord\". Therefore, the answer is the Master. \nThe answer: the Master", "{3, 15, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be confused with each other. Rule 15 states that if a person had profession X but changed to profession Y, then they have profession Y. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: The Doctor regenerates, taking on a new appearance and personality.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question, as it does not involve either concept. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also not relevant. The answer is found in the sentence \"His companions are usually humans,\" indicating that the Doctor usually takes humans with him on his travels. \nThe answer: humans", "{3, 4, 19}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts such as size, shape, age, and color from each other. Rule 4 separates profession and nationality. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. Therefore, the answer is: Time Lord.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Saturday, 23 November 1963", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any mention of these concepts in the passage is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the passage mentions that a certain creature was not popular, then it can be inferred that the answer is not that creature. The answer: Daleks.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that story editor David Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. Therefore, David Whitaker is the one who commissioned the story, but Terry Nation is the one who wrote it. \nThe answer: Terry Nation", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept from other concepts is relevant because the question asks about the length of each episode. The rule that age is a different concept is not relevant because it is not related to the question. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant because it is not related to the question.\nThe answer: 25 minutes", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The BBC produced Doctor Who for 26 seasons.\nThe answer: 26", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1.\" The negation in the question (\"who ended\") indicates that we need to find the subject of the verb \"suspended\", which is \"Jonathan Powell\". Therefore, the relevant rules are 1 (to understand that \"suspended\" means \"ended\"), 8 (to understand that \"ended\" is the antonym of \"suspended\"), and 17 (to understand that negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: Jonathan Powell", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions a documentary called \"Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS\".\nThe answer: Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the series would return", "{rule list: 4, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the programme was broadcast on BBC 1, which is a TV station. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so \"BBC\" is not a profession. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the information about the show being produced by the BBC drama department's serials division. \nThe answer: BBC 1", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: relaunch the show", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Philip Segal", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the network that showed a Doctor Who film, which is a specific piece of information mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: Fox Network", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Doctor Who television film was successful in the UK with 9.1 million viewers.\nThe answer: 9.1 million", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the country where the Doctor Who film was not successful enough to lead to a series. Rule 3 reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the film was successful in the UK but less so in another country. Therefore, we can infer that the film was not successful in the United States. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Doctor Who film was less successful in the United States and did not lead to a series.", "{rule list: names are equally important for the answer, contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer}\nExplanation: The first episode of the new Doctor Who series was \"Rose\".\nThe answer: Rose", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2005", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"No full series was filmed in 2009\", indicating that there was only one year since 2005 when a full series was not filmed.\nThe answer: 2009", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about who the executive producer of Doctor Who is. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps identify that Chris Chibnall is the successor to Steven Moffat as executive producer. \nThe answer: Chris Chibnall", "{3, 4, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that age and color are different concepts (rule 3), profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4), questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph (rule 7), and some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer (rule 12). The answer is \"Christmas Day specials\". \nThe answer: Christmas Day specials", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1963-1989", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of the new series that continues the plot of the original Doctor Who. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the 2005 version of Doctor Who is the answer since it is mentioned first in the sentence. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" which is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: The 2005 version of Doctor Who", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1996", "{3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that a series is set in a different time period with different characters makes it a reboot rather than a plot continuation. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that a series has different characters also makes it a reboot rather than a plot continuation. Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the examples given in the article. Negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for series that are explicitly stated to be reboots. \nThe answer: Battlestar Galactica and Bionic Woman.", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that different concepts (3) such as TV series (4) should be treated separately, and that irrelevant passages (12) should be ignored. Names (13) are equally important for the answer. The answer: Mission Impossible.", "{16, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because the question asks about the timing of the rebroadcast of the first episode. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is also relevant because the question asks for the specific date of the rebroadcast. \nThe answer: November 30, 1963", "{rule list: 10, 11, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the length of the broadcast delay during the first episode of the series. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can ignore the \"ten minutes\" mentioned in the question. Rule 11 states that contractions in the question are also irrelevant, so we can simplify \"the first time\" to \"the first\".

Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms, such as \"most violent\" and \"voted most violent.\" Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer, and the question asks for the show that was \"most violent,\" implying that there were other shows that were less violent. \nThe answer: Doctor Who", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of survey respondents who considered Doctor Who \"very unsuitable\" for family viewing, which is a specific and negated piece of information. Therefore, rules 17 and 18, which state that negations are important for the answer and that negations in the question are important for the answer, are relevant.\nThe answer: 3% of the surveyed audience considered Doctor Who \"very unsuitable\" for family viewing.", "{13, 17, 20}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13), negations are important for the answer (rule 17), and \"he\" refers to male names (rule 20). The journalist who wrote an article defending Doctor Who is Philip Howard.\nThe answer: Philip Howard", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the comparison made by Philip Howard in his defense of Doctor Who. He compared Monopoly to the property market in London, stating that both are fantasies but one is meant to be taken seriously. This comparison was made to argue that the violence in Doctor Who should not be taken as seriously as the violence in other television series. Therefore, we need to apply rule 3 to differentiate between the concepts of Monopoly and the property market in London, and rule 7 to identify the synonym \"comparison\" in the question. \nThe answer: Monopoly", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Times newspaper", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for an image that is associated with Doctor Who. Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from shape, so we can eliminate the possibility of the answer being \"blue.\" Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can infer that \"image\" is synonymous with \"idea\" or \"concept.\" Therefore, the answer is the concept of the TARDIS. \nThe answer: The concept of the TARDIS.", "3, 8, 13, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from color, so the answer should focus on the shape of the TARDIS. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the question asks for a description of the TARDIS, the answer should not use the word \"look\" which implies color. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the answer should include the name \"TARDIS\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer should not describe what the TARDIS is not. \nThe answer: The TARDIS is a police box-shaped time machine.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the TARDIS is a time machine, which falls under the concept of function. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the TARDIS is a blue police box is not relevant to its function. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the TARDIS was conceived by a BBC scriptwriter and that the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to its trademark claim are not relevant to its function.\nThe answer: time machine", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim.\" Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify \"Metropolitan Police Authority\" as an organization rather than a person. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"objection\" in the question. \nThe answer: Metropolitan Police Authority", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: In 2002", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Doctor Who originally ran for 26 seasons from 1963 to 1989, with some notable exceptions in episode length and connected storylines. This information can be directly extracted from the passage without the need for any additional rules.\nThe answer: 26", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to find out the last episode of the original series, which implies that we need to know the chronological order of the episodes. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can use this to determine the order of the episodes. Rule 23 tells us that the verb in a passive sentence is acted upon the subject, so we need to look for a sentence in the passive voice that tells us when the series ended. The sentence \"Doctor Who originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989\" is in the passive voice and tells us that the series ended on December 6, 1989. \nThe answer: December 6, 1989.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 12", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a Time Lord that Doctor Who has fought. The answer is \"The Master.\" This is found in the passage where it states that season 8 was devoted to the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called The Master. Rule 3 applies because \"name\" is a different concept than \"Time Lord.\" Rule 7 applies because \"fought\" is a synonym for \"battled.\" Rule 13 applies because \"The Master\" is a name and is important for the answer. \n\nThe answer: The Master", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Black Guardian Trilogy", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the 2005 revival came after the classic era. The rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, which means that the serial format changed in the 2005 revival. \nThe answer: 2005", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the length of the episode is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that each episode is 45 minutes long, we can infer that the length of the episode including ads is more than 45 minutes. \nThe answer: 60 minutes", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: on Christmas Day", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Journey's End", "{rule list: 3, 7, 10, 11, 16}\nExplanation: We need to find the year in which \"The Eleventh Hour\" played. The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that \"The Eleventh Hour\" played in 2010. We can use rules 3 and 7 to understand that \"played\" is a synonym for \"broadcast\" and that \"Eleventh Hour\" is a title. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant, and rule 11 tells us that contractions in the question are irrelevant. Finally, rule 16 tells us that the year 2010 comes after the year 2008. \nThe answer: 2010", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage mentions different formats of episodes, and we need to compare them to get a total count. Rule 3 applies because size (25-minute, 45-minute, etc.) is a different concept from the total number of episodes. \nThe answer: 826", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that \"826 Doctor Who instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format).\" This means that the most common length of Doctor Who episodes is 25 minutes.\nThe answer: 25 minutes", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that there have been eight Christmas specials, so the answer is 8.\nThe answer: 8", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that there have been eight Christmas specials, with most of them being 60 minutes in duration and one being 72 minutes. Therefore, the longest Christmas special was 72 minutes long.\nThe answer: 72 minutes", "{3, 17, 23}\nExplanation: We need to find out when Doctor Who began being shown in HDTV, which is a specific technical aspect of the show. Therefore, we apply rule 3 to ensure that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and do not confuse us. We also apply rule 17 to pay attention to negations in the question. Finally, we apply rule 23 to understand that technical aspects of the show are relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: 2009", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that many old episodes of Doctor Who featuring the first two Doctors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton, were destroyed or wiped. \nThe answer: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 97 episodes", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"most notably seasons 3, 4, & 5, from which 79 episodes are missing.\" This means that the missing episodes are from seasons 3, 4, and 5.\nThe answer: seasons 3, 4, & 5", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the practice of wiping tapes and destroying \"spare\" film copies had been brought to a stop by 1978. This means that the practice stopped before 1978. \nThe answer: before 1978", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that between about 1964 and 1973, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed, wiped, or suffered from poor storage which led to severe deterioration from broadcast quality. Therefore, during this time period, the most loss of old shows in the BBC archives occurred.\nThe answer: between 1964 and 1973", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: They bought prints for broadcast.", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved.\" This means that fans made the early colour videos of the show.\nThe answer: fans", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The name of the Marco Polo episode is not mentioned in the article, but the exception is made clear that short clips from every story exist with the exception of Marco Polo. Therefore, it can be inferred that the name of the episode is \"Marco Polo\".\nThe answer: Marco Polo", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: This rule states that shape is a different concept from other concepts, including film. Therefore, the shape of the film is irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: 8 mm cine film", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rules indicate that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that names are equally important for the answer. The answer should therefore specify who released the reconstructions, which is the BBC. \nThe answer: the BBC", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the partner of the BBC in reconstructing some episodes of The Invasion. Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as companies and TV shows, cannot be compared. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is: animation studio Cosgrove Hall. \nThe answer: Cosgrove Hall.", "{rule list: 3, 10}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that age is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 10, which states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. The article states that The Invasion was a serial, but it does not provide the year it was originally shown. Therefore, the answer cannot be extracted from the article.\nThe answer: Cannot be determined from the article.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Theta-Sigma", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the release of missing episodes of Doctor Who on DVD, but does not specify a particular series. However, the mention of the reconstruction of missing episodes of The Invasion for a DVD release in November 2006 suggests that this is the series being referred to. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other attributes, so the fact that The Invasion was originally broadcast in 1968 is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so the answer is November 2006. \nThe answer: November 2006.", "{1, 2, 7, 12}\nExplanation: We need to identify the term used to explain a change in the appearance of Doctor Who. Rules 1 and 2 are not relevant here. Rule 7 is relevant because we need to identify a specific term used in the article. Rule 12 is relevant because we can ignore the irrelevant information in the passage. \nThe answer: regeneration", "{2, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the concept of regeneration was introduced to allow for the recasting of the main character, and that the term \"regeneration\" was not initially used until the third on-screen regeneration. Therefore, we can use rule 2 to infer that the term \"regeneration\" was first used during the third on-screen regeneration. We can also use rule 7 to understand that \"renewal\" and \"change of appearance\" were used to describe the process before the term \"regeneration\" was introduced. \nThe answer: The term \"regeneration\" was first used during the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The rule \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because William Hartnell's poor health prompted the introduction of regeneration. The rule \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because poor health is the antonym of good health. \nThe answer: William Hartnell's poor health.", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the term \"regeneration\" was not initially used for the first regeneration, but rather the first Doctor described it as a \"renewal\". Therefore, we need to look for a synonym of \"renewal\" that refers to the first regeneration. \nThe answer: \"renewal\"", "{rule list: 2, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the term \"regeneration\" was not used until the third on-screen regeneration, and that the Second Doctor underwent a \"change of appearance.\" This means that the answer must refer to a term other than \"regeneration.\" Rule 2 applies because \"change of appearance\" is a synonym for \"regeneration.\" Rule 7 applies because the question may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 12 applies because the information about the Second Doctor's regeneration is relevant, but the citation needed at the end of the passage is not. \nThe answer: change of appearance", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes that if A can only do X a certain number of times, then the answer to how many times A can do X is that certain number. Rule 3 applies because it establishes that \"regenerate\" is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: 12 times (for a total of 13 incarnations)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, then they cannot regenerate more than 12 times. Therefore, the answer is 13 incarnations. \nThe answer: 13", "{3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the episode in which the Doctor received a new cycle of regenerations. Rule 3 reminds us that age is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 tells us that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A, and A has less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the Doctor had used up all 12 of his regenerations, so he had none left, making \"no regenerations\" the antonym of \"a new cycle of regenerations.\" Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which is not relevant to this question. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. The answer is \"The Time of the Doctor.\"", "{1, 2, 7, 8, 13}\nExplanation: The rules state that if a fact is established in multiple sources, it is likely to be true (rule 1), and that a fact that is established in a later work can be used to answer a question about an earlier work (rule 2).

Rule 23 clarifies that \"guest-starred\" means the actor played a role in the show. \nThe answer: John Hurt", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer is a specific event, which is likely to have a unique name. Rule 16 helps to identify that the name of the show is likely to be a proper noun. Rule 23 helps to identify that the sentence structure is passive, with \"The Day of the Doctor\" being the object of the preposition \"of\". \nThe answer: The Day of the Doctor", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Michael Jayston portrayed the Valeyard in the 1986 serial \"The Trial of a Time Lord\". This satisfies rules 13 and 16, which state that names are important for the answer and that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Michael Jayston", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Trial of a Time Lord", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the War Doctor was inserted into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, but his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors. Therefore, the War Doctor exists between the Eighth and Ninth Doctors.\nThe answer: Eighth and Ninth Doctors", "{1, 3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is found in the last sentence of the passage, where it is stated that the Eleventh Doctor meets an unknown incarnation of himself, whom he refers to as \"his secret\" and who is subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor. The relevant rules are 1 (to understand the order of the Doctors), 3 (to differentiate between the Doctors), 16 (to understand the order of events in the passage), and 17 (to understand the importance of negations). \nThe answer: the War Doctor", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). The question asks for the episode that featured the return of William Hartnell, so we need to find the episode where he returned. According to the passage, William Hartnell returned in the 1973 episode \"The Three Doctors,\" so that is the answer.\nThe answer: The Three Doctors", "{1, 13, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific Doctor who returned for the \"Children in Need\" show. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A returned, then A had previously appeared in the show. Rule 13 is relevant because names are equally important for the answer. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is important for identifying the specific Doctor. Rule 20 is relevant because it establishes that \"he\" refers to male names. \nThe answer: Peter Davison", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage lists several instances where the Doctor encounters himself in different incarnations. The question specifically asks for the episode where the First Doctor sees himself. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the First Doctor is the earliest incarnation. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"The First Doctor encounters himself in the story The Space Museum\" is in the active voice, so we can rephrase it in the passive voice to get \"The story The Space Museum features the First Doctor encountering himself.\" \nThe answer: The Space Museum", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Names are important for the answer, and negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: \"The Day of the Doctor\"", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 1 to infer that if Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy appeared together in The Sirens of Time, then The Sirens of Time featured Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy. We use rule 16 to determine that the first doctor listed is Peter Davison and the last is Sylvester McCoy. We use rule 23 to understand that the sentence structure is passive, and the subject (The Sirens of Time) is acted upon by the verb (featuring). \nThe answer: Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article mentions that to celebrate the 40th anniversary in 2003, an audio drama titled Zagreus featuring Paul McGann, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Peter Davison was released with additional archive recordings of Jon Pertwee.\nThe answer: Zagreus.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from others is not relevant to this question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps identify which Doctors are being referred to. The answer is: Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer is the two Doctors who appeared together in the audio adventure Project: Lazarus. According to rule 16, first comes before last and last comes after first, so Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy are the two Doctors who appeared in Project: Lazarus. Rule 1 applies because it establishes that the answer should be the opposite of what is stated in the question, so the answer is not \"Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann,\" who appeared together in a different audio drama. \nThe answer: Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"To celebrate the 40th anniversary in 2003, an audio drama titled Zagreus featuring Paul McGann, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Peter Davison was released with additional archive recordings of Jon Pertwee.\" This indicates that the Doctor Who 40th Anniversary show was released in 2003.\nThe answer: 2003", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"The Time of the Doctor\"", "{1, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if the First Doctor is not actually the first incarnation, then there must have been a previous Doctor. Rule 8 is relevant because it establishes that if the First Doctor is not actually the first incarnation, then he must be the most antonym(earliest) incarnation. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the episode where this is brought up must come before subsequent stories where the First Doctor is depicted as the earliest incarnation. \nThe answer: The Brain of Morbius (1976)", "{3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the episode in which the Fifth Doctor was explicitly confirmed. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can ignore the other mentions of Doctors. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"In what episode was it confirmed that the Fifth Doctor was the current incarnation?\" Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can focus on the mention of the Fifth Doctor in Mawdryn Undead. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question is asking for a confirmation, not a hint or suggestion. \nThe answer: Mawdryn Undead.", "{1, 2, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the episode in which the Eleventh Doctor first acknowledges his number. Rule 16 helps to identify that the answer should be a specific episode. Rules 1 and 2 help to identify that the answer should refer to the Eleventh Doctor's number, and that it should be the first time he acknowledges it. \nThe answer: \"The Lodger\"", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the Fifth Doctor is a later incarnation than the First Doctor. Rule 22 is also relevant because it establishes that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, which means that the Fourth Doctor is the former and the Fifth Doctor is the latter. Therefore, the 20th Anniversary special was aired in 1983.\nThe answer: 1983", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). The question is asking for the name of the first Doctor Who serial, which is \"An Unearthly Child\".\nThe answer: An Unearthly Child", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as names are different from concepts such as age or color. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Susan Foreman.", "{1, 2, 7, 10, 12, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and superlatives, which are important for determining the timing of events. Rule 7 is relevant because questions may contain synonyms, and it is important to identify them in order to extract the correct answer. Rules 10 and 12 are relevant because they deal with typos and irrelevant passages, which can be distracting and should be ignored. Rules 17 and 18 are relevant because negations are important for determining the correct answer. Rule 23 is relevant because it deals with active and passive sentences, which can affect the interpretation of the text. \nThe answer: 2005", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: destroyed", "{rule list: 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the episode in which the Doctor acknowledges having had a brother. The relevant rules include:\n1. If A is more X than B, then B is less X than A.\n4. Profession and nationality are different concepts.\n8. If A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A.\n12. Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer.\n16. First comes before last and last comes after first.\n17. Negations are important for the answer.\n18. Negations in the question are important for the answer.\n20. \"He\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names.\n21. \"His\" refer to male names and \"her\" refer to female names.\nUsing these rules, we can infer that the Doctor is male and that he has had a brother in the past, but that he no longer has one. Therefore, we need to look for a negation in the question and a reference to a male character who is not", "{3, 19}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer could be an animal or a vehicle. The rule that \"a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession\" eliminates the possibility that the answer could be a specific gender. Therefore, the answer is \"humanoid\". \nThe answer: humanoid aliens", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"the only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin\" is a clear statement of fact that directly answers the question. Rule 23, which states that in a passive sentence the subject is acted upon the verb, is also relevant as the sentence \"The Deadly Assassin is the only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone\" is in the passive voice.\nThe answer: The Deadly Assassin", "{1, 4, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a family member of the Doctor who traveled with him in the early episodes. Rule 1 applies because it mentions the comparison of two entities. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between profession and family relations. Rule 16 applies because it establishes the order of events. Rule 20 applies because it clarifies the use of pronouns. \nThe answer: his granddaughter Susan Foreman", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the occupation of the companions is not related to their nationality or race. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the Doctor's granddaughter Susan Foreman is not included in the answer. \nThe answer: The article does not provide information about the occupation of Doctor Who's non-related companions.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Romana is a Time Lady is not relevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that Romana is the character mentioned after the list of notable companions. \nThe answer: Romana", "{1, 4, 19, 20}\nExplanation: The gender of the primary traveling companion is being asked, which is a characteristic that is independent of profession or nationality. Therefore, rules 1 and 4 apply to ensure that the question is not misinterpreted. Rule 19 applies to ensure that gender is not conflated with profession. Rule 20 applies to ensure that the correct pronouns are used. \nThe answer: female", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is relevant because it helps us identify the companions as secondary rather than primary characters. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it helps us identify the order in which the companions are listed.\nThe answer: Mickey Smith and Jack Harkness", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first is relevant because it helps us identify which Doctor is being referred to. \nThe answer: The Eleventh Doctor.", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The answer is Bill, played by Pearl Mackie.", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of the actress who played the character named Donna Noble, which is a name mentioned in the context paragraph. Therefore, rule 13 applies. The question uses the pronoun \"who\" to refer to the person who played the character, which implies that the answer should be a person's name. Therefore, rule 20 applies.\nThe answer: Catherine Tate", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is relevant because the question asks for the executive producer's profession, not their nationality. The rule that names are equally important for the answer is also relevant because the question specifically asks for the name of the executive producer. \nThe answer: Russell T Davies", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: series 1", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Cybermen", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists the classic icons of Doctor Who that were reintroduced in each series, and the Master was reintroduced in series 3.\nThe answer: series 3", "{rule list: profession and nationality are different concepts, names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a specific entity that was reintroduced in the 50th Anniversary special. The answer will likely be a name. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. \nThe answer: Zygons", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the oldest villains, implying that there are newer ones. Rule 3 applies because the answer describes the physical characteristics of the Daleks, which are different from their status as villains.\nThe answer: The Dalek race", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro.\" \nThe answer: Skaro", "{1, 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the primary mission of the Daleks, implying that they have other missions as well. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a concept (mission) and not a physical attribute (such as size or shape). Rule 7 applies because the question contains a synonym for \"mission\" (role). \nThe answer: to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings.", "{3, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Daleks were mutated by the scientist Davros. This answer does not require any additional rules beyond those selected.\nThe answer: Davros", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so these are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer can be rephrased as \"What is the main strength of the Daleks' enemies?\" The answer is their eyestalk. \nThe answer: Their eyestalk.", "{1, 4, 13, 19}\nExplanation: The question asks for the archenemy of Doctor Who, which is a profession. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of nationality. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the character's name. The passage mentions \"the Master\" as the Doctor's archenemy, so that is the answer. Rule 1 is relevant because it helps us understand that if the Doctor is the Master's archenemy, then the Master is also the Doctor's archenemy. Rule 19 is relevant because it reminds us that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so we can use \"they\" instead of \"he\" or \"she\" when referring to the Master. \nThe answer: The Master", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article explains that the Doctor and the Master are both Time Lords, which is a concept separate from their profession or nationality.\nThe answer: Time Lord", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Eric Roberts", "{rule list: 2, 13}\nExplanation: The comparison between the Master and Doctor Who is described as \"Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes\", which is a literary reference to the archenemy of Sherlock Holmes. The comparison emphasizes the Master's role as the Doctor's main antagonist. \nThe answer: Professor Moriarty", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the first person to play the role of the Master, which is a specific piece of information that can be found in the passage. Rule 16 helps to determine that the answer should be a person's name, and rule 23 helps to understand that the sentence structure is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject (the role of the Master) is being acted upon (being played by someone). The answer: Roger Delgado.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the actor who played the Master in the 2007 episode \"Utopia\". The sentence \"Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode 'Utopia'\" is in the active voice, meaning that Derek Jacobi played the Master in that episode. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so the first actor mentioned is the one being referred to. Rule 23 states that the subject of an active sentence acts the verb. Therefore, the answer is Derek Jacobi. \nThe answer: Derek Jacobi", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the name of an episode, which is a specific piece of information that can be found in the context. Rule 16 helps to establish the order of events, which is necessary to identify the correct episode. Rule 23 helps to understand the passive voice used in the sentence. \nThe answer: \"Utopia\"", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the year in which the Master reincarnated into a female body. The relevant information is that this happened in the 2014 episode \"Dark Water\". Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"reincarnate\" which is a synonym for \"regenerate\", the process by which Time Lords change their appearance and personality. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the year, and the answer is given in terms of the episode title. \nThe answer: 2014", "{rule list: 3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the nickname of the female Master, which is \"Missy.\" The use of the word \"nickname\" implies that it is not the Master's official name, but rather a colloquial or informal name. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) is relevant to distinguish between the Master's official name and her nickname. Rule 10 (typos in the question are irrelevant) is also relevant because the question contains a minor typo (\"femal\" instead of \"female\"), but it does not affect the answer. Finally, rule 17 (negations are important) is relevant because the question uses the word \"nickname\" which implies a negation of the Master's official name. \nThe answer: Missy", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Michelle Gomez", "{rule list: 1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the composer of the original Doctor Who theme. Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire. Rule 3 applies because the article describes the techniques used to create the music, which were innovative for the time. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the composer, and the article mentions that Ron Grainer composed the original theme. \nThe answer: Ron Grainer", "{rule list: 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts and animals and vehicles being different concepts are not relevant to this question. The passage only mentions the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which is a workshop related to music and sound effects, not a profession or nationality. The passage also does not mention any animals or vehicles. The passage does mention the creation of the Doctor Who theme, which was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills.\nThe answer: the BBC Radiophonic Workshop", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes the use of musique concr\u00e8te techniques, which involve creating tape loops and manipulating recordings to create new sounds. This is a specific technique used to create the theme. Rule 3 applies because \"techniques\" is a different concept from \"musical genre\" or \"instruments.\" Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the specific technique used, which is a more specific aspect of the broader concept of \"creating music.\" \nThe answer: musique concr\u00e8te techniques", "{3, 10, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: season 17 (1979-80)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Did I write that?\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions different arrangements of the Doctor Who theme for various seasons, but only one of them is attributed to a specific person, Peter Howell, for season 18. This information is presented in a chronological order, so the first mention of a specific person recording the theme corresponds to the answer.\nThe answer: Peter Howell", "{rule list: 2, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the creator of the theme used in 1986, which is a specific time period. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a specific person. Rule 2 states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, we know that the theme used in 1986 was created by someone, but we don't know if they were the only one involved in creating it. Rule 17 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: Dominic Glynn", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. \nThe answer: Seventh Doctor", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage lists several composers who created arrangements of the Doctor Who theme for different seasons. The question specifically asks for the composer of the 2005 theme. Rule 16 helps us determine that the 2005 theme came after the Seventh Doctor's era, which ended in 1989. Rule 22 tells us that \"latter\" refers to the last entity listed, which in this case is Murray Gold. \nThe answer: Murray Gold", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Christmas Invasion", "{rule list: names and locations are equally important, first comes before last}\nExplanation: The article mentions several Christmas special episodes, but the specific one mentioned in relation to a new arrangement of the theme is \"Voyage of the Damned\", which aired in 2007.\nThe answer: Voyage of the Damned", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the radio station where the Doctor Who theme charted in 2011, which is a specific piece of information mentioned in the article. Rule 3 applies to clarify that \"theme tune\" refers to the Doctor Who theme. Rule 13 applies to indicate that the name of the radio station is important for the answer. \nThe answer: Classic FM", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the version of the theme that had a negative reception from some viewers. Rule 3 tells us that \"version\" refers to a different concept than \"composer\" or \"series\". Rule 8 tells us that if a version is more liked or disliked than another, then the other version is more antonym(liked/disliked) than the first. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: the revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement.", "{3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The question asks for the chart position of the Doctor Who theme on the radio charts, which is a numerical value. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from others, so we can focus on the specific information about the chart position. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms, so \"chart position\" and \"radio charts\" can be considered equivalent. Finally, Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the details about the different versions of the theme. \nThe answer: 228", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the creator of the theme for the 50th Anniversary special. The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\".

The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" helps us understand that the person who recorded the version with spoken lyrics is not someone who sang the original theme. \nThe answer: Jon Pertwee", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A). The question asks for the name of the group that released a disco version of the Doctor Who theme, which is a profession. Therefore, we can use rule 4 to determine that the answer will be a group name, and rule 8 to determine that the answer will be the opposite of \"released\", which is \"recorded\". \nThe answer: Mankind", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: number 24", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Doctorin' the Tardis\"", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Doctorin' the Tardis\" by The Timelords", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about whether the answer should be a person's name or their nationality.

The answer: Dudley Simpson.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Planet of Giants", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Dudley Simpson contributed to Doctor Who during the first 15 years, which would be the 1960s and 1970s. \nThe answer: 1960s and 1970s", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We can use rule 3 to determine that \"last\" refers to the final episode that Dudley Simpson wrote music for. We can use rule 16 to determine that the last episode refers to \"The Horns of Nimon\". \nThe answer: The Horns of Nimon.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Dudley Simpson made a cameo appearance as a music hall conductor in The Talons of Weng-Chiang.\nThe answer: The Talons of Weng-Chiang.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the music was performed is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that Murray Gold and Ben Foster have performed all the Doctor Who music since the 2005 Christmas special.\nThe answer: Murray Gold and Ben Foster", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions a concert that took place to raise money for Children in Need, and it was hosted by David Tennant. Murray Gold and Russell T Davies also answered questions during the interval. This indicates that the performers were Murray Gold and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, and the event was hosted by David Tennant.\nThe answer: Murray Gold and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a specific event mentioned in the article. Rule 3 is relevant to ensure that the concept of \"Doctor Who Prom\" is not confused with other concepts mentioned in the article.

Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about the incidental music, which is a different concept than the main theme or other aspects of the show's music. Rule 13 applies because the question asks about a specific person or group of people. \nThe answer: Murray Gold and Ben Foster", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of soundtracks is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can count the number of soundtracks mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: six", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The first soundtrack featured tracks from the first two series, so the answer is series 1 and 2.\nThe answer: series 1 and 2", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: music from the 2008-2010 specials (The Next Doctor to End of Time Part 2)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"A Christmas Carol\"", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: We can use rule 16 to determine that the order of the soundtrack releases is chronological.

The relevant rule is that \"shape\" is a different concept from \"color\". The answer is \"The logo for the Twelfth Doctor\".", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a specific logo that is used for merchandise featuring past Doctors. Rule 3 states that color is a different concept, so any mention of color in the passage can be ignored. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any specific Doctor names mentioned in the passage. The passage states that \"the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors is the primary logo used on all media and merchandise relating to past Doctors,\" so the answer is the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors. \n\nThe answer: the logo used for the Third and Eighth Doctors", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The logo from 1973\u201380 was used for the Third Doctor's final season and for the majority of the Fourth Doctor's tenure.\"\nThe answer: the logo from 1973-80", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions the First and Second Doctors before discussing the Eleventh Doctor's use of the original logo. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the Doctor who was current during the 50th Anniversary special, which took place during the Eleventh Doctor's run. \nThe answer: Eleventh Doctor", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the assassination of John F. Kennedy", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: BBC's mainstream BBC One channel", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the show had three notable periods of high ratings, with the second being in the late 1970s when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million. This means that the show saw audiences as high as 12 million in the late 1970s.\nThe answer: late 1970s", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The \"Dalekmania\" period was a time when the popularity of the Daleks brought Doctor Who high ratings, even for stories that did not feature them. This implies that the Daleks were a major factor in the show's success during this period. The question asks for the time period of \"Dalekmania,\" which is a specific term used in the article. Therefore, rules 2 and 8 are relevant, as they deal with comparisons and antonyms. The answer is circa 1964-1965.\nThe answer: circa 1964-1965", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: BBC Three", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Doctor Who's viewership peaked during the ITV network strike of 1979, with a viewership of 16 million. \nThe answer: During the ITV network strike of 1979.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the BBC Board of Control considered the show's \"late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers\" to be a leading cause of its suspension in 1989. The use of the word \"leading\" indicates that there may have been other contributing factors as well. The rules used are 3 (to distinguish between different concepts), 8 (to understand the comparison between viewership numbers), and 17 (to take into account the negation in the question). \nThe answer: Poor viewership levels", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 7 (synonyms), and 17 (negations). The question asks for the show that competed with the program in the late 80s, implying that the program had poor viewership during that time. The passage mentions that the program was scheduled against the soap opera Coronation Street, which was the most popular show at the time. Therefore, the answer is Coronation Street.\nThe answer: Coronation Street", "{rule list: 3, 8, 10, 11, 17}\nExplanation: Coronation Street's popularity is being asked about in the late 80's. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so popularity cannot be compared to any of these. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article mentions that Doctor Who's performance was poor, it does not necessarily mean that Coronation Street was popular. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so the typo in \"80's\" does not affect the answer. Rule 11 states that contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so \"Coronation Street's\" can be replaced with \"the soap opera Coronation Street\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that the article does not mention that Coronation Street was unpopular means that it cannot be assumed that it was. \nThe answer: unknown/not mentioned", "{rule list: 3, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the timing of the third period of high viewership for the Doctor Who series. The passage mentions that the series was off the air for 18 months in 1985, and its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time. This implies that the third period of high viewership must have occurred after the late 1980s. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from size, shape, color, and profession, so we can't use the age of the series to determine the timing. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the third period of high viewership was not poor. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the parts about the ITV network strike and the BBC Board of Control. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the suspension of the program in 198", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the question asks for the station where the 20th anniversary special premiered before being shown on BBC, indicating that the premiere showing on the other station came before the BBC showing.\nThe answer: PBS stations", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the 1988 story Silver Nemesis was broadcast with all three episodes airing back to back on TVNZ in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Therefore, New Zealand showed all three episodes of Silver Nemesis before the BBC did.\nThe answer: New Zealand", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the location where the 1996 television film premiered. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer. Rule 13 states that names and locations are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Edmonton, Canada", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the number of days that the 1996 television film premiered ahead of the BBC showing. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the premiere on CITV in Edmonton, Canada, which was 15 days before the BBC One showing, is the relevant event. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, and since there is no negation in the question, we simply output the number of days: 15. \nThe answer: 15", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The 1983 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors had its d\u00e9but on 23 November (the actual date of the anniversary) on a number of PBS stations two days prior to its BBC One broadcast.\"\nThe answer: November 23, 1983.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the Australian TV station that has exclusively first run Doctor Who since January 1965. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name of the TV station. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first TV station mentioned in the article is the one that has run Doctor Who since 1965. \nThe answer: Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: partial funding", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the station that started showing Doctor Who after the SF channel closed. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse concepts such as professions and colors, which is not relevant here. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, which is also not relevant here. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because we need to identify the station that started showing Doctor Who after the SF channel closed. The answer is SyFy. \n\nThe answer: SyFy", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: ABC screened all available classic episodes weekly for the show's 40th anniversary.\nThe answer: screened all available classic episodes weekly for the show's 40th anniversary.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, rule 4, which states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, is relevant because it clarifies that the show Doctor Who is not a person or profession. Rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, is also relevant because it allows us to understand that \"repeats\" are not the same as \"first run.\" \nThe answer: ABC1", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that TVOntario began airing Doctor Who in 1976 and continued to air each series through to series 24 in 1991. \nThe answer: 1976", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Three Doctors", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that CBC began showing the series again in 2005 and then the series moved to the Canadian cable channel Space in 2009.\nThe answer: Space", "{rule list: 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Its airing of The Talons of Weng-Chiang was cancelled as a result of accusations that the story was racist.\" This means that the show that was cancelled was The Talons of Weng-Chiang.\nThe answer: The Talons of Weng-Chiang", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a person who introduced Doctor Who episodes on TVOntario. This falls under rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 4 also applies, as it clarifies that profession and nationality are different concepts, meaning that the fact that Judith Merril was a science fiction writer is not irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Judith Merril", "{13, 20}\nExplanation: The article states that Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode, including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest, for the Canadian broadcast of Doctor Who.\nThe answer: Christopher Eccleston", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that excerpts from the documentary \"Doctor Who Confidential\" were played over the closing credits.\nThe answer: excerpts from the documentary \"Doctor Who Confidential\"", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Billie Piper recorded a special video introduction for \"The Christmas Invasion\"\nThe answer: \"The Christmas Invasion\"", "{16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that CBC began airing series two on October 9, 2006.\nThe answer: October 9, 2006", "{3, 10, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that series two began airing on Thanksgiving in most of the country. \nThe answer: Thanksgiving", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the availability of Doctor Who DVDs in different countries, which is a matter of distribution and not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are relevant. The answer is: United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United States.", "{rule list: 5, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Laserdisc is a type of video format, which falls under the concept of \"media format\" and is different from the concept of \"serials\" or \"shows\". Therefore, rule 5 applies. The passage only mentions that \"eight original series serials have been released on Laserdisc\", which means that only a specific subset of the Doctor Who series was released on Laserdisc. This information is not relevant to the question, so rule 12 applies. The question asks for a list of shows released on Laserdisc, but the passage only provides a number, not a list. Therefore, rule 16 applies.\nThe answer: eight original series serials", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Infinite Quest", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Spearhead from Space", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"age is a different concept\" means that the years of the series are not the same as the format they are available on. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because the question asks for the years that are available on Blu-ray, and the rule implies that the years that are not available on Blu-ray are more \"not available on Blu-ray\" than the years that are available. Therefore, the answer is: \"Only the series from 2009 onwards are available on Blu-ray.\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the first person mentioned in the passage played the role in the 70's. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb\", which means that the sentence \"Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday\" is in the active voice, and Trevor Martin is the subject who played the role.\nThe answer: Trevor Martin", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be confused with profession or nationality. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that The Curse of the Daleks was written before Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we know that The Curse of the Daleks was written without the Doctor. \nThe answer: The Curse of the Daleks.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the name of a play that was performed in the 1970s. The passage mentions that Trevor Martin played the role of the Doctor in a play called \"Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday\" during the early 1970s.\nThe answer: Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that in the sentence \"Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who \u2013 The Ultimate Adventure\", Jon Pertwee played the Doctor before Colin Baker. The rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that in the sentence \"David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor\", David Banks is the subject and played is the verb, indicating that he acted as the Doctor. Therefore, David Banks was a replacement for Doctor Who due to the illness of Jon Pertwee. \nThe answer: David Banks", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Torchwood", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006.\" Rule 16 helps us understand that \"debuted\" means \"premiered.\" Rule 22 helps us understand that \"former\" refers to Doctor Who and \"latter\" refers to Torchwood.\nThe answer: 22 October 2006", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage provides a chronological order of the Torchwood series, with the second series airing after the first and before the third. Rule 16 helps to determine that the second series came after the first, and rule 23 helps to understand that \"aired\" means the series was broadcasted. \nThe answer: 2008", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Children of Earth", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions four different series of Torchwood, and the question asks for the name of the one that was mostly based in the US. Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as location and name, cannot be confused. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last,\" so we can infer that the fourth series mentioned in the passage is the last one. Therefore, the answer is Torchwood: Miracle Day. \nThe answer: Torchwood: Miracle Day", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of the person who starred in The Sarah Jane Adventures. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 20 states that \"she\" refers to female names. \nThe answer: Elisabeth Sladen", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific date, which can be found in the article as \"24 September 2007\". Rule 16 helps to identify that this date comes after the New Year's Day special in 2007.

Therefore, rules 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), 20 (he refers to male names and she refers to female names), and 21 (his refers to male names and her refers to female names) are relevant. \nThe answer: Joanna Lumley.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: head writer and executive producer", "{rule list} \n1.

Therefore, we need to focus on the rule that pop culture references are relevant to the answer. Additionally, we need to consider the rule that synonyms for \"reference\" are relevant to the answer. Finally, we need to differentiate between TV shows and video games, as the question specifically mentions a TV show. \nThe answer: \"The Neutral Zone\"", "{7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for specific episodes of Family Guy that contain Doctor Who references.

Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession, so awards are not related to countries or people. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"recognized\" can be replaced with \"awarded.\" \nThe answer: Mind Award", "{1, 8, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 1 to infer that if Doctor Who has won the Hugo award six times, then it has also won it more times than the years it did not win it (3). We use rule 8 to infer that if Doctor Who has won the Hugo award more times than the years it did not win it (3), then it has won it less times than the total number of years (10) minus the years it did not win it (3). Therefore, Doctor Who has won the Hugo award 7 times. \nThe answer: 7", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Doctor Who has been nominated for over 200 awards and has won over a hundred of them.\" This means that Doctor Who has been nominated for more than 200 awards. \nThe answer: over 200", "{3, 8, 13}\nExplanation: We need to extract the number of awards won by Doctor Who. Rule 3 tells us that \"number\" is a different concept from \"name\", so we can safely extract the number without worrying about any potential confusion with other concepts. Rule 8 tells us that if A has won more awards than B, then B has won more antonym(awards) than A, and A has won less antonym(awards) than B. This helps us understand that the answer will be a number greater than 100, since the article states that Doctor Who has won over 100 awards. Finally, Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to make sure we extract the correct name of the award. \nThe answer: Doctor Who has won over 100 awards.", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is relevant because it allows us to identify \"Doctor Who star Matt Smith\" as the actor in question, rather than just \"Matt Smith.\" The rule that \"he\" refers to male names is also relevant because it confirms that the actor is male. \nThe answer: Matt Smith", "{rule list: 1, 2, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the specific Doctor Who episode that won a Hugo Award in 2010. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if one episode won in 2010, then the others did not. Rule 2 is relevant because it establishes that the winning episode is the most X, while the others are less X. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms in the question. Rule 13 is relevant because it establishes that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: \"The Waters of Mars\"", "{rule list: 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a comedian who did a parody involving a Dalek. The answer is Spike Milligan, who had a Dalek invade his bathroom and threw a soap sponge at it. This is a direct answer found in the passage. Rules 3, 7, and 13 are relevant because they help to identify the specific comedian and parody mentioned in the passage, without being misled by other irrelevant information. \nThe answer: Spike Milligan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jon Culshaw", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: Spike Milligan throws a soap sponge at the Dalek, which is a type of improvised weapon.\nThe answer: soap sponge", "{rule list: 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a person or entity that is parodied on certain TV programs. The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph), and 13 (names are equally important for the answer). The answer is Doctor Who. \nThe answer: Doctor Who", "{rule list: 4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. In this case, the question refers to an actor doing an impression of the Fourth Doctor, which is a profession. Therefore, we can use rule 4 to infer that the gender of the actor is irrelevant to the answer, and we can use rule 20 to infer that the Fourth Doctor is a male character. \nThe answer: Dead Ringers", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" and \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts,\" so the answer cannot be related to these concepts. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is also irrelevant. Therefore, the most relevant rules are that \"the type of entity is important for the answer\" and \"a person's profession is irrelevant to their gender.\" The answer is: a private research university.", "{rule list: first comes before last and last comes after first}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The university, established in 1890...\".\nThe answer: 1890", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists several professional schools within the University of Chicago. We can count them to determine the answer.\nThe answer: seven", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the University of Chicago consists of \"various graduate programs, interdisciplinary committees organized into four academic research divisions and seven professional schools.\" Therefore, the answer is 4.\nThe answer: 4", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the question asks for the number of students enrolled at the University of Chicago, which is a specific detail mentioned at the end of the article.\nThe answer: Approximately 15,000 students overall.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks about a development that University of Chicago scholars played a major role in. The answer mentions several academic disciplines that were developed with the help of these scholars, including economics, sociology, literary criticism, religion, and political science. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 6 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so it is relevant to note that the scholars in question are from the University of Chicago. \nThe answer: the development of various academic disciplines", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university's Stagg Field.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that the subject (Chicago's physics department) is being acted upon (helped develop) by the verb (develop). Therefore, we need to use rules 16 and 23 to determine that the subject is the physics department and the answer is \"Chicago's physics department.\" \nThe answer: Chicago's physics department", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university's Stagg Field\" is in the active voice, meaning that the subject (Chicago's physics department) acted upon the verb (helped develop). Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that the location of the nuclear reaction is beneath the university's Stagg Field. Additionally, we can use rule 23 to understand that the sentence is referring to the location of the nuclear reaction in the past tense.\nThe answer: beneath the university's Stagg Field", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The passage mentions the University of Chicago Press as the largest university press in the United States. Therefore, the answer is: University of Chicago Press.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the context, which states that the estimated completion date of the Barack Obama Presidential Center is 2020.\nThe answer: 2020", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that names are equally important for the answer is also not relevant. The relevant rules are that organizations and institutions are different concepts (3) and that names are equally important for the answer (14). The answer is: American Baptist Education Society.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: John D. Rockefeller", "{16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the first president of the University of Chicago was William Rainey Harper. Rule 13 states that \"names are equally important for the answer\", which means that the answer should include the name \"William Rainey Harper\".\nThe answer: William Rainey Harper", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1891", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article states that William Rainey Harper became the university's first president in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892. Therefore, the answer is 1892.\nThe answer: 1892", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the University of Chicago was created on land donated by Marshall Field. \nThe answer: Marshall Field.", "{3, 16, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who provided the funds for the campus' first building.\nThe answer: Silas B. Cobb", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage mentions that Silas B. Cobb provided the funds for the campus' first building, which was Cobb Lecture Hall. \nThe answer: Cobb Lecture Hall", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: funds for the campus' first building", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the name of the donor is not relevant for the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name of the donor who helped establish the Hutchinson Commons.\nThe answer: Charles L. Hutchinson.", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about who the University of Chicago affiliated with in the 1890s. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any mention of professions or jobs is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"With which schools did the University of Chicago affiliate in the 1890s?\" The answer: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, Stetson University, and Shimer College.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois.\" This is a straightforward answer that can be found by identifying the year mentioned and the name of the college. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which helps to identify that the year 1896 comes before the mention of the other colleges and universities. Rule 23 is relevant because it explains that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, which helps to identify that the University of Chicago is the subject of the sentence and that it is the one doing the affiliating. \nThe answer: 1896", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago.\nThe answer: Made a grade of A for all four years or took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago.", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Several University of Chicago professors", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1910", "{rule list: 16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the fifth president mentioned in the passage is the answer to the question. Rule 13 states that \"names are equally important for the answer\", which means that we need to identify the name of the fifth president.\nThe answer: Robert Maynard Hutchins", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Hutchins instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core. \nThe answer: Common Core", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the sentence states that Hutchins wanted to emphasize academics over athletics. Rule 3 applies because football is a sport, which is a different concept than academics. Rule 4 applies because the decision to eliminate football was made by the university's president, which is a profession and a different concept than the sport of football. \nThe answer: To emphasize academics over athletics.", "{16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Robert Maynard Hutchins was the university's fifth president and that he served for 24 years.\nThe answer: 24 years", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article states that Robert Maynard Hutchins was the university's fifth president, so he came after the first four presidents. Therefore, the year he took office would be after the years that the first four presidents took office.\nThe answer: 1929", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In the early 1950s, student applications declined.\" This indicates that the drop in applications occurred in the early 1950s.\nThe answer: early 1950s", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood.\" The use of the word \"result\" indicates a cause and effect relationship, which is a form of negation. Therefore, we need to apply rules 3 and 17, which state that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.\" This means that Shimer College students were allowed to transfer to the University of Chicago after their second year.\nThe answer: after their second year", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the university sponsored an urban renewal project for Hyde Park in response to increasing crime and poverty. This implies that the project was intended to help the residents of Hyde Park.\nThe answer: Hyde Park", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: allowed very young students to attend college", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that students occupied President George Beadle's office in 1962, which means that the occupation happened before any other events mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: 1962", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the university's off-campus rental policies", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The Kalven Report was issued in response to student unrest during the 1960s.\nThe answer: 1967", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is the most relevant here, as it tells us that the Kalven Report was issued after the student unrest in the 1960s. Therefore, we can assume that the report was issued after 1962 and before the end of the decade. The answer is not explicitly stated in the article, but we can infer from the context that the report was only two pages long.\nThe answer: two pages", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Kalven Report as a statement of the university's policy in \"social and political action.\" Rule 3 reminds us that different concepts, such as policies and reports, cannot be confused. Rule 12 tells us to ignore irrelevant information, such as the student unrest of the 1960s. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to look for what the report actually said. \nThe answer: The Kalven Report declared that \"To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures.\"", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the university began expansion projects from the mid-2000s and goes on to describe specific projects and donations in 2008, 2009, and 2014. Therefore, we can infer that the decision to start multimillion-dollar expansion projects was made in the mid-2000s.\nThe answer: mid-2000s", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Milton Friedman Institute", "{1, 10, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if the article states that the Milton Friedman Institute cost around $200 million, then it can be inferred that it roughly cost $200 million. Rule 10 is relevant because it states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so any minor differences in phrasing or capitalization do not affect the answer. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed, which in this case is the Chicago Theological Seminary, and \"latter\" refers to the University of Chicago. \n\nThe answer: Around $200 million.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rule is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The passage mentions that the Milton Friedman Institute will occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary, which refers to the physical location of the institute and not the specific buildings themselves. Therefore, the size, shape, or age of the buildings is not relevant to the answer. The relevant rule is also rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer. The answer is: the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: David G. Booth", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the first buildings that make up the Main Quadrangles of the University of Chicago campus. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can assume that the first buildings mentioned in the passage are the ones being referred to. Therefore, the answer is: the Main Quadrangles.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Main Quadrangles consist of six quadrangles, each surrounded by buildings, bordering one larger quadrangle. Therefore, the answer is 6.\nThe answer: 6", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Henry Ives Cobb, Cobb, Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, Holabird & Roche, and other architectural firms", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Mitchell Tower is modeled after Oxford's Magdalen Tower, which means that the design of the Mitchell Tower is based on the design of the Magdalen Tower at Oxford. \nThe answer: Magdalen Tower", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Hutchinson Hall was designed in the Collegiate Gothic style, patterned on the colleges of the University of Oxford, specifically replicating Christ Church Hall.\nThe answer: Christ Church Hall", "{1, 3, 12}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the passage, which states that \"After the 1940s, the Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles.\" Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that \"after the 1940s\" means that the change to modern styles happened later than the 1940s. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of style and physical appearance. Rule 12 is relevant because it allows us to ignore the details about specific buildings and focus on the overall change in style. \nThe answer: 1940s", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1955, Eero Saarinen was contracted to develop a second master plan for the campus.\nThe answer: Eero Saarinen", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: School of Social Service Administration", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed the building is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that the building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is the School of Social Service Administration. \nThe answer: School of Social Service Administration", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists a series of buildings constructed on campus, and the question asks specifically about the construction date of one of them. Therefore, rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) are relevant. \nThe answer: 2003.", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is also not relevant as no names are mentioned in the article. The relevant rule is that \"locations are equally important for the answer.\" The answer is: Singapore, London, and the downtown Streeterville neighborhood of Chicago.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of the Center in Paris, which is mentioned in the context paragraph. Rule 13 states that locations are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the specific location mentioned. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the Center in Paris is the first facility mentioned. \nThe answer: Seine", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the most recent addition to the University of Chicago's centers, which is the center in Hong Kong that opened in 2015. Therefore, the center in Beijing must have been established before 2015. The passage also states that the center in Beijing was opened in fall 2010, making that the answer.\nThe answer: 2010", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is relevant because it helps us understand that the question is asking about a school's campus, not a person's campus. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is also relevant because it tells us that the name of the school is important for answering the question.\nThe answer: Renmin University", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the most recent addition to the University of Chicago's centers, which is the center in Hong Kong. The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the center in Hong Kong is the last addition mentioned in the article. Rule 23 states that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, which means that the sentence \"a center in Hong Kong which opened in 2015\" is in passive voice and the opening of the center is the action being done to the subject. Therefore, the answer is: 2015.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The University of Chicago is governed by a board of trustees, which oversees the long-term development and plans of the university. Directly beneath the board of trustees is the university President, currently Robert Zimmer. \nThe answer: Robert Zimmer", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). The question asks for the number of people on the Board of Trustees, which is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we need to look for a sentence that mentions the Board of Trustees and provides a number. The sentence \"The Board of Trustees oversees the long-term development and plans of the university and manages fundraising efforts, and is composed of 50 members including the university President\" fits this criteria. \nThe answer: 50", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the number of Vice Presidents is a different concept from the other positions listed. We use rule 16 to determine that the number of Vice Presidents comes after the mention of the Provost. \nThe answer: 14", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"As of August 2009[update], the Chairman of the Board of Trustees is Andrew Alper.\" This means that Andrew Alper was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees at some point in time, specifically in August 2009. \nThe answer: Andrew Alper", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify who replaced Eric Isaacs as Provost in 2016. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Daniel Diermeier is the person who replaced Isaacs. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can ignore the passive voice in \"Isaacs was replaced\" and focus on the subject \"Daniel Diermeier\". \nThe answer: Daniel Diermeier", "{rule list: 17}\nExplanation: Negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: The Higher Learning Commission.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the academic bodies of the University of Chicago consist of the College, four divisions of graduate research, and seven professional schools. \nThe answer: Four", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts tells us that \"professional schools\" are not the same as \"divisions of graduate research\" or \"academic institutions.\" The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" tells us that the number of professional schools should come after the number of graduate divisions. \nThe answer: Seven.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the College of the University of Chicago grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 50 academic majors and 28 minors. \nThe answer: 50", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the College of the University of Chicago grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 50 academic majors and 28 minors. This means that the university grants a total of 28 academic minors.\nThe answer: 28", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the academics of the university are divided into five divisions.\nThe answer: 5", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"categories such as profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates rule 4, and the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates rule 3. The answer to the question is found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the New Collegiate Division \"administers interdisciplinary majors and studies which do not fit in one of the other four divisions.\" This means that the New Collegiate Division offers more than one branch of studies that don't fit in with the other four divisions. \nThe answer: New Collegiate Division", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that undergraduate students are required to take a distribution of courses to satisfy the university's core curriculum known as the Common Core.\nThe answer: Common Core", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that in 2012-2013, the Core classes at Chicago were limited to 17 students, so the answer is 17.\nThe answer: 17", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is comparing UChicago's learning experience to other universities, so we need to use rules 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A) to understand that \"rigorous, intense learning experience\" is the opposite of \"easy, relaxed learning experience.\" We also need to use rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) to understand that \"can most convincingly claim\" means that UChicago claims to have the opposite of an easy, relaxed learning experience. \nThe answer: UChicago claims to provide the most rigorous, intense learning experience.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that undergraduate courses at the University of Chicago are known for their demanding standards, heavy workload, and academic difficulty. This information is directly stated in the passage and does not require any inference or interpretation.\nThe answer: Uni in the USA", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question specifically asks for the name of the school. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: University of Chicago Laboratory Schools", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the name of a specific program. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by identifying the relevant information in the passage, which states that the university operates \"four public charter schools on the South Side of Chicago.\" \nThe answer: four.", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The Urban Education Institute is administered by the University of Chicago and helps run four public charter schools on the South Side of Chicago. \nThe answer: Four public charter schools on the South Side of Chicago", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: on the University of Chicago campus", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that the University of Chicago Library system encompasses six libraries, so the answer is 6.\nThe answer: 6", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The University of Chicago Library system contains a total of 9.8 million volumes, as stated in the article.\nThe answer: 9.8 million", "{rule list: 16, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that the first library mentioned in the article is the main library. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Regenstein Library", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Joe and Rika Mansueto Library was \"built in 2011.\" \nThe answer: 2011", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept from others means that the size of the John Crerar Library's collection is relevant to the answer. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" means that the John Crerar Library should be mentioned before its collection size.\nThe answer: more than 1.3 million volumes", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the university operates 12 research institutes on campus.\nThe answer: 12", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that the university operates 113 research centers on campus. We use rule 3 to differentiate between the Oriental Institute and the National Resource Centers, and rule 13 to prioritize the number of research centers as the most important information.\nThe answer: 113", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question specifically asks for the name of the museum and research center.

Rule 23 applies because the sentence is in the active voice, with Kublai Khan as the subject who performed the action of establishing the Great Yuan. \nThe answer: 1271", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"Great is Qi\u00e1n, the Primal\" is a comparison between Qi\u00e1n and something else, implying that Qi\u00e1n is greater than that something else. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the specific writing that inspired the name, which is a different concept than the name itself. Rule 13 applies because the name \"Great Yuan\" is the answer, and it is a name mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: \"\u5927\u54c9\u4e7e\u5143\" (d\u00e0 zai Qi\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n / \"Great is Qi\u00e1n, the Primal\") in the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes (I Ching) section regarding Qi\u00e1n (\u4e7e)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The article states that the Yuan dynasty was called \"Dai \u00d6n Ulus\" in Mongolian, which is also rendered as \"Ikh Yuan \u00dcls\" or \"Yekhe Yuan Ulus.\" \nThe answer: Dai \u00d6n Ulus", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Yeke Mongghul Ulus is a term in Mongolian language that is mentioned in the passage. Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as language and meaning, are distinct. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Great Yuan Great Mongol State", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 4) is not relevant to this question. The passage mentions that Yuan emperors held a nominal title, which is a type of name (rule 13). Therefore, the relevant rule is that names are equally important for the answer (rule 13). \nThe answer: Great Khan", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: The rules eliminate any irrelevant information about professions, gender, and concepts. The answer is: Genghis Khan united the Mongol and Turkic tribes of the steppes.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a specific time when Genghis Khan became Great Khan, which is a fact that can be found in the article. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the information about Genghis Khan becoming Great Khan should be mentioned before any other events or people in the article. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The answer will likely be in the form of an active sentence. \nThe answer: Genghis Khan became Great Khan in 1206.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Genghis Khan had multiple sons, but the passage specifically mentions his third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The question asks for the name of this son.\nThe answer: \u00d6gedei Khan", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, Mongke Khan succeeded G\u00fcy\u00fck as Great Khan, so he came after G\u00fcy\u00fck. Therefore, Mongke Khan became Great Khan after G\u00fcy\u00fck.\nThe answer: 1251", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Kublai Khan was the nephew of \u00d6gedei Khan, who was Genghis Khan's third son and successor as Great Khan. Therefore, the answer is that Kublai Khan was \u00d6gedei Khan's nephew.\nThe answer: nephew", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the group that the Han Chinese wanted to help fight, which implies that there was some opposition or enemy that they were fighting against. Rule 1 applies because the question uses the word \"help\" which implies that the Mongols were the ones leading the fight. Rule 8 applies because the question uses the word \"want\" which implies that the Han Chinese had a preference or desire to fight alongside the Mongols. \nThe answer: the Jin", "{rule list: 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific Khitan leader who defected to the Mongols. Rule 4 reminds us that nationality and personal identity are different concepts, so we need to look for a name rather than just a nationality. Rule 16 tells us that the first entity listed is referred to as \"former\" and the last as \"latter\", so we know that the Khitan leader's name will come after the two Han Chinese leaders. Rule 23 reminds us that passive voice can be used, so we need to look for a sentence where the Khitan leader is the subject of the verb \"defected\". \nThe answer: Xiao Zhala", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Two Han Chinese leaders, Shi Tianze, Liu Heima (\u5289\u9ed1\u99ac, Liu Ni), and the Khitan Xiao Zhala (\u856d\u672d\u524c) defected and commanded the 3 Tumens in the Mongol army.\" This is a passive sentence, so we need to reverse the order to get the subject first. Therefore, the answer is Liu Heima.\nThe answer: Liu Heima", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from profession and nationality, so rule 4 is not relevant. Animals and vehicles are also not relevant. The passage explicitly states that each Tumen consisted of 10,000 troops, so rule 3 and 16 apply.\nThe answer: 10,000", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer is a specific number of Khitan Tumens.\nThe answer: 3", "{1, 4, 19, 20, 21}\nExplanation: Shi Tianze's ethnicity is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it is mentioned that he was a Han Chinese, which is a nationality. Therefore, we can use rules 4 and 19 to determine that his ethnicity is not relevant to the answer. Additionally, rules 20 and 21 tell us that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can infer that Shi Tianze is male. The answer: Han Chinese.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Shi Tianze lived in the Jin dynasty.\nThe answer: Jin dynasty", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Interethnic marriage between Han and Jurchen became common in the Jin dynasty.\nThe answer: Interethnic marriage between Han and Jurchen.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates concepts such as age and nationality, making it clear that they are not interchangeable. Rule 16 establishes that the order of first and last names is important. Rule 23 clarifies that passive voice is used in the sentence \"Shi Tianze defected to Mongol forces upon their invasion of the Jin dynasty.\" \nThe answer: Shi Bingzhi", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Song dynasty", "{rule list: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that M\u00f6ngke Khan led a military campaign against the Chinese Song dynasty in southern China. \nThe answer: M\u00f6ngke Khan.", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the Mongol force that invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the Middle East in 1256, implying that the Song dynasty was less prepared for the invasion than the Middle East. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a location, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 13 applies because the answer requires a specific name. \nThe answer: southern China", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Mongke Khan died in 1259.\nThe answer: 1259", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Ariq B\u00f6ke challenged Kublai Khan's right to succeed Mongke Khan.\nThe answer: Ariq B\u00f6ke", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by identifying the sentence \"He bolstered his popularity among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting the Chinese era name of Zhongtong.\" This sentence indicates that Kublai adopted the Chinese era name of Zhongtong.\nThe answer: Zhongtong", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Ogedei's grandson Kaidu\" is in the active voice, with \"Ogedei\" as the subject and \"grandson\" as the object. To answer the question, we need to identify who Ogedei is. This requires understanding that \"Ogedei's grandson\" means Kaidu is the grandson of Ogedei. Therefore, Ogedei is Kaidu's grandfather.\nThe answer: Ogedei", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south.\nThe answer: the south", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Kublai installed the prince Wonjong as the ruler of Korea, which means that Wonjong became the ruler of Korea under Kublai's authority. Therefore, we need to use rule 4 to differentiate between profession and nationality, and rule 16 to determine that \"Kublai\" comes before \"Wonjong\" in the timeline. \nThe answer: Wonjong", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of the border between Korea and Kublai's territory. Rule 3 states that location is a different concept from other concepts like age and profession. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the location of Korea should come before the location of Kublai's territory. \nThe answer: northeast border", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The passage states that Li Tan led a revolt against Mongol rule in 1262.\nThe answer: 1262", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding that Kublai's government had to balance preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects. This involves recognizing that \"Mongol interests\" and \"Chinese demands\" are different concepts (rule 4) and that they are in opposition to each other, requiring a balance (rule 3). Additionally, the use of the word \"balance\" implies a comparison between two opposing forces (rule 8).\nThe answer: preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The answer to the question is \"the local administrative structure of past Chinese dynasties.\" Therefore, Kublai left the administrative structure unmodified.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the Han Chinese occupied the lowest rank, then they would have been the least privileged class. \nThe answer: Han Chinese", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Kublai rejected plans to revive the Confucian imperial examinations and divided Yuan society into three, later four, classes with the Han Chinese occupying the lowest rank. \nThe answer: four", "{3, 4, 5, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Kublai maintained the traditional monopolies on salt and iron. This means that the Chinese government had a monopoly on these natural resources.\nThe answer: salt and iron", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kublai readied the move of the Mongol capital from Karakorum in Mongolia to Khanbaliq in 1264, indicating that the capital was previously located in Karakorum.\nThe answer: Karakorum", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the location where the capital was moved to, which is a comparison between two different places. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves a location. Rule 13 applies because the name of the location is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Khanbaliq (or modern Beijing)", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 1 to infer that if Kublai readied the move in 1264, then the move happened after that year. We use rule 16 to understand that \"move\" refers to the relocation of the Mongol capital. \nThe answer: 1266", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kublai constructed a new city near the former Jurchen capital Zhongdu, which is now modern Beijing. This means that Zhongdu is the former name of Beijing, so we need to use rule 16 to determine that the answer is Beijing.\nThe answer: Zhongdu", "{rule list: 4, 20, 21}\nExplanation: Kublai \"evoked his public image as a sage emperor by following the rituals of Confucian propriety and ancestor veneration,\" which suggests that he followed Confucian and ancestor veneration rituals to help his image.\nThe answer: Confucian propriety and ancestor veneration", "{1, 3, 5}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Kublai Khan promoted commercial, scientific, and cultural growth, which implies that these areas were less developed before his reign. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for different types of growth, implying that they are distinct concepts. Rule 5 applies because animals and vehicles are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: commercial, scientific, and cultural growth", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: \"Pax Mongolica\" is a Latin term meaning \"Mongol peace\". \nThe answer: Mongol peace", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: southern China", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kublai Khan expanded the Grand Canal from southern China to Daidu in the north.\nThe answer: Daidu (in the north)", "{rule list: 4, 13, 20}\nExplanation: Kublai Khan welcomed foreign visitors to his court, including the Venetian merchant Marco Polo, who wrote the most influential European account of Yuan China. Therefore, the answer is Marco Polo.\nThe answer: Marco Polo", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou.\nThe answer: Song Emperor", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that during the Southern Song dynasty, the newly established Jin dynasty appointed Kong Duanyou's brother as Duke Yansheng in Qufu. Therefore, the Jin dynasty began during the Southern Song dynasty.\nThe answer: during the Southern Song dynasty", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Jin dynasty was established in 1115-1234, but it does not mention when it ended. However, the passage also mentions that the Yuan dynasty invited the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu to return to Qufu, which implies that the Jin dynasty had already ended by that point. Therefore, we can infer that the Jin dynasty ended before the Yuan dynasty. Since the Jin dynasty was established in 1115-1234, we can say that it ended before the Yuan dynasty, which was established in 1271. \nThe answer: Before the Yuan dynasty (established in 1271)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that during the Southern Song dynasty, Kong Duanyou's brother, Kong Duancao, was appointed as Duke Yansheng in Qufu. \nThe answer: Kong Duancao", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the question does not involve any of them. The order of the information in the passage is also important, as it first mentions the two Duke Yanshengs and then the number of Confucius's descendants in Quzhou. \nThe answer: 30,000.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Kublai strengthened his government in northern China, so the answer is northern China.\nThe answer: northern China", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kublai besieged Xiangyang \"between 1268 and 1273.\" This means that the attack on Xiangyang occurred sometime during that five-year period. Rule 3 reminds us that time is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color, so we cannot assume that the attack happened at the beginning or end of that period. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can say that the attack on Xiangyang occurred sometime after 1268 and before 1273. \nThe answer: between 1268 and 1273", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Xiangyang was the last obstacle in Kublai's way to capture the rich Yangzi River basin, which is an area he was trying to capture.\nThe answer: the rich Yangzi River basin", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The capital of the Song dynasty was Hangzhou, which was captured by Kublai in 1276, according to the passage. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which helps to identify that Hangzhou was the capital of the Song dynasty. \nThe answer: Hangzhou", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The last Song emperor drowned\" which is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject (the last Song emperor) was acted upon by the verb (drowned). Therefore, we need to apply rules 16 and 17, which state that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" and \"negations are important for the answer.\" The answer is that the last Song emperor drowned.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kublai's government faced financial difficulties after 1279, indicating that it was running out of money at that time.\nThe answer: after 1279", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon, which interfered with the invasion. Rule 1 applies because \"failed\" implies that the invasion was not successful, making the typhoon the reason for the failure. Rule 3 applies because \"inauspicious\" is a descriptor of the typhoon's quality, not its size, shape, age, or color.\nThe answer: an inauspicious typhoon", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. \nThe answer: Vietnam \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng as the battle where the Mongols were defeated by the Tran dynasty. This information is presented in a passive sentence, where the subject (Mongols) is acted upon the verb (defeated). Therefore, rules 16 and 23 apply.\nThe answer: Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The Tran defeated the Mongols at the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng in 1288, which is mentioned after Kublai's failed campaigns. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine that the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng happened after Kublai's failed campaigns. Rule 3 tells us that the concepts of location and time are different, so we don't need to worry about the location of the battle. \nThe answer: 1288", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Following the conquest of Dali in 1253...\" which is a passive sentence, indicating that Dali was conquered by the Yuan. This information is also presented chronologically, with the conquest happening before the events discussed later in the passage.\nThe answer: 1253", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin, as the Crown Prince.\nThe answer: Zhenjin", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\". Rule 22 establishes that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\". In the passage, it is stated that Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin, as the Crown Prince, but he died before Kublai in 1285. Therefore, Zhenjin died in 1285.\nThe answer: 1285", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Emperor Chengzong", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that Tem\u00fcr Khan is the same person as Emperor Chengzong. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence \"Tem\u00fcr Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather\" is in the active voice, indicating that Tem\u00fcr Khan was the one who made the decision. \nThe answer: from 1294 to 1307.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the identity of the fourth ruler of the Yuan dynasty. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the fourth ruler is the one who came after the third and before the fifth. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"The fourth Yuan emperor, Buyantu Khan (Ayurbarwada), was a competent emperor\" is in the active voice, with Buyantu Khan as the subject and \"was\" as the verb. Therefore, Buyantu Khan is the fourth ruler of the Yuan dynasty. \nThe answer: Buyantu Khan (Ayurbarwada)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: They didn't wish for him to actively support and adopt mainstream Chinese culture.", "{rule list: 13, 19}\nExplanation: Buyantu was mentored by Li Meng, but their gender is not specified, so rule 19 applies to indicate that their gender is irrelevant to their profession.\nThe answer: Li Meng", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Buyantu Khan \"liquidated\" the Department of State Affairs.\nThe answer: Department of State Affairs", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that Buyantu reintroduced the imperial examinations for prospective officials, so the answer is when he started doing this. The word \"resume\" is not used in the article, so rule 11 is not relevant. The answer is not affected by the emperor's gender or profession, so rules 19 and 4 are not relevant. The question does not contain any synonyms or typos, so rules 7 and 10 are not relevant. The answer is not affected by the size, shape, age, or color of anything, so rule 3 is not relevant. The answer is not related to animals or vehicles, so rules 5 and 6 are not relevant. The answer is not related to names or locations, so rules 13 and 14 are not relevant. The answer is not affected by negations, so rules 17 and 18 are not relevant. The answer is not related to former or latter entities, so rule 22 is not relevant. The answer is not related to professions or nationalities, so rule 4 is not relevant. The answer is not related to the composition of music or", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that Ayurbarwada's son comes after Ayurbarwada in the timeline. We use rule 23 to understand that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, \"was ruled by\" means that the subject is the emperor who ruled, and \"Ayurbarwada's son\" is the object of the sentence. \nThe answer: Gegeen Khan", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Gegeen Khan was the emperor from 1321 to 1323.\nThe answer: 1321 to 1323", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Gegeen appointed Baiju as grand chancellor during his reign.\nThe answer: Baiju", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"the comprehensive institutions of the Great Yuan\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"five princes from a rival faction\" were involved in the coup that assassinated Gegeen. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (five princes) is acted upon the verb (were involved). Therefore, we need to use rule 23 to correctly identify the number of princes involved.\nThe answer: five", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of a location where Yesun Temur died. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any names mentioned in the passage. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first mention of a location is more likely to be the answer. \nThe answer: Shangdu", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that Tugh Tem\u00fcr eventually won the civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals. The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 7 (synonyms), 12 (irrelevant passages), and 17 (negations). \nThe answer: War of the Two Capitals", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, Kusala is mentioned after Tugh Tem\u00fcr, so Kusala is the latter. Rule 22 states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last.\" Therefore, Tugh Tem\u00fcr is the former. \nThe answer: four days", "{rule list: 3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify who killed Tugh Temur. Rule 3 tells us that age, shape, size, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate answers that describe those characteristics. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that whoever killed Tugh Temur was not Tugh Temur himself. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Tugh Temur was the first to hold the throne before Kusala. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any negations in the passage. The answer: El Tem\u00fcr.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tugh Tem\u00fcr abdicated in favor of his brother Kusala, but Kusala died only four days later, supposedly killed with poison by El Tem\u00fcr. Therefore, Tugh Tem\u00fcr remounted the throne. \nThe answer: Tugh Tem\u00fcr", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Tugh Tem\u00fcr was known for his cultural contribution and adoption of measures honoring Confucianism and promoting Chinese cultural values. He founded the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature and supported Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism and Buddhism.\nThe answer: his cultural contribution", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it is mentioned that Tugh Tem\u00fcr founded the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature.\nThe answer: Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in the spring of 1329", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Tugh Tem\u00fcr's academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books, but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named Jingshi Dadian. Additionally, the question asks for the \"most notable\" publication, indicating that this is the most significant or important one. Therefore, rules 3 and 16 are relevant, as they emphasize the importance of concepts and the order of information. \nThe answer: Jingshi Dadian", "{rule list: 4, 5}\nExplanation: Tugh Temur's religious beliefs are mentioned in the last sentence of the passage. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it can be applied to religion as well. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, which means that religions and philosophies are different concepts. \nThe answer: Buddhism and Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the passage, Tugh Temur is mentioned before Rinchinbal, so Tugh Temur died before Rinchinbal.\nThe answer: 1332", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Emperor Ningzong", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Toghun Tem\u00fcr was 13 years old when he succeeded to the throne.\nThe answer: 13", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Toghun Tem\u00fcr was the last of the nine successors of Kublai Khan.\nThe answer: nine", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Toghtogha successfully completed the official histories of the Liao, Jin, and Song dynasties during his first administration. This means that the histories of these three dynasties were officially documented during Toghun's reign. \nThe answer: Liao, Jin, and Song dynasties", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes struggle, famine, bitterness, loss of influence, intrigues, rivalries, and unrest as problems faced by the Yuan dynasty near its end. Rule 1 applies because \"losing influence\" can be seen as being \"less influential\" than before. Rule 3 applies because the problems listed are related to the state of the dynasty, not its size, shape, age, or color. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for problems, and the answer is the opposite of what the passage describes. \nThe answer: struggle, famine, bitterness, loss of influence, intrigues, rivalries, unrest, and outlaws ravaging the country.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the sentence implies that the successors of Kublai Khan were seen as too Chinese by the Mongols outside of China, which means that the successors were less Mongol than the other Mongols. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a reason, and the answer should be a concept, not a physical attribute. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a reason for losing control, which implies a decrease in control, and the answer should reflect that decrease. \nThe answer: They were seen as too Chinese by the Mongols outside of China.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The later Yuan emperors were \"separated from both the army and the populace.\"\nThe answer: both the army and the populace", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about what the armies were too weak to stop. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to understand that the armies were too weak to stop the outlaws. \nThe answer: Outlaws", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: administration", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"From the late 1340s onwards, people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts, floods and the resulting famines.\" This indicates that the Yuan people suffered a series of natural disasters from the late 1340s onwards, which is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: late 1340s onwards", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Red Turban Rebellion", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Toghun Tem\u00fcr dismissed Toghtogha out of fear of betrayal.\nThe answer: Fear of betrayal.", "{3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Toghtogha led a large army to crush the Red Turban rebels, so the answer is the Red Turban rebels.\nThe answer: The Red Turban rebels.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Toghun Tem\u00fcr fled north to Shangdu from Khanbaliq in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the Ming dynasty, which was founded by Zhu Yuanzhang in the south. Therefore, the Ming dynasty was in power from 1368 to 1644.\nThe answer: 1368-1644", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: communications between the Yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia, the Ilkhanate", "{3, 5, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the cultural exchange that occurred during the Yuan dynasty due to the Mongols' extensive contacts with West Asia and Europe, as well as the influence of other cultures and peoples within the Mongol World Empire. The passage also mentions the introduction of Middle Eastern cartography, astronomy, medicine, clothing, and diet in East Asia by the Muslims of the Yuan dynasty. The answer is not directly stated, but it can be inferred that the extensive trade and communication facilitated by the political unity of China and much of central Asia encouraged cultural exchange under the Yuan. \nThe answer: Trade and communication facilitated by the political unity of China and much of central Asia", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Ilkhanate", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for crops that were \"introduced or popularized,\" implying that they were not previously common in the area. Therefore, the answer should be crops that were not previously grown in the Yuan dynasty. \nThe answer: carrots, turnips, new varieties of lemons, eggplants, and melons", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Western musical instruments were introduced to enrich Chinese performing arts, implying that the Yuan brought Western musical instruments to China.\nThe answer: Western musical instruments", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that differentiates between concepts of religion and government (rule 4) is relevant here, as well as the rule that negations are important for the answer (rule 17). The passage states that Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism enjoyed a period of toleration during the Yuan dynasty, so the answer is: \"Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism\". \nThe answer: Nestorianism and Roman Catholicism.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of Buddhism from the Yuan government.\" This means that the Yuan government discouraged Taoism in order to support Buddhism. \nThe answer: Taoism", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Yuan court reinstated Confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the Classics.\nThe answer: Confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the Classics", "{3, 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the fields of study that were advanced during the Yuan dynasty. Rule 3 tells us that fields of study are different concepts from other concepts such as religion or government. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore mentions of professions. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore mentions of religion and government. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" or any other negations. The answer is: travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education. \n\nThe answer: travel literature, cartography, geography, and scientific education.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the identity of the first known European to visit China and return, which is a matter of historical fact. Therefore, the relevant rules are those that deal with the order of events (rule 16) and the use of passive voice in the context (rule 23). \nThe answer: Marco Polo", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name that Marco Polo used to refer to the Yuan capital. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information related to those concepts can be ignored. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can focus on the information related to the name of the capital. The answer is \"Cambaluc\". \nThe answer: Cambaluc", "{3, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about Marco Polo's travels and the accuracy of his accounts. The question specifically asks for the English title of his book. \nThe answer: The Travels of Marco Polo", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Il milione", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the answer is that some suggest that Marco Polo acquired much of his knowledge through contact with Persian traders since many of the places he named were in Persian. This is because the article mentions that some argue over the accuracy of Marco Polo's accounts due to the lack of mentioning certain prominent sights in China, and they suspect that he learned about China from Persian traders instead of actually visiting it.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts helps us identify that \"astronomer\" is the profession of the person in question, and the rule that names are equally important for the answer tells us that the astronomer's name is Guo Shoujing.\nThe answer: Guo Shoujing", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is about the level of accuracy of the reformed lunisolar calendar. Rule 3 states that age and accuracy are different concepts, so we can eliminate age as a factor. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can rephrase the question as \"How much less accurate was Guo's reformed lunisolar calendar than the modern Gregorian calendar?\" The answer is \"only 26 seconds off.\" \nThe answer: 26 seconds off.", "{3, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that granaries were ordered built throughout the empire to provide against possible famines. This means that Kublai ordered the construction of granaries to prevent famines.\nThe answer: Kublai ordered the construction of granaries.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that during the Yuan period, Beijing became the terminus of the Grand Canal of China, which was completely renovated. This means that the Grand Canal reached Beijing during the Yuan period.\nThe answer: Beijing", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: sorghum", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China for the first time during the Yuan dynasty. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about who ruled China, which is related to the concept of political power rather than size, shape, age, or color. Rule 4 applies because the question asks about the rulers' nationality, which is a different concept from their profession. \nThe answer: non-native Chinese people", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Mongols are widely known to worship the Eternal Heaven.\" This indicates that the Mongols worshiped the Eternal Heaven.\nThe answer: the Eternal Heaven", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the dynasty that preceded the Yuan. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the question is asking for a dynasty means that nationality is important. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the dynasty that came before the Yuan is an earlier dynasty. \nThe answer: the Song dynasty", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we can infer that the question is asking for the dynasty that came after the Yuan. The rule that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts is irrelevant. \nThe answer: the Ming dynasty", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying what some Chinese people thought of the Yuan dynasty. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that concepts such as legitimacy are distinct from concepts such as ethnicity or nationality. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that nationality and profession are distinct concepts. Rule 8 is relevant because it tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, some Chinese considered the Yuan dynasty to be a legitimate dynasty of China, while others did not. Therefore, we can say that some Chinese considered the Yuan dynasty to be a legitimate dynasty of China, while others considered it to be a period of foreign domination. Rule 17 is relevant because it tells us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Some Chinese did not consider the Yuan dynasty a legitimate dynasty of China, but rather as a period of foreign domination.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer mentions that the bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire, including that of the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. Rule 3 is relevant because it states that different concepts, such as cultures, are distinct. Rule 4 is also relevant because it states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is asking about cultures, not nationalities. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question is asking about what cultures were part of Kublai's administration, so the answer is all the cultures mentioned in the passage: Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. \nThe answer: Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 is relevant because the question asks about the dynasties that inspired the Chinese-like elements of Kublai's government, so we need to consider the concept of \"more X than\" and its antonym. The answer mentions that the Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Therefore, the answer is Tang, Song, Liao, and Jin. \nThe answer: Tang, Song, Liao, and Jin.", "{4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can identify the advisers as Chinese without assuming their profession. The rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we can assume that the advisers are male. \nThe answer: Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as division of power and size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks about what kind of division of power the government had, so the answer should reflect that it had a tripartite division of power. Rule 16 is relevant because it explains that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is important for understanding the order of the different offices mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: The government had a tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Yuan government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices. This is an example of rule 3, which states that different concepts such as professions and shapes are not interchangeable. The passage also mentions the names of these three parts: the Central Secretariat to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. This is an example of rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: civil, military, and censorial offices", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the real military authority in Yuan times resided in the Privy Council, which implies that the military control was not in the hands of the Ministry of War. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the military authority was not in the hands of the Ministry of War does not mean that it was not in the hands of the Yuan. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"Yuan\" refers to the ruling dynasty and not to a specific person or group of people.\nThe answer: the Privy Council", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from size, shape, and color. Therefore, the age of the Six Ministries is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, since the article mentions the Sui and Tang dynasties before mentioning the Yuan administration, it can be inferred that the Six Ministries existed during the Sui and Tang dynasties. \nThe answer: During the Sui and Tang dynasties.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Ministry of Justice did not have authority over legal cases involving Mongols and Semuren.\nThe answer: Mongols and Semuren.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that during the Yuan dynasty, the Ministry of War had little significance compared to previous Chinese dynasties, as the real military authority resided in the Privy Council. This means that the answer is the Ministry of War.\nThe answer: Ministry of War", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Phags-pa script was invented in 1269. The question asks for the time of invention, which is a specific point in time and can be answered by the date given in the passage. The relevant rules are 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), as the date is a specific piece of information that can be extracted from the passage. \nThe answer: 1269", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The Phags-pa script was used for spelling Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese languages, which are different languages and fall under rule 3. The answer is Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese.\nThe answer: Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the Mongol Emperors could converse well in Chinese does not necessarily mean they knew the language well. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, if the Mongol Emperors could converse well in Chinese, it can be inferred that they did not know the language fluently. \nThe answer: The Mongol Emperors could converse well in Chinese, but they could not master written Chinese.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Tugh Temur", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Tugh Temur is the name of the emperor mentioned in the passage, but the question asks for his Chinese-style name. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that his Chinese-style name comes before his given name. Rule 22 tells us that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so we can infer that his Chinese-style name is Wenzong.\nThe answer: Wenzong", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"by 1290 in all parts of the Mongol Empire commoners were selling their children into slavery.\" This means that selling children into slavery was common among the Mongols by 1290.\nThe answer: 1290", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Kublai forbade the sale abroad of Mongols, which means he banned the international Mongol slave trade. According to rule 2, if Kublai forbade the sale abroad of Mongols, then he allowed the sale of Mongols within the Mongol Empire. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a specific time, and the answer requires understanding the timeline of events in the passage.\nThe answer: 1291", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan dynasty lived a life of decaying rural leisure, with income from the harvests of their Chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty. Therefore, they were not earning much money. \nThe answer: They were earning income from the harvests of their Chinese tenants, but it was not enough to cover the costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty.", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses various arts that flourished during the Yuan dynasty, including painting, calligraphy, poetry, and theater. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including different types of art. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is not relevant to the question. Rule 5 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and vehicles, which is not relevant to the question. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: painting, calligraphy, poetry, and theater", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others.\" This means that painting, poetry, and calligraphy were often practiced together by the same artists. \nThe answer: painting, poetry, and calligraphy", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"age\" is a different concept from other concepts means that the age of the dynasty is not relevant to the answer. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" means that the Song dynasty came before the Yuan dynasty.\nThe answer: Song dynasty", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets.\" This means that the form of poetry developed in the Yuan was the qu.\nThe answer: the qu", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: zaju", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"unlike the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam,\" implying that at least one of the western khanates had converted to Islam. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the western khanates are mentioned does not necessarily mean they are larger or more important than the Yuan dynasty. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the western khanates are mentioned does not necessarily mean they are a different nationality than the Yuan dynasty. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the western khanates had converted to Islam, then the Yuan dynasty had not. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that the question asks which khanates had not converted to Islam is relevant. \nThe answer: The question does not have a clear answer as it is asking for information that is not provided in the article.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. \nThe answer: Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants, and the Sakya sect.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion under the Yuan dynasty, and that Kublai Khan, the founder of the dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants. However, he only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, making other religions less important. Therefore, the answer is Tibetan Buddhism. \nThe answer: Tibetan Buddhism", "{3, 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, but the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs is a government agency, so rule 4 applies. The question asks for a government agency, so rule 16 applies. The answer is: Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan).", "{3, 5, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so any information about vehicles is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that Kublai Khan was the founder of the Yuan dynasty. Therefore, the answer is: the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: Zhu Shijie's birthdate is a specific piece of information that can be found in the article. Rule 16 helps to establish the order of events, and Rule 22 clarifies that \"he\" refers to Zhu Shijie.\nThe answer: 1249", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Zhu Shijie is a person, so we use rule 16 to determine that his last name comes before his first name. The question asks for his date of death, which is given in the article as 1314. This is a simple factual question that does not require any additional rules.\nThe answer: 1314", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Zhu Shijie solved simultaneous equations using a rectangular array of coefficients, which is equivalent to modern matrices. Therefore, the modern math concept that Zhu Shijie did work similar to is matrices.\nThe answer: matrices", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks about a specific type of math that was advanced during the Yuan era. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so any mention of a specific profession or nationality is not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"math\" in the article. The article mentions \"polynomial algebra\" and \"simultaneous equations,\" which are both types of math. \nThe answer: polynomial algebra", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1303", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rules of profession and nationality being different concepts and names being equally important for the answer are not relevant to this question. Guo Shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars, specifically working on spherical trigonometry and deriving a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations. He created the Shoushi Li or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons, which was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the Yuan dynasty. Therefore, the answer is that Guo Shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars. \nThe answer: He applied mathematics to the construction of calendars.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Gou used mathematics, specifically spherical trigonometry, for his astronomical calculations and applied it to the construction of calendars. \nThe answer: mathematics", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Guo Shoujing's calendar was called the Shoushi Li (\u6388\u6642\u66a6).\nThe answer: Shoushi Li", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Guo Shoujing's calendar was called the Shoushi Li or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons. The question asks for the English name of the calendar, which is not explicitly stated in the article. However, rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can infer that the Shoushi Li is the English name for Guo Shoujing's calendar. Rule 17 also reminds us that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question.\nThe answer: Shoushi Li or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Gou's calendar, the Shoushi Li, was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the Yuan dynasty. This means that it became the official calendar in 1281.\nThe answer: 1281", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if otachi are non-Mongol physicians, then Mongol physicians are not otachi. Therefore, otachi refers to non-Mongol physicians.\nThe answer: Non-Mongol physicians.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Otachi doctors used herbal remedies, which distinguished them from the spiritual cures of Mongol shamanism.\nThe answer: herbal remedies", "{rule list: 3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Mongol shamans used spiritual cures, which is different from the herbal remedies used by non-Mongol physicians. This is a negation question, so we need to pay attention to the use of \"not\" or \"n't\" in the question.\nThe answer: spiritual cures", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kublai created the Imperial Academy of Medicine to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors. This is an example of an active sentence where Kublai is the subject who acted upon the verb \"created\" to form the object \"Imperial Academy of Medicine.\" Therefore, we can apply rules 16 and 23 to determine that Kublai created the department to train doctors.\nThe answer: Imperial Academy of Medicine", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: medical ethics were compatible with Confucian virtues and it ensured a high income", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Chinese medical tradition of the Yuan had \"Four Great Schools\". \nThe answer: Four", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Four Great Schools were inherited from the Jin dynasty.", "{3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: Chinese medicine spread to other parts of the Mongol empire through military campaigns and was transmitted westward to the Middle East and the rest of the empire through techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse diagnosis, and various herbal drugs and elixirs. \nThe answer: Through military campaigns and transmission of techniques such as acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse diagnosis, and various herbal drugs and elixirs.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage lists several techniques used in Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse diagnosis, and various herbal drugs and elixirs. These techniques are all different concepts related to the practice of Chinese medicine. \nThe answer: acupuncture, moxibustion, pulse diagnosis, and various herbal drugs and elixirs", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Wei Yilin is a person and the question asks for a specific time-related information, so rule 16 applies. The passage provides a specific date of birth and death for Wei Yilin, so we need to identify the last name mentioned in the passage and extract the date of death. This requires understanding that the sentence \"Wei Yilin (1277\u20131347) invented a suspension method for reducing dislocated joints\" provides the birth and death years of Wei Yilin. Rule 23 applies because the question is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: 1347", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Western medicine practiced by Nestorian Christians at the Yuan court, sometimes labeled as Muslim medicine.", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that Western medicine was practiced in China by the Nestorian Christians of the Yuan court. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for a person who founded the Office of Western Medicine, which is a profession. Rule 13 applies because the question asks for a specific person. \nThe answer: Jesus the Interpreter", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The Office of Western Medicine was founded in 1263 during the reign of Kublai. This is a straightforward question that requires identifying a specific piece of information from the passage. Rules 16 and 23 are relevant because they help establish the chronological order of events and the importance of passive voice in the sentence structure. \nThe answer: 1263", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Chinese physicians opposed Western medicine because its humoral system contradicted the yin-yang and wuxing philosophy underlying traditional Chinese medicine.\nThe answer: humoral system", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the passage states that Western medicine's humoral system contradicted the yin-yang and wuxing philosophy underlying traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, Western medicine is less yin-yang and wuxing than traditional Chinese medicine.\nThe answer: yin-yang and wuxing", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, \"acquire\" can be considered a synonym for \"transfer,\" so rule 8 applies. The answer is \"Chinese printing technology was transferred to the Mongols through Kingdom of Qocho and Tibetan intermediaries.\"", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Wang Zhen wrote the Nong Shu and that it was printed with earthenware movable type, a technology invented in the 12th century. Additionally, the article does not mention any other authors of the Nong Shu. Therefore, we can use rule 13 to determine that names are equally important for the answer and rule 16 to determine that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Wang Zhen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Wang Zhen's Nong Shu was printed with earthenware movable type, which was invented in the 12th century. This means that earthenware movable type was invented in the 12th century, which is earlier than the time period discussed in the article (the Yuan dynasty). \nThe answer: 12th century.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Ogedei is a person mentioned in the article, and \"wife\" is a term used to refer to a female spouse.\nThe answer: T\u00f6regene Khatun", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In 1273, the Mongols created the Imperial Library Directorate, a government-sponsored printing office.\" This is a clear statement of when the Imperial Library Directorate was established, and it is in the active voice, so rule 16 applies. Additionally, the sentence is in the past tense, indicating that it is a historical event, so rule 23 applies. \nThe answer: 1273", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the paper money of the Yuan was called \"chao\".\nThe answer: chao", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: \"Chao were made from the bark of mulberry trees.\"\nThe answer: bark of mulberry trees", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1275", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Yuan government used woodblocks to print paper money before switching to bronze plates in 1275. This means that woodblocks were used before bronze plates.\nThe answer: woodblocks", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Il-khanate government issued paper money in 1294, which directly answers the question.\nThe answer: 1294", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. These rules are relevant because they help us understand that the question is asking about a political system, not a physical or biological characteristic. The answer is Mongolian patrimonial feudalism. \n\nThe answer: Mongolian patrimonial feudalism.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"system of government\" and \"traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system\" are different concepts. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which is relevant because the question asks about the first concept mentioned in the passage. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is relevant because the passage describes the system of government as being created by Kublai Khan, which is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including social status and ethnicity. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. The answer: various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the unequal treatment of Chinese versus Mongols made the dynasty seem \"colonial.\" Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks how the unequal treatment made the dynasty seem, implying that the unequal treatment had a negative effect on the dynasty's image. \nThe answer: The unequal treatment of Chinese versus Mongols gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong \"colonial\" coloration.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The question asks where Persians were more successful compared to Chinese in the Yuan, implying that there were differences in success between the two groups. The passage states that \"there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate,\" indicating that Persians were more successful in reaching high posts in the Ilkhanate compared to North and South Chinese in the Yuan. Therefore, the answer is the Ilkhanate. \n\nThe answer: Ilkhanate", "{3, 4, 6, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, but the question is about administrators, which is a profession. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, but they are not relevant to the question. The relevant information is that the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, as well as sending Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia. \nThe answer: Central Asian Muslims, Han Chinese, and Khitans.", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" helps us understand that the answer is not referring to a specific nationality, but rather to a group of people who were sent as administrators. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" helps us understand that the answer is not referring to who the Mongols did not send as administrators. \nThe answer: Han Chinese and Khitans", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers. According to rule 3, location is important for the answer. According to rule 16, first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers.\nThe answer: Artisans and farmers.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The Mongol appointed Governor of Samarqand was a Qara-Khitay (Khitan), held the title Taishi, familiar with Chinese culture his name was Ahai.\" This sentence follows the passive voice structure, where the subject (the Mongol appointed Governor) is acted upon by the verb (was made). Therefore, we apply rules 16 and 23 to determine that the Governor's name was Ahai.\nThe answer: Ahai", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that some policies of the Yuan Emperors severely discriminated against Muslims, restricting their religious practices and forcing them to eat food the Mongol way. This implies that Muslims disliked the discriminatory policies of the Yuan Emperors. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including religion and food. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the Yuan Emperors were more discriminatory towards Muslims than Muslims were accepting of the discriminatory policies. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer, and the question asks for what policies Muslims disliked, implying a negative sentiment. \nThe answer: Muslims disliked the discriminatory policies of the Yuan Emperors, which restricted their religious practices and forced them to eat food the Mongol way.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Kosher butchering", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the founder of the Ming dynasty, which is a historical event. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the founder's name should come before the dynasty name. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat\" is in the active voice and provides the answer to the question. \nThe answer: Zhu Yuanzhang", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. Therefore, the second meaning of the Chinese word for 'barracks' is 'thanks'.\nThe answer: 'thanks'", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the subject of the rebellion, which is the entity that performed the action of revolting. Rule 3 and 4 indicate that religion and ethnicity are different concepts from actions and events, and that profession and nationality are different concepts from actions and events. Rule 8 indicates that if one entity is more X than another, then the other entity is more antonym(X) than the first. Rule 17 indicates that negations are important for the answer. The passage states that the Muslims in the semu class revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion, and that the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding. Therefore, the answer is: the Muslims in the semu class.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The historian Frederick W. Mote believed that the term \"social classes\" was misleading when referring to the Yuan's four-class system. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the four-class system was not based on actual social power and wealth is relevant. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, as the question asks for the person who thought that the system should not be called social classes. \nThe answer: Frederick W. Mote", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Mote argues that the position within the class system does not necessarily reflect actual social power and wealth. Rule 3 applies because Mote distinguishes between the formal class system and actual social standing. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for Mote's opinion, which is a negation of the common understanding of the class system. \nThe answer: \"degrees of privilege\" to which they were entitled institutionally and legally", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that a person's position within the four-class system in China was not necessarily an indication of their actual social power and wealth. Therefore, there were many Chinese who had unexpected status, meaning they may have had lower positions within the class system but were still wealthy and well-respected. \nThe answer: Wealthy and well-respected status", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts,\" meaning that the answer cannot be related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that there were \"less rich Mongol and Semu than there were Mongol and Semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated,\" indicating that there were many Mongols who lived in poverty and were ill treated despite their expected status as a ruling class. Therefore, the unexpected status of these Mongols was poverty and ill treatment. \nThe answer: poverty and ill treatment", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the earlier a group surrendered to the Mongols, the higher they were placed in the class system. Rule 3 applies because the article specifies that the ranking was based on surrender date, not ethnicity. \nThe answer: Northern China", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The class system was based on the date of surrender to the Mongols, not ethnicity. The earlier they surrendered, the higher they were placed. Therefore, Southern Chinese were ranked lower because they withstood and fought to the last before surrendering. \nThe answer: Southern China", "1, 2, 3, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because if Northern Chinese were ranked higher, then Southern Chinese were ranked lower. Rule 2 applies because the article states that the earlier a group surrendered, the higher they were placed, and the Southern Chinese withstood and fought to the last before surrendering. Rule 3 applies because the reason for the ranking was based on surrender date, not ethnicity. Rule 8 applies because if Northern Chinese were ranked higher, then Southern Chinese were ranked more antonym(higher) than them. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the reason why Southern Chinese were ranked lower. \nThe answer: Because they surrendered later to the Mongols.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that the reason for the order of the classes was the date they surrendered to the Mongols, not their ethnicity. Therefore, rule 3 applies. Additionally, the earlier they surrendered, the higher they were placed, which means that Northern Chinese, who surrendered earlier, were ranked higher than Southern Chinese. Therefore, rule 1 also applies.\nThe answer: Because they surrendered earlier to the Mongols.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Major commerce during this era gave rise to favorable conditions for private southern Chinese manufacturers and merchants.\" This means that the Yuan's increase in commerce helped southern Chinese manufacturers and merchants.\nThe answer: southern Chinese manufacturers and merchants", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for who the Mongols gave control of Korea, which implies that they did give control to someone. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for who the Mongols gave control to, so we can rephrase it as \"who did the Mongols not give control of Korea to?\" Rule 8 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can rephrase the question as \"who was ranked last in the Mongol court?\" Rule 17 applies because negations are important for the answer. The answer is: the Korean King.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the entity ranked lower than the Uighur King of Qocho. Rule 16 applies because the order of ranking is given in the passage. \nThe answer: the Karluk Kara-Khanid ruler", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the Karluk Kara-Khanid ruler was ranked higher than the Korean King, but lower than the Uighur King of Qocho. Therefore, the answer is that the Karluk Kara-Khanid ruler was ranked below the Uighur King of Qocho and above the Korean King.", "1, 8, 17, 23\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the reason why the Uighurs were ranked higher than the Koreans. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the reason why the Uighurs were ranked higher, which implies that the Koreans were ranked lower. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the reason why the Uighurs were ranked higher, which implies that it was not because of any negative reason. Rule 23 applies because the passage is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: Because they surrendered to the Mongols first and peacefully without violently resisting.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: Hebei is part of the Central Region of China, which was considered the most important region of the dynasty and directly governed by the Central Secretariat at Khanbaliq (modern Beijing). (Note: Rule 3 is relevant to distinguish that \"region\" and \"province\" are different concepts, and Rule 13 is relevant to consider that location is equally important for the answer.) \nThe answer: The Central Region.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The Central Region in the Yuan was directly governed by the Central Secretariat at Khanbaliq (modern Beijing). Therefore, rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) are relevant.\nThe answer: the Central Secretariat", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The Central Region was directly governed by the Central Secretariat at Khanbaliq (modern Beijing). \nThe answer: Khanbaliq/Beijing", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Khanbaliq is modern-day Beijing.\nThe answer: Beijing", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Zhongshu Sheng", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The article provides information about Kenya's location, including its continent (Africa), neighboring countries (Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia), and bodies of water it borders (Lake Victoria, Lake Turkana, and the Indian Ocean). The irrelevant information includes the country's membership in the East African Community, its capital city, and its population. \nThe answer: Africa", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so being a founding member is not a profession. The rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so \"Kenya\" is the relevant name. \nThe answer: the East African Community (EAC)", "{rule list: 16, 20, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the capital of Kenya, which is a specific piece of information that can be directly extracted from the article. Rule 16 applies to determine that the capital comes before the mention of the largest city, which is Nairobi. Rule 20 applies to clarify that \"it\" refers to Kenya, not Nairobi. Rule 23 is relevant to understand that the sentence is in the active voice, with \"Nairobi\" as the subject and \"is\" as the verb.\nThe answer: Nairobi", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Using these rules, we can determine that Tanzania borders the south of Kenya.\nThe answer: Tanzania.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Kenya...had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014.\" We can use rule 3 to understand that \"population\" is a different concept from \"territory\" or \"terrain.\" Rule 12 tells us that we can ignore the other details in the article. Finally, rule 16 tells us that we should read the question carefully and output only the population number.\nThe answer: approximately 45 million people", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if Kenya has a warm and humid tropical climate, then it does not have a cold and dry climate. \nThe answer: warm and humid tropical climate", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the climate is cooler is not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the climate near the savannah grasslands is warmer than the climate on the Indian Ocean coastline. \nThe answer: warmer", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the climate and geography of Kenya. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if Mount Kenya has snow permanently on its peaks, then other mountains do not. \nThe answer: Mount Kenya", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Somalia and Ethiopia", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Kenya is known for its safaris, diverse climate and geography, and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks, as well as its world heritage sites and beaches where international yachting competitions are held.\nThe answer: Kenya is known for its safaris, wildlife reserves and national parks, world heritage sites, and beaches.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: since the Lower Paleolithic period", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: by the first millennium AD", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that ethnicity and nationality are different concepts (4), and that population demographics such as ethnicity and language are different from physical characteristics such as location (3). Therefore, the answer is not a location, but rather an ethnic group. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts (5) and that the answer cannot be a profession (4) or a color (3) further supports this. Finally, the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B (8) helps us understand that the answer is not a minority group, but rather the majority group. \nThe answer: Bantu and Nilotic populations, which together constitute around 97% of the nation's residents.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 19th century", "{16, 17, 22}\nExplanation: We need to identify the date when Kenya became independent, which is a specific event. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we need to look for the earliest possible mention of Kenya's independence. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any words that indicate the opposite of independence. Rule 22 tells us that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, so we need to be careful when two entities are listed. The answer: December 1963.", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya.\" This is a straightforward answer that does not require any complex rules.\nThe answer: Mount Kenya", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the words Kirinyaga, Kirenyaa, and Kiinyaa in the Kikuyu, Embu, and Kamba languages respectively, are possibly linked to the name Kenya and mean \"God's resting place.\" This matches the question's phrasing of \"words linked to the word Kenya.\"\nThe answer: Kirinyaga, Kirenyaa, and Kiinyaa", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that these words mean \"God's resting place\" in the Kikuyu, Embu, and Kamba languages.\nThe answer: \"God's resting place\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: both Kenia and Kegnia", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: some say that this was a very precise notation of a correct African pronunciation /\u02c8k\u025bnj\u0259/", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer (rule 13) and first comes before last and last comes after first (rule 16). \nThe answer: Joseph Thompsons", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1862", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the animals are the biggest is not relevant to their name. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the answer cannot be \"Big Five game vehicles.\" \nThe answer: \"Big Five\"", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The \"Big Five\" game animals of Africa, that is the lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant, can be found in Kenya and in the Masai Mara in particular.\nThe answer: lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that the \"Big Five\" game animals of Africa can be found in Kenya and in the Masai Mara in particular.

This directly answers the question.\nThe answer: between June and September", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them cannot be used to answer the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the wildebeest migrate a distance of 2,900 kilometers, then they are searching for food and water supplies over a long distance. \nThe answer: 2,900 kilometers (1,802 mi)", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Primate fossils were found in Kenya more than 20 million years ago.\nThe answer: more than 20 million years ago", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other factors, so we can ignore the mention of primates from 20 million years ago. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last\", so we can infer that Homo habilis lived in Kenya before Homo erectus. Rule 23 tells us that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb, so we can rephrase \"possible direct ancestors\" to \"direct possible ancestors\". \nThe answer: between 1.8 and 2.5 million years ago, during the Pleistocene epoch.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a person's name, so rule 13 applies.

Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"outbreak\" in the question. Rule 22 tells us that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed, which in this case is not relevant. \nThe answer: August 1914", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the names of the two governors who agreed to a truce at the outbreak of World War I to keep their colonies out of direct hostilities. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of their professions. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first governor mentioned is from British East Africa and the second is from German East Africa. \nThe answer: the governor of British East Africa and the governor of German East Africa.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck took command of the German military forces.\" This is a passive sentence, where the subject (German military forces) is acted upon the verb (took command). Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that \"Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck\" is the answer. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we know that \"took command\" is referring to von Lettow-Vorbeck taking command of the German military forces.\nThe answer: Lt Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the tactics used by von Lettow's group. Rule 3 reminds us that \"tactics\" is a different concept from \"size, shape, age, and color\" and therefore cannot be confused with them. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more effective than B, then B is less effective than A. Therefore, since von Lettow's group remained undefeated, we can infer that they were very effective in their tactics. \nThe answer: von Lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Northern Rhodesia (today Zambia)", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the Kikuyu people were located in the central highlands.\nThe answer: central highlands", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Kikuyu people were \"itinerant farmers,\" indicating that they did not have a fixed location for farming and likely moved around to find suitable land. This aligns with rule 3, which distinguishes between concepts of size, shape, age, and color, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is: as itinerant farmers.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The settlers banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and granted less land to the landless in exchange for their labor, which made it difficult for the Kikuyu people to make a living from the land. This implies that the settlers were taking actions that were detrimental to the interests of the Kikuyu people. Therefore, rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B) apply. \nThe answer: The settlers protected their interests by taking actions that were detrimental to the interests of the Kikuyu people.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage directly states \"There were 80,000 white settlers living in Kenya in the 1950s.\"\nThe answer: 80,000", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that War\u0169hi\u0169 Itote was captured on 15 January 1954.\nThe answer: 15 January 1954", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Operation Anvil opened on 24 April 1954.\" This is a clear statement of when the operation began, and the relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb). \nThe answer: 24 April 1954", "{rule list: 1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents.\" This means that the Home Guard killed 4,686 of the Mau Mau insurgents.\nThe answer: 4,686", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Swynnerton Plan.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage provides a chronological sequence of events, with the first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council taking place in 1957.\nThe answer: 1957", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that British hopes of handing power to \"moderate\" local rivals were not fulfilled, and it was actually the Kenya African National Union (KANU) of Jomo Kenyatta that formed a government.

Rule 4 applies to distinguish between different concepts, such as profession and nationality, which are not relevant to this question. Rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, which is also not relevant to this question. Therefore, the answer can be found directly in the context: Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic. \nThe answer: presidential representative democratic republic", "{4, 5, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 5 (animals and vehicles are different concepts), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The answer is \"head of state\" and \"head of government\".", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the executive power is a person's name. The rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the executive power is a physical object. Therefore, the executive power refers to the government. \nThe answer: the government", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly and the Senate. This means that both the executive (government) and a separate legislative body (National Assembly and Senate) have control over legislative power.\nThe answer: both the government and the National Assembly and the Senate", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, indicating that it is a separate branch of government.\nThe answer: Judiciary", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the ranking of Kenya on the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), which is a measure of public sector corruption in different countries. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the ranking of Kenya on the CPI is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Kenya ranks low on the CPI, it means that it has a high level of corruption. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer should reflect that Kenya's ranking on the CPI is low. \nThe answer: 139th out of 176 total countries with a score of 27/100.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for what the CPI measures, not what it does not measure. The answer is: the prevalence of public sector corruption.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the ranking of Kenya on the Corruption Perception Index in 2012. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"place\" which is a synonym for \"rank.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negation, so the answer should reflect that Kenya ranks low on the index. \nThe answer: 139th", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions the establishment of a new and independent Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), which suggests that the Kenyan government is taking steps to curb corruption. The use of the word \"curb\" in the question implies a negation, so rule 17 applies. \nThe answer: Kenya does not curb corruption, but the government has established a new and independent Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: President Kibaki is a politician and the question asks for his party affiliation, which falls under the concept of profession and nationality (rule 4). The article states that President Kibaki ran for re-election under the Party of National Unity (rule 16, first comes before last). \nThe answer: Party of National Unity", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: President Kibaki ran against the main opposition party, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM).\nThe answer: The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)", "{rule list: 2, 8, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding that the election was flawed and that there were accusations of complicity on the part of the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK). Rule 2 applies because the race tightened between the two candidates, and Kibaki overtook Odinga by a substantial margin after votes from his stronghold arrived later. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for what led to protests and open discrediting, which implies a negative outcome. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what led to protests and open discrediting, which implies a negation. Rule 23 applies because the answer requires understanding that the ECK was acted upon by the protests and discrediting. \nThe answer: flawed election and accusations of complicity on the part of the ECK", "{rule list: 13, 20, 22, 24}\nExplanation: The question asks for a person who called themselves a specific title. Rule 13 states that names are important for the answer, so we need to identify the person who called themselves the \"People's President.\" Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we need to look for a male person. Rule 22 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last, but since there are only two entities mentioned (Kibaki and Odinga), this rule is not relevant. Rule 24 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, but since the question is not in the passive voice, this rule is not relevant. \nThe answer: Raila Odinga", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: programmes to avoid similar disasters in the future", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions several organizations that started programs to avoid future election riots in Kenya. The question specifically asks about the group that initiated community dialogues. Therefore, we can use rule 13 to determine that names are equally important for the answer and rule 16 to determine that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission", "{rule list: 4, 12, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer must refer to a group that started peace meetings. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya's name. Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the mention of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission and the Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation process. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can focus on the mention of \"the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya\" as a group. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names, so we can assume that \"the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya\" is a group referred to by \"she.\" Therefore, the answer is: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Kenya.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for what was started after the new programs were in place, indicating a cause-and-effect relationship. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the negation \"avoid similar disasters in the future\" implies that the programs were put in place to prevent future election riots. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, and in this case, the programs were the subject and the action was starting. Therefore, the answer is that measures were taken to prevent future election riots.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the date when Kibaki and Odinga signed an agreement. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that Kibaki is likely the first person mentioned and Odinga is the last person mentioned. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" which means that the sentence structure may indicate whether Kibaki or Odinga is the subject of the sentence. The answer: On 28 February 2008.", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the question is asking about Odinga's role in the government, which is his profession. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Kibaki is the president, then Odinga is not the president. \nThe answer: Second Prime Minister", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer should not mention nationality. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we need to identify which party the president belongs to. The answer: The president appointed cabinet ministers from both PNU and ODM camps.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: based on each party's strength in Parliament", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the coalition would hold until the end of the current Parliament or if either of the parties withdraws from the deal before then.\" This means that the coalition government would last until the end of the current Parliament or until one of the parties withdraws from the deal, whichever comes first.\nThe answer: Until the end of the current Parliament or if either of the parties withdraws from the deal before then.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the PM will have power to co-ordinate and supervise the functions of the Government, indicating that the PM will have more power than other government officials. Rule 4 applies because profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is asking about the PM's power, not their nationality. \nThe answer: The functions of the Government.", "{1, 13, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who brought together the former rivals at the signing ceremony. The relevant information is found in the sentence \"The world watched Annan and his UN-backed panel and African Union chairman Jakaya Kikwete as they brought together the former rivals to the signing ceremony.\" The answer is Kofi Annan. \nThe answer: Kofi Annan.", "{rule list: 13, 14, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of the signing ceremony. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 14 states that locations are equally important for the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage mentions that the signing ceremony was held on the steps of Nairobi's Harambee House, so the answer is Nairobi. \nThe answer: Nairobi", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes a timeline of events, starting with the establishment of a new office of the PM and ending with the approval of a power-sharing deal. The question asks for a specific point in this timeline. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that we can use the chronological order of events to determine when representatives started working on the finer details of the deal. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that we need to look for an active sentence that describes when representatives started working on the finer details of the deal. The sentence \"On 29 February 2008, representatives of PNU and ODM began working on the finer details of the power-sharing agreement\" fits both of these criteria. \nThe answer: February 29, 2008", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to share power equally between Kibaki's PNU and Odinga's ODM", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Eliminating the position of Prime Minister and reducing the powers of the President.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when a vote was held to ratify the change to the constitution. The use of the word \"when\" indicates that a specific time is being asked for. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the absence of negations in the question. Rule 23 reminds us that passive voice changes the order of the subject and the verb. The sentence \"A referendum to vote on the proposed constitution was held on 4 August 2010\" is in passive voice, so we need to identify the subject and the verb to determine the answer. \nThe answer: 4 August 2010", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The new constitution delegates more power to local governments and gives Kenyans a bill of rights.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"It was promulgated on 27 August 2010\" which is a passive sentence, meaning that the subject (the new constitution) was acted upon the verb (promulgated) by an unspecified agent. Therefore, we need to use rule 23 to determine that the answer is August 27, 2010.\nThe answer: August 27, 2010", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Second Republic", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a Security Laws Amendment Bill in December 2014. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a specific date, and negations in the question are important for the answer. Rule 22 is also relevant because it clarifies that \"later\" refers to the passing of the bill, not the signing of it. \nThe answer: December 2014", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for the reason behind the Security Laws Amendment Bill. The word \"necessary\" implies a positive reason, so we need to consider negations in the rules. Rules 17 and 18 state that negations are important for the answer and negations in the question are important for the answer. The article states that supporters of the law suggested it was necessary to guard against armed groups. \nThe answer: To guard against armed groups.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify who criticized the security bill, which is a negation. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as profession and nationality are different, so we can't confuse who criticized with who supported the bill. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the critics are the opposite of the supporters. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: opposition politicians, human rights groups, and nine Western countries.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that opposition politicians, human rights groups, and nine Western countries criticized the security bill, arguing that it infringed on democratic freedoms. The use of the word \"criticized\" indicates a negation, which is important for the answer. Additionally, the reason for the criticism is related to the concept of democratic freedoms, which falls under the rule that political concepts are different from nationality. \nThe answer: It infringed on democratic freedoms.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity that warned of the potential impact of the Security Laws Amendment Bill. Rule 3 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of countries in the passage. Rule 4 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for specific names mentioned in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"cautioning\" in the passage. \nThe answer: The governments of the United States, Britain, Germany, and France collectively issued a press statement cautioning about the law's potential impact.", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"the 2007 election aftermath,\" which implies that there was some sort of issue or problem that occurred after the election. Rule 3 reminds us that age and events are different concepts, so we can infer that the election took place in 2007 but the aftermath refers to a specific period of time after the election. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can assume that \"result\" means the outcome of the election. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we should note that the passage does not explicitly state what the result of the election was. However, we can infer that there was some sort of controversy or conflict related to the election. \nThe answer: The passage does not provide a clear answer to this question.", "{rule list: 10, 17, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who decided not to visit the country in 2013. The article states that \"US President Barack Obama chose not to visit the country during his mid-2013 African trip.\" The use of \"chose not to\" indicates a negation, which is important to consider according to rule 17. The pronoun \"he\" in the question refers to a male name, which is clarified in rule 20. \nThe answer: Barack Obama", "{3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify where Kenyatta visited at the invitation of the President. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse location with profession or nationality. Rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer. Rule 16 tells us that we should prioritize the order of events. \nThe answer: China.", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: Obama's visit to Kenya is being asked, so we need to find the sentence that mentions his visit. The sentence \"In July 2015 Obama visited Kenya, as the first American president to visit the country while in office.\" directly answers the question. Rule 16 helps us identify the chronological order of events, and rule 18 reminds us to pay attention to negations in the question.\nThe answer: July 2015", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The armed forces are regularly deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world. (profession and location are different concepts, and \"peacekeeping missions\" is a clear answer to the question)\nThe answer: peacekeeping missions", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The aftermath of the national elections in 2007 was violence that subsequently engulfed the country.\nThe answer: violence", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about \"allegations\" which implies a negative aspect. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of \"armed forces\" being deployed in peacekeeping missions. \nThe answer: serious allegations of human rights violations", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article only mentions Kenya's armed forces being tainted by corruption allegations, so there are no other forces mentioned. However, the question contains the word \"other\", which implies that there are multiple forces being referred to. Therefore, the answer is \"none\" or \"no other forces were mentioned\". \nThe answer: none", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The corruption in Kenya's armed forces has been less in public view because the operations of the armed forces have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of \"state security\". This is due to the fact that the armed forces have been less subject to public scrutiny and notoriety. (rule 3: size, shape, age, and color are different concepts; rule 17: negations are important for the answer)\nThe answer: Because the operations of the armed forces have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of \"state security\".", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: recruitment and procurement of Armoured Personnel Carriers", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: certain decisions of procurement", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: HDI is a measure of human development, so we need to find the value of Kenya's HDI. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant, nor is the rule about animals and vehicles. The rule that negations are important for the answer is relevant because the question asks for the value of Kenya's HDI, which is a measure of development, and the passage states that Kenya's HDI is 0.519, which is a low ranking of 145 out of 186 in the world. The rule that negations in the question are important for the answer is not relevant. \nThe answer: 0.519", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Kenya is the biggest and most advanced economy in east and central Africa.\" This indicates that Kenya is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: Kenya", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"as of 2005, 17.7% of Kenyans lived on less than $1.25 a day.\"\nThe answer: less than $1.25", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Kenya is in Africa and is the biggest economy in east and central Africa is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Kenya is usually classified as a frontier market, then it is not considered a developed market. Finally, the rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that Kenya is not one of the least developed countries is relevant. \nThe answer: frontier market", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: rapid expansion in telecommunication and financial activity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that under-developed economies that have not attained food security have an unreliable agricultural sector, which is a consistent characteristic. This implies that attaining food security is an important catalyst of economic growth. Additionally, rule 8 states that if something is more X than something else, then the other thing is more antonym(X) than it. In this case, the passage states that the service sector contributes 62% of GDP while employing only 25% of the labor force, which implies that the service sector is more efficient than the agricultural sector in terms of contributing to economic growth. Therefore, food security is an important catalyst of economic growth. \nThe answer: Attaining food security", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that the service, industry, and manufacturing sectors only employ 25% of the labor force, while the agricultural sector employs 75%. Therefore, the smallest work force sector is the industry and manufacturing sector.\nThe answer: industry and manufacturing", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify the percentage of the labor force that works in agriculture. Rule 3 tells us that \"employment\" and \"GDP contribution\" are different concepts, so we need to focus on the labor force. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, if the service, industry, and manufacturing sectors employ 25% of the labor force and contribute 75% of GDP, then the agricultural sector employs 75% of the labor force and contributes 22% of GDP. \nThe answer: 75%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kenya's services sector contributes 61% of GDP.\nThe answer: 61%", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kenya's services sector is dominated by tourism, which is a different concept from professions and nationalities. \nThe answer: Tourism", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks whether the tourism sector has had growth or reduction. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that the tourism sector has exhibited steady growth in most years since independence and has become the country's principal source of foreign exchange. Therefore, we can conclude that the tourism sector has had growth. Rule 8 is also relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, if the tourism sector had a reduction, it would be the antonym of growth. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. The question specifically asks whether there has been growth or reduction, so we need to consider the negation of both possibilities. \nThe answer: growth", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know what the tourists are attracted to, we can infer what they are not attracted to. The passage states that tourists are attracted mainly to the coastal beaches and the game reserves, notably, the expansive East and West Tsavo National Park. Therefore, we can infer that tourists are not attracted to other aspects of Kenya such as shopping malls or other types of attractions. \nThe answer: coastal beaches and game reserves, notably the East and West Tsavo National Park.", "{1, 2, 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the location from where the largest number of tourists come, which is a specific piece of information. Therefore, we can apply rules 1 and 2 to understand that \"largest number\" means \"most\" and \"from\" means \"coming mainly to.\" We can also apply rule 3 to understand that \"largest number\" does not refer to size, shape, age, or color. Finally, we can apply rule 7 to identify that \"largest number\" may be a synonym for \"attracted mainly to.\" \nThe answer: Germany and the United Kingdom.", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In 2005 agriculture, including forestry and fishing, accounted for 24% of GDP.\" This means that 24% of Kenya's GDP was from agriculture in 2005.\nThe answer: 24%", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: We need to identify the crops that contribute the most to Kenya's economy. This falls under the concept of agriculture, which is different from forestry and fishing (rule 5). The answer should not be a profession or nationality (rule 4). The answer should not be related to size, shape, age, or color (rule 3). \nThe answer: tea, horticultural produce, and coffee.", "{1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya's GDP, after the service sector. This answer is straightforward and does not require any complex reasoning or inference.\nThe answer: The service sector.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks about what can cause a decrease in corn production. The answer is \"weather-related fluctuations,\" which implies that when the weather is not favorable for corn growth, the production decreases. Therefore, the antonym of \"favorable\" is \"unfavorable,\" and the answer is \"unfavorable weather.\" \nThe answer: Unfavorable weather", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph is also not relevant. The relevant rules are that institutions and organizations are different concepts (rule 4) and that the answer to the question can be directly extracted from the context paragraph (rule 7). \nThe answer: International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that pigeon peas are very drought resistant and can be grown in areas with less than 650 mm annual rainfall, making them a good alternative to maize in particularly dry areas. Therefore, the reason they taught farmers to grow peas is to provide them with a more viable crop option in areas with low rainfall. Additionally, rule 8 applies because the question uses the word \"teach\" as a synonym for \"helping farmers grow.\" \nThe answer: To provide a more viable crop option in areas with low rainfall.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the project stimulated the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing, linking producers to wholesalers, which helped to increase local producer prices. This encouraged the commercialization of legumes. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including legumes and maize. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which are not relevant to this question. Rule 5 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and crops. Rule 6 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and vehicles. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if one entity is more of a certain characteristic than another, then the other entity is more of the antonym of that characteristic. Rule 12 is relevant because it explains that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 is relevant because it explains that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing, linking producers to wholesalers, which helped", "{2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the work to commercialize pigeon peas helped to increase local producer prices by 20-25% in Nairobi and Mombasa. This means that the producer prices increased as a result of the commercialization efforts.\nThe answer: It helped to increase local producer prices by 20-25%.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The increase in local producer prices has had a positive impact on farmers, allowing them to buy assets and move out of poverty. Negation is important because the question asks for the effect of the increase in prices. \nThe answer: It is enabling some farmers to buy assets and move out of poverty.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa.\" This means that the answer is the fertile highlands.\nThe answer: the fertile highlands", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage lists several crops that are grown in the fertile highlands, including tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat. \nThe answer: tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east.\nThe answer: semi-arid savanna to the north and east.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the mention of agriculture and poverty in the passage does not imply any specific nationality. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and the passage explicitly states that \"53% of the population lives below the poverty line\", so the answer is 53%.\nThe answer: 53%", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Kenyans for Kenya initiative", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between Kenya and the other countries in the African Great Lakes region. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of country and industry. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of names in the answer. \nThe answer: Kenya", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Since the question asks for the percentage of GDP that manufacturing accounts for, and the passage states that manufacturing accounts for only 14% of the GDP, the answer is 14%.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that industrial activity is concentrated around the three largest urban centres, Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu.\nThe answer: Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The sector known as Jua Kali engages in small-scale manufacturing of household goods, motor-vehicle parts, and farm implements. This answer is found in the last sentence of the passage, which mentions the Jua Kali sector and the types of products they manufacture.\nThe answer: small-scale manufacturing of household goods, motor-vehicle parts, and farm implements.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Kenya's inclusion in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has given a boost to manufacturing in recent years. This is a concept of trade and economics, which falls under the rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts (rule 5) and is not related to size, shape, age, or color (rule 3).\nThe answer: Kenya's inclusion in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)", "{1, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year in which AGOA took effect. This information is directly stated in the passage without any need for inference or interpretation. Therefore, rules related to comparison, synonyms, irrelevant information, and gender are not relevant. The answer is not affected by typos or contractions. The relevant rules are that first comes before last and negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: 2000", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and the rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts are not relevant to this question. The answer is found in the passage stating that the largest share of Kenya's electricity supply comes from hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper Tana River and the Turkwel Gorge Dam in the west.\nThe answer: hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper Tana River and the Turkwel Gorge Dam in the west.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the hydroelectric stations are located along the upper Tana River and the Turkwel Gorge Dam is in the west. \nThe answer: along the upper Tana River and in the west.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The establishment of the Kenya Electricity Generating Company is a past event that occurred before the time frame of the article. Therefore, the rule of chronological order (16) applies. Additionally, the sentence structure indicates that the establishment of the company is the subject of the sentence and the action being taken, making it a passive sentence. Therefore, the rule of passive sentences (23) also applies.\nThe answer: 1997", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that Kenya has proven deposits of oil in Turkana. \nThe answer: Turkana", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size is a different concept from other properties means that the size of the oil reserves is not related to the amount of imports or the economy. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B means that if Tullow Oil estimates Kenya's oil reserves to be around 10 billion barrels, then it can be inferred that Kenya has at least 10 billion barrels of oil. \nThe answer: 10 billion barrels", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: Kenya is still exploring to determine if there are more oil reserves.\nThe answer: Exploration is still continuing to determine if there are more reserves.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"percentages are different concepts\" (rule 3) and the rule that \"if A is X, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" (rule 8) apply here. The answer is \"20% to 25%\".", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Chinese investment in Kenya ... reached $474 million\", which means that China's investment in Kenya is $474 million.\nThe answer: $474 million", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the meaning of China's investment for Kenya, which implies that the answer should describe the impact or significance of the investment. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size and shape are different, so the answer cannot simply state the amount of the investment. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer can be phrased as \"China's investment is significant for Kenya\" or \"China's investment has a major impact on Kenya.\" \nThe answer: China's investment is significant for Kenya.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: gain support for a planned railway and dam", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Kenyan coastal town of Kilifi", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: environmental and social problems caused by China", "{1, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The article mentions that in 2007, the Kenyan government unveiled Vision 2030, an economic development programme. \nThe answer: an economic development programme", "{1, 4, 12}\nExplanation: Vision 2030 is an economic development program launched by the Kenyan government in 2007 with the goal of making the country a major player in the global economy by 2030.\nThe answer: An economic development program", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Vision 2030", "{rule list: 1, 2, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the reason why Vision 2030 added the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP). Rule 1 applies because it compares the situation before and after the addition of the NCCAP. Rule 2 applies because it compares the level of importance of climate change in Vision 2030 and the NCCAP. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of economic development and climate change. Rule 17 applies because it considers negations in the question. \nThe answer: Climate was initially omitted as a key development issue in Vision 2030, so the NCCAP was added to address this oversight.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, but the mention of the Ministry of Planning, National Development, and Vision 2030 indicates that the question is asking about a profession-related concept. First comes before last and last comes after first, so the mention of the Medium Term Plan being launched in the coming months indicates that it will come after the launch of the National Climate Change Action Plan. Therefore, the renewed Medium Term Plan will create the framework for the Action Plan to work. \nThe answer: renewed Medium Term Plan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: agriculture", "{3, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to find the percentage of girls in prostitution in certain coastal areas of Kenya. The passage states that \"UNICEF estimated that up to 30% of girls in the coastal areas of Malindi, Mombasa, Kilifi, and Diani were subject to prostitution.\" Therefore, the answer is 30%. \nThe answer: 30%", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"most of the prostitutes in Kenya are aged 9-18.\" This means that the age range of most prostitutes in Kenya is between 9 and 18 years old.\nThe answer: 9-18", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules state that professions and nationalities are different concepts, and that negations are important for the answer. The passage states that poverty, lack of access to education, and weak government institutions are causes of child labor. Therefore, the answer is NOT having access to education, having weak government institutions, and living in poverty. \nThe answer: poverty, lack of access to education, weak government institutions", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Kenya has various ethnic groups that speak their mother tongues, but the two official languages are English and Swahili. Therefore, the answer is English and Swahili.\nThe answer: English and Swahili", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that Kenya's various ethnic groups typically speak their mother tongues within their own communities, but the two official languages, English and Swahili, are used in varying degrees of fluency for communication with other populations. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply. \nThe answer: English and Swahili.", "{1, 2, 3, 7}\nExplanation: English is widely spoken in commerce, schooling, and government, indicating that it is used the most in urban areas and for official purposes. Native languages are more commonly spoken in rural areas. Kenyan English, a distinct local dialect, is also used by some communities and individuals in the country. \nThe answer: in commerce, schooling, and government", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts implies that the location where British English is used is not relevant to the answer. The rule that language and nationality are different concepts implies that the fact that Kenya is the country being discussed is not relevant to the answer. Therefore, the answer is: in the country.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule about profession and nationality being different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule about size, shape, age, and color being different concepts is also not relevant. The main religion in Kenya is being asked, so the rule about animals and vehicles being different concepts is also not relevant. The relevant rules are that religion and nationality are different concepts, and that the majority is the answer. \nThe answer: Christianity", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also not relevant.

The negation in the question (\"non-religious\") is important to note. \nThe answer: 2.4%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size and religion are different concepts, so we can ignore the percentages of other faiths. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can rephrase the question as \"What percent of the population in Kenya's Coastal Region is Muslim?\" The answer is 60%. \n\nThe answer: 60%", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Sizeable minorities of other faiths exist in Kenya, but the western areas of the Coast Region are mostly Christian. The negation in the question (\"mostly\") is important for the answer. \nThe answer: Christian.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size and religion are different concepts, nationalities and religions are different concepts, question contains synonym \"Hindu population\", irrelevant information about Muslim population and regions, negation in the question is important.\nThe answer: around 300,000", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Nurses are mentioned as treating 80% of the population who visit dispensaries, health centres, and private clinics in rural and under-served urban areas. This indicates that they treat the majority of the population medically. Rule 1 applies because \"majority\" implies a comparison, and rule 3 applies because \"majority\" refers to the number of people treated, which is a different concept than the profession of the medical workers. \nThe answer: Nurses", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Nurses treat most of the population, but complicated cases are referred to clinical officers, medical officers, and medical practitioners.\nThe answer: clinical officers, medical officers, and medical practitioners", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The number of registered nurses in Kenya in 2011 is explicitly stated in the article.\nThe answer: 65,000", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 2011, there were 7,000 doctors in Kenya.\nThe answer: 7,000", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Diseases of poverty", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Half of Kenyans", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that preventable diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malnutrition are the biggest burden and major child-killers. The use of \"biggest burden\" indicates that these diseases are the most significant problem. The rules used are 3 (to differentiate between concepts), 8 (to understand that \"biggest burden\" means the most significant problem), and 17 (to recognize that negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malnutrition", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that weak policies, corruption, inadequate health workers, weak management, and poor leadership in the public health sector are largely to blame for the burdens in health care in Kenya. This relates to rules 3 and 4, which state that profession and nationality are different concepts and that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 8 also applies, as the question asks for what is to blame, which is a negation. \nThe answer: weak policies, corruption, inadequate health workers, weak management, and poor leadership in the public health sector", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 15 million", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer is a person who introduced the first system of education in Kenya. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be \"British colonists\" as they are a nationality, not a person. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"British colonists\" cannot be the answer as they were not a person who introduced the system. The answer is therefore not explicitly stated in the article.\nThe answer: The article does not provide the name of the person who introduced the first system of education in Kenya.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific date, which is not provided in the article. However, the article does provide the information that Kenya gained independence on December 12, 1963.\nThe answer: December 12, 1963", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Ominde Commission", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The Ominde Commission was formed after Kenya's independence to introduce changes to the education system that would reflect the nation's sovereignty. The answer is: \"introduce changes to the education system to reflect national cohesion.\"", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Between 1964 and 1985, the 7\u20134\u20132\u20133 system was adopted \u2013 seven years of primary, four years of lower secondary, two years of upper secondary, and three years of university.\" This indicates that the 7-4-2-3 system was adopted for education.\nThe answer: 7-4-2-3 system", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: look at both the possibilities of setting up a second university in Kenya as well as the reforming of the entire education system.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The committee recommended changing the 7-4-2-3 system to an 8-4-4 system.\nThe answer: an 8-4-4 system", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage states that the current education system in Kenya is the 8-4-4 system, which consists of eight years in primary school, four years in secondary school, and four years in university education. This is a different system from the previous 7-4-2-3 system. \nThe answer: 8-4-4", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the last batch of students from the former system graduated from Kenyan Universities in 1992, indicating that this was the year of their graduation.\nThe answer: 1992", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The 8-4-4 system was launched in January 1985.\nThe answer: January 1985.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. The emphasis was on vocational subjects, which means that the emphasis was less on academic subjects. Therefore, the answer is: less emphasis on academic subjects.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the 8-4-4 system put more emphasis on vocational subjects, implying that they were considered more important than other subjects. Therefore, we can infer that non-vocational subjects were less important. \nThe answer: To enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment in the informal sector.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: January 2003", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: about 70%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that age comes before education (rule 16) tells us that the answer will be an age. The rule that age is a different concept from education (rule 3) tells us that the answer will not include any mention of primary or high school. \nThe answer: six years", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies to the breakdown of years in primary and high school, as 8 years in primary school is more than 4 years in high school. Rule 3 applies to the breakdown of years in vocational training and higher education, as they involve different concepts (learning a trade vs. obtaining a diploma/degree). \nThe answer: 6 years of basic formal education (8 years in primary school, 4 years in high school/secondary school), followed by vocational training or higher education.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Students who exit primary school can join a vocational youth/village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring, carpentry, motor vehicle repair, brick-laying and masonry for about two years.\nThe answer: Join a vocational youth/village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Completing high school allows students to join a polytechnic or technical college for three years or proceed directly to university for four years. They can also obtain a specialized higher diploma qualification after a further one to two years of training, which is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor's degree, and direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies is possible in some universities.\nThe answer: join a polytechnic or technical college, proceed directly to university, obtain a specialized higher diploma qualification, and have direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies in some universities.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the country's literacy level stands at 85% of the whole population.\" This means that 85% of the population is literate.\nThe answer: 85%", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Preschool targets children from age three to five, as stated in the article.\nThe answer: age three to five", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Preschool is a key requirement for admission to Standard One (First Grade). This means that without completing preschool, a child cannot be admitted to First Grade. Therefore, preschool is required for admission to First Grade.\nThe answer: admission to First Grade", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The KCPE determines which students will proceed to secondary school or vocational training.\nThe answer: those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"For those who proceed to secondary level, there is a national examination at the end of Form Four \u2013 the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE).\" This indicates that the exam at the end of Form Four is the KCSE.\nThe answer: the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE)", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the Kenya National Library Service (KNLS) is the body mandated to lead the National and Public Library Services. This falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Kenya National Library Service (KNLS)", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The Kenya National Library Service (KNLS) is mandated to establish, equip, manage and maintain national and public libraries in the country.\nThe answer: establishing, equipping, managing, and maintaining national and public libraries in the country.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and \"names are equally important for the answer.\" The passage states that \"A public library is seen as a peoples university since it is open to all irrespective of age, literacy level and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life.\" This implies that the public library is seen as a place of education and learning for all Kenyans, regardless of their background or level of education. \nThe answer: a peoples university", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The public library is open to all, regardless of age or literacy level, and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life, making it accessible and inclusive like a university. Additionally, the term \"university\" implies a place of learning and education, which the public library also provides. \nThe answer: It is open to all irrespective of age, literacy level and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life.", "{4, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of nationality being considered a sport. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of vehicles being considered a sport. \nThe answer: cricket, rallying, football, rugby union, boxing, middle-distance and long-distance athletics.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for what the country is known for, implying that it is more known for this than other things. Rule 3 applies because \"known for\" refers to reputation, which is different from the specific sports listed in the article. \nThe answer: dominance in middle-distance and long-distance athletics", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Kenyan athletes, particularly Kalenjin, continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from Morocco and Ethiopia has reduced this supremacy.\nThe answer: Kenyan athletes, particularly Kalenjin.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for countries that compete with Kenya in long distance running, which implies a comparison of performance. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any options related to those factors. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that Morocco and Ethiopia are the countries that have reduced Kenya's dominance in long distance running. \nThe answer: Morocco and Ethiopia", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Kenya won six gold medals, which means that other nations won less than six gold medals.\nThe answer: six", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Kenya won six gold, four silver, and four bronze medals in the Beijing Olympics, making it Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics.

Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which means that an athlete's nationality can be changed. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which means that the reason for the controversy is because of the athletes leaving Kenya to represent other countries, not because of any positive reasons. \nThe answer: Athletes have defected to represent other countries, chiefly Bahrain and Qatar, due to economic or financial factors.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: economic or financial factors", "{3, 4, 5, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks about a sport dominated by Kenyan women, so rules 3, 4, and 5 are relevant to ensure that the answer is about a sport and not a profession or nationality.

Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore information about the country and focus on the sport. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the captain's name will come after the mention of the team. Rules 20 and 21 state that \"he\" refers to male names and \"his\" refers to male names, so we can assume that the captain is male. \nThe answer: Rakep Patel", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: March 2007", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Kenya is known for hosting the Safari Rally, which is considered one of the toughest rallies in the world and has been won by some of the best rally drivers in the world.\nThe answer: the Safari Rally", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: one of the toughest rallies in the world", "{3, 4, 5, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant.

The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" allows us to rephrase the question as \"What are some normal foods eaten for breakfast in Kenya?\".\nThe answer: tea or porridge with bread, chapati, mahamri, boiled sweet potatoes or yams.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Ugali with vegetables, sour milk, meat, fish or any other stew is generally eaten by much of the population for lunch or supper.\" This indicates that the same type of food is eaten for both lunch and supper.\nThe answer: Ugali with vegetables, sour milk, meat, fish or any other stew", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different. These rules are not directly relevant to this question, but they help to eliminate any confusion about what the IPCC is. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is relevant because the article mentions that the IPCC was first established in 1988 by the WMO and UNEP. \nThe answer: The IPCC is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the United Nations, set up at the request of member governments, and was first established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that the IPCC was established by two United Nations organizations, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The relevant rules are 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first).\nThe answer: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The UN wants to stabilize \"greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interference with the climate system.\" The negation in the question (\"what does the UN want to stabilize?\") and the use of the word \"prevent\" indicate the importance of rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 3 is also relevant as it emphasizes that concepts such as \"greenhouse gas concentrations\" are different from concepts such as \"the atmosphere.\" \nThe answer: greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere", "{3, 4, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the UN's climate change treaty, which is mentioned in the passage as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Rules 3, 4, and 5 are relevant because they establish that concepts such as treaties and organizations are different from concepts such as age and color, and that professions and nationalities are different concepts. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer, and the question specifically asks for the name of the treaty. \nThe answer: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Resolution 43/53", "{rule list: 14, 20}\nExplanation: The article states that Hoesung Lee is the current chair of the IPCC, and specifies that he is a Korean economist. \nThe answer: Hoesung Lee", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: Nationality is a different concept from profession, so rule 4 applies. The article explicitly states that Hoesung Lee is a \"Korean economist,\" so we can extract his nationality as Korean.\nThe answer: Korean", "{rule list: 4, 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that before Hoesung Lee became the chair of the IPCC, the organization was led by his vice-chair Ismail El Gizouli, who was designated acting Chair after the resignation of Rajendra K. Pachauri in February 2015. Therefore, the answer is Ismail El Gizouli.\nThe answer: Ismail El Gizouli", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us determine that the first chair of the IPCC was Bert Bolin, who was elected in 1988. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence \"The previous chairs were Rajendra K. Pachauri, elected in May 2002; Robert Watson in 1997; and Bert Bolin in 1988\" is in the passive voice, and that the subject of the sentence is \"previous chairs\" and the verb is \"were.\" \nThe answer: Bert Bolin", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that Pachauri was the previous chair before the current one, Hoesung Lee. We use rule 23 to understand that the sentence is in the passive voice, meaning that Pachauri was acted upon by the verb \"resign.\" \nThe answer: February 2015.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The IPCC Panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations, so rule 4 applies to distinguish between profession and nationality.

Rule 16 applies to distinguish between the order of first and last names. \nThe answer: representatives appointed by governments and organizations", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 350", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that the IPCC Panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations, and that participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged. Non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations may attend as observers, and attendance at other sessions is by invitation only. Therefore, the people who attend IPCC meetings are government representatives, experts, and invited individuals from organizations. \nThe answer: government representatives, experts, and invited individuals from organizations", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to determine the percentage of attendees at the IPCC meeting who were government representatives. Rule 3 tells us that size and quantity are different concepts, so we cannot use the exact numbers given in the article. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What percentage of attendees at the IPCC meeting were not government representatives?\" From the article, we know that about seven-eighths of participants were from governmental organizations, so the answer is 1/8 or 12.5%. \nThe answer: 12.5%", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the passage, which states that the IPCC Trust Fund was established in 1989.\nThe answer: 1989", "{rule list: 13, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity that started the IPCC Trust Fund, which is a specific organization. Therefore, rules 13 and 16 are relevant to ensure that names and locations are important for the answer. Additionally, rule 23 is relevant because the question is in the passive voice, so the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Costs of the Secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the WMO, while UNEP meets the cost of the Depute Secretary.\" This means that the UNEP funds the Deputy Secretary.\nThe answer: UNEP", "{3, 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the IPCC is required to comply with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO, which implies that they have rules to follow. Additionally, the mention of \"annual budget\" suggests that there are financial rules in place. The rules selected are: 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 16 (first comes before last), and 23 (compliance with rules). \nThe answer: The IPCC is required to comply with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the WMO.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that the costs of the Secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the WMO, which is a professional organization for meteorology and climatology. Therefore, the answer is the WMO.\nThe answer: the WMO", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that the IPCC does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data. This is a negation, which is important to note according to rule 17. Additionally, this question involves the concept of what the IPCC does not do, which falls under the category of different concepts according to rule 3. Finally, the question does not involve any names or locations, so rules 13 and 14 are not relevant. \nThe answer: The IPCC does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the source of information, which is a comparison between peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the type of information being discussed is different from concepts like size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: IPCC reports get their information from published sources, with priority given to peer-reviewed sources. Non-peer-reviewed sources may also be used if they are of sufficient quality.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Grey literature refers to non-peer-reviewed sources, such as reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals. These sources may be used by authors of IPCC reports if they are of sufficient quality. \nThe answer: Non-peer-reviewed sources", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The IPCC may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources, such as model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals, provided that they are of sufficient quality.\nThe answer: model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is also not relevant. The answer can be found by applying rules 3 and 4, which state that coordinating lead authors and lead authors are different concepts. The passage states that a chapter typically has two coordinating lead authors, so the answer is 2. \n\nThe answer: 2", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" applies because the passage states that a chapter typically has two \"coordinating lead authors\", ten to fifteen \"lead authors\", and a somewhat larger number of \"contributing authors\". The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the question asks for the number of lead authors, and the passage provides the range of ten to fifteen lead authors. \nThe answer: ten to fifteen", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The relevant rules are that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and \"animals and vehicles are different concepts.\" The question asks about the number of contributing authors in an IPCC report chapter, which is a numerical concept and not related to size, shape, age, or color. It is also not related to animals or vehicles. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are not applicable. The answer is \"a somewhat larger number.\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 and 23. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that coordinating lead authors come before lead authors and contributing authors. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that the answer will likely be in the passive voice. Therefore, the answer is: \"The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors.\"", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The relevant rules are that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\", as they do not apply to the concepts of authors and reporting. The answer is: the coordinating lead authors report to the Working Group chairs.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that human activities are \"substantially increasing\" the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Rule 3 applies because \"increasing atmospheric concentrations\" is different from the concept of \"greenhouse gases.\" Rule 8 applies because the article states that CO2 is responsible for \"over half\" of the enhanced greenhouse effect, implying that other factors also contribute. \nThe answer: substantially increasing their atmospheric concentrations", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that increased greenhouse gases result in an additional warming of the Earth's surface. Rule 3 applies because size, shape, and age are not relevant concepts in this context. \nThe answer: increased warming of the Earth's surface", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that CO2 is responsible for over half of the enhanced greenhouse effect, which means that other factors contribute to the rest. Rule 2 applies because the article uses the phrase \"responsible for\" to indicate that CO2 is the most significant contributor to the greenhouse effect. \nThe answer: over half", "{3, 7, 11}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a scenario, which is a specific concept. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate rules related to those concepts. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"scenario\" in the passage. Rule 11 states that contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the contraction \"don't\". \nThe answer: \"business as usual\" (BAU) scenario", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 8 is relevant because the question asks about the amount of change in temperature, which is a comparison. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks about a negation. \nThe answer: 0.3 to 0.6 \u00b0C", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 17 (negations are important for the answer) and 22 (if two entities are listed, then \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last). The question asks for the year the joint statement on climate change was issued, so we need to look for a date. The passage does not provide a specific date, but it does mention that the joint statement was made in 2001. Therefore, the answer is 2001.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is a numerical value, which can be directly extracted from the text. Rule 3 is relevant to ensure that the phrase \"national science academies\" is not mistaken for a specific number. Rule 16 is relevant to ensure that the phrase \"joint statement\" is not mistaken for a separate endorsement. \nThe answer: 16", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the joint statement was published as an editorial in a journal. The names of several science academies are listed, but they are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Science", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The statement said that scientists were \"at least 90% certain\" that temperatures would continue to rise.\nThe answer: at least 90% certain", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The statement predicted that global surface temperature would increase by between 1.4 and 5.8 \u00b0C above 1990 levels by 2100.\nThe answer: between 1.4 and 5.8 \u00b0C", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Richard Lindzen", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Lindzen criticized that the Summary for Policymakers understates the uncertainty associated with climate models.\nThe answer: The Summary for Policymakers understates the uncertainty associated with climate models.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: John Houghton responded to Lindzen's criticisms, as stated in the passage. This answer is not affected by the person's gender (rule 19) or the use of contractions (rule 11).\nThe answer: John Houghton", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Houghton was a co-chair of TAR WGI.\nThe answer: co-chair of TAR WGI", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Houghton stated that any changes to the SPM must be supported by scientific evidence.\nThe answer: scientific evidence", "{1, 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it mentions the comparison of two things (Assessment Reports and Special Reports). Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts (Assessment Reports and Special Reports). Rule 12 applies because it mentions irrelevant information (the specific topics of the Special Reports). Rule 17 applies because it mentions the negation \"same procedures.\" \nThe answer: The preparation and approval process for all IPCC Special Reports follows different procedures than for IPCC Assessment Reports.", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) was finalized in the year 2011. Rule 2 applies because \"finalized\" is a synonym for \"issued\". Rule 16 applies because \"finalized\" implies that the report was completed and ready for release. \nThe answer: 2011.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when the report was issued, which is a passive construction. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Therefore, we need to look for a negation in the sentence and invert the verb and subject to get the answer. The sentence \"Both Special Reports were requested by governments\" needs to be inverted to \"Governments requested both Special Reports.\" The answer is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that the report was issued in 2011, the same year as the other Special Report mentioned in the article.\nThe answer: 2011", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Both Special Reports were requested by governments.\" This indicates that the reason for issuing the 2011 Special Reports was because they were requested by governments.\nThe answer: They were requested by governments.", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for other activities required by the UNFCCC, which is mentioned in the passage. Rules 3 and 4 remind us that different concepts (such as the IPCC's tasks and the UNFCCC's requirements) should not be confused. Rule 7 reminds us that synonyms may be used in the question. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important. \nThe answer: Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts.\nThe answer: Default emission factors.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that emission factors are derived based on the levels of fuel consumption, industrial production, and other factors.\nThe answer: fuel consumption, industrial production, and other factors", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council assign tasks to the IPCC.\nThe answer: The WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The date of 2035 (for the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers) was incorrect.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance", "{rule list: 7, 17}\nExplanation: The mistake was due to a misquoting of a source by the WWF report.\nThe answer: misquoting of a source by the WWF report.", "{7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the report that had the correct date. The answer is \"ICSI report 'Variations of Snow and Ice in the past and at present on a Global and Regional Scale'\". Rule 7 applies because \"name\" and \"report\" are synonyms in this context. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"not\" which is important for the answer.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Former chairman", "{rule list: 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the direction of the mistake, which implies a comparison between the actual impact and the overstated impact. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the direction of the mistake, which is a negation. \nThe answer: The mistake went in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Martin Parry was a co-chair of the IPCC working group II.\nThe answer: co-chair of the IPCC working group II", "{rule list: 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the topic of the error, which is a negation. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"error\" can be replaced with \"mistake\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for the opposite of the topic of the error. \nThe answer: climate change impact", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question specifically asks for the verdict on \"other alleged mistakes,\" implying that there was already a mistake made regarding Himalayan glaciers. Rules 17 and 18 state that negations and negations in the question are important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is that the other alleged mistakes were \"generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment.\"", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The question asks for the publication date of the paper that the \"Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction\" graph was based on. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can ignore any information about the age of the graph or the events it depicts. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"publication date\" in the article. The answer: 1999.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Michael E. Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: hockey stick graph", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: reconstructions by Jones et al. 1998, Pollack, Huang & Shen 1998, Crowley & Lowery 2000 and Briffa 2000", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1000 to 1900", "{rule list: 4, 8, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the leader of the Science and Environmental Policy Project, which is a profession and therefore different from nationality or location. Additionally, the question contains a comparison using \"contrarians,\" which requires the use of antonyms. Finally, names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Fred Singer", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of Singer's press conference, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the location, not the topic of the press conference. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"in May 2000 Fred Singer's Science and Environmental Policy Project held a press event on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.\" is in the active voice, so we can extract the answer directly from it.\nThe answer: Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.", "{rule list: 3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when Singer disputed the graph at a Senate hearing. The passage mentions that Singer and Karl\u00e9n disputed the finding in May 2000 and that Singer argued against the graph at a Senate hearing on July 18, 2000. Rules 3 and 16 help eliminate irrelevant information about the controversy surrounding the \"hockey stick graph\" and the Bush administration's response. Rule 8 helps understand that Singer's dispute is an antonym of the finding presented in the studies. Rule 17 helps identify that the negation in the question is important for the answer.\nThe answer: July 18, 2000.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that the first name mentioned in the passage is the one we are looking for. Rule 23 helps us understand that the subject of a passive sentence is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: Rep. Joe Barton", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Ed Whitfield", "{1, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a specific date, and the passage provides a date. Rule 10 applies because typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 applies because some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"when did they not demand\") which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: June 23, 2005", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person who was the chairman of the House Science Committee. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Sherwood Boehlert is the person we are looking for. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can ignore the passive sentence \"at his request the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation\" and focus on the active sentence \"Sherwood Boehlert, chairman of the House Science Committee, said this was a 'misguided and illegitimate investigation' apparently aimed at intimidating scientists\". \nThe answer: Sherwood Boehlert", "{7, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who criticized Barton's investigation. Rule 7 is relevant because the answer may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Rule 17 is relevant because negations are important for the answer. Rule 23 is relevant because the answer is found in a passive sentence. \nThe answer: Sherwood Boehlert", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2001", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2007", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"analysis of the Medieval Warm Period cited reconstructions by Crowley & Lowery 2000 (as cited in the TAR) and Osborn & Briffa 2006.\" Therefore, there were two Medieval Warm Period reconstructions mentioned. However, the passage also states that \"ten of these 14 reconstructions covered 1,000 years or longer,\" indicating that both of the Medieval Warm Period reconstructions covered 1,000+ years.\nThe answer: 2", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the \"divergence problem\" affecting certain tree ring data.\nThe answer: The tree ring data had a divergence problem.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: two", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The question asks for the date of a study that confirmed the 2001 IPCC projections. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a positive statement about the study. Rule 22 tells us that \"former\" refers to the first entity and \"latter\" to the last, but since there are only two entities mentioned in the passage (the 2001 IPCC report and the study), this rule is not relevant. \nThe answer: February 1, 2007", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a comparison between the 2001 IPCC report and reality for the years 2001-2006. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"compared,\" which implies a comparison. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a comparison between the 2001 IPCC report and reality, which is a comparison of two things. \nThe answer: The actual temperature rise and sea level rise were at or above the maximum rates proposed by the 2001 IPCC report.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a comparison between the 2001 IPCC report and reality, which implies a comparison between two things. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about how the report compares to reality, which implies a comparison of the two. \nThe answer: The actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCC's 2001 projection.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the IPCC projection.\" This means that the sea level rise in reality was more than what was projected in the 2001 IPCC report. Therefore, according to rule 1, the answer is that the 2001 IPCC report projected sea level rise to be less than what actually occurred. \nThe answer: The actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the 2001 IPCC projection.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the IPCC underestimated the projected rises in sea levels. According to rule 1, if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, the danger that the IPCC understated is the rise in sea levels. \nThe answer: Rise in sea levels.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the IPCC Third Assessment Report projected a rise in sea levels from 9-88 cm from 1990 to 2100. Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what is stated in the article. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the specific value stated in the article.\nThe answer: 9-88 cm", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what was projected by the IPCC. Rule 8 applies because the answer requires the use of antonyms. \nThe answer: 0.5-1.4 meters (50-140 cm) above 1990 levels.", "{rule list: 10, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific piece of information, which is the publication date of the Third Assessment Report. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant, so we can ignore the fact that \"when\" is used instead of \"what year\". Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant, so we can skip the parts about sea level rise and the IPCC's projections. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so we can assume that the Third Assessment Report was published before the study mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: 2001", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Coordinating lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Names are equally important for the answer, and negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: Science Magazine", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Oppenheimer advocated for smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach used in previous IPCC assessment reports, due to limitations of the consensus approach. \nThe answer: smaller assessments of special problems", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for something that has successfully dealt with ozone depletion, so we can infer that there was a problem with ozone depletion. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answer choices that mention these concepts. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answer choices that mention these concepts. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"successfully\" in the question. The answer is the Montreal Protocol. \n\nThe answer: The Montreal Protocol.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The Kyoto Protocol tried to address climate change.\nThe answer: climate change.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"states and governments still follow different, if not opposing goals.\" This indicates that the goals of governments often oppose the goals of the IPCC.\nThe answer: governments", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sheldon Ungar", "{3, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the failure of the Kyoto Protocol is due to \"varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions.\" This implies that the unsolved problems with the Kyoto Protocol are related to conflicts over the distribution of emission reductions. The rules used are 3 (distinguishing between concepts), 7 (synonyms in the question), 8 (antonyms), and 17 (negations). \nThe answer: conflicts over the distribution of emission reductions", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts.\nThe answer: regional burden sharing conflicts", "{rule list: 3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity that ordered the Stern Review. Rule 3 states that age, shape, size, and color are different concepts, so the gender of the entity is irrelevant. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the entity is also irrelevant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that \"the UK government\" refers to the entity that ordered the Stern Review.\nThe answer: The UK government.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rules of 3 and 4 are relevant because they state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 17 is also relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is: \"the IPCC does not carry out its own research, it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies.\"", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about what can be omitted, which is the opposite of what can be included. Rule 7 applies because \"omitted\" is a synonym of \"not included\". Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"cannot be included\". \nThe answer: significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the IPCC is \"widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science\" of climate change.\nThe answer: IPCC", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of scientists who called to change the IPCC in Feb 2010. The relevant information is that \"five climate scientists\" wrote in the journal Nature calling for changes to the IPCC. This is a passive sentence, so we need to identify the subject (five climate scientists) and the verb (wrote). Therefore, we apply rules 17 and 23 to get the answer.\nThe answer: five", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: journal Nature", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a proposal to let the IPCC respond to new evidence faster. The relevant sentence in the article is \"even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated 'living' Wikipedia-IPCC.\" This proposal suggests using a more dynamic and constantly updated platform, like Wikipedia, to allow for faster responses to new evidence. The rules used are 3 (to distinguish between concepts like proposals and evidence), 7 (to identify synonyms like \"respond\" and \"changes\"), and 17 (to recognize the importance of negations in the question). \nThe answer: turning the climate science assessment process into a moderated \"living\" Wikipedia-IPCC.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Size and shape are different concepts, so the answer should not include any information about the size of the IPCC. The question asks how to avoid political problems, which is a negation, so negations are important for the answer. The answer is \"remove government oversight from its processes.\"", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the main role of chloroplasts is to conduct photosynthesis. Rule 3 applies because the article mentions that chloroplasts also carry out other functions, but the primary purpose is photosynthesis. \nThe answer: Conduct photosynthesis.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts store energy in the energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH.\nThe answer: energy", "{3, 4, 5, 6}\nExplanation: The question asks for the function of NADPH, which is a concept related to the process of photosynthesis. Therefore, rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 are relevant as they establish that concepts such as function and process are different from size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles. The answer is: energy. \nThe answer: energy.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The article explains that chloroplasts use ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the Calvin cycle. The negation rule (17) is relevant because the question asks for the name of the process, and the answer is the name of the process. The shape rule (3) and the profession rule (4) are not relevant to this question.\nThe answer: the Calvin cycle.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts' main role is to conduct photosynthesis. The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from 1 in algae up to 100 in plants like Arabidopsis and wheat.\nThe answer: 1", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: occasionally pinch in two", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts' behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity.\nThe answer: light color and intensity", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Both chloroplasts and mitochondria contain their own DNA and are inherited by daughter cells during cell division.\nThe answer: They both contain their own DNA and are inherited by daughter cells during cell division.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the ancestor of chloroplasts was a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell.\nThe answer: a photosynthetic cyanobacterium", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: Plants cannot make chloroplasts themselves, so they must inherit them during cell division.\nThe answer: Chloroplasts must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.", "{3, 6, 20}\nExplanation: The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts eliminates the possibility of chloroplasts being found in animals. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts also eliminates the possibility of chloroplasts being found in vehicles. The rule that \"they\" refers to the last mentioned noun eliminates the need to repeat \"plants and algae\" in the answer.\nThe answer: Plants and algae.", "{rule list: 13, 19}\nExplanation: Names and nationalities are important for the answer, but a person's gender is irrelevant to their nationality.\nThe answer: Russian", "{rule list: 4, 13, 16}\nExplanation: Mereschkowski was a Russian biologist who first suggested the origin of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis in 1905.\nThe answer: biologist", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1905", "{rule list: 3, 23}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts are considered to have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis, and this origin was first suggested by Konstantin Mereschkowski in 1905.\nThe answer: Konstantin Mereschkowski", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that chloroplasts are descended from cyanobacteria is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that chloroplasts came after cyanobacteria. \nThe answer: cyanobacteria", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Cyanobacteria are classified as bacteria, which are different from animals and vehicles (rule 5) and their classification is based on their biological characteristics, specifically their prokaryotic cell structure (rule 3).\nThe answer: bacteria", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Gram-negative refers to bacteria that have two cell membranes, with a thin layer of peptidoglycan in between. This is in contrast to gram-positive bacteria, which have a thick layer of peptidoglycan and only one cell membrane. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 are relevant. \nThe answer: having two cell membranes", "{3}\nExplanation: Cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan cell wall, which is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria, and which is located between their two cell membranes.\nThe answer: peptidoglycan", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Cyanobacteria are sometimes called blue-green algae, but this is a wrong description because they are prokaryotes, not algae.\nThe answer: as blue-green algae", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Cyanobacteria entered an early eukaryotic cell.\nThe answer: eukaryotic cell.", "{rule list: 3, 10}\nExplanation: Cyanobacteria entered a cell \"somewhere around a billion years ago\", which is the same as \"around a billion years ago\".\nThe answer: Around a billion years ago.", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" is relevant because the question asks for what surrounds chloroplasts, so we can infer that chloroplasts are surrounded by something. The answer is \"two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes.\"", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, but the article mentions the membrane from the host, which is a different concept from the membranes that surround all chloroplasts. \nThe answer: The phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Cyanobacteria was assimilated into an early eukaryotic cell, providing food for the host and becoming an advantage. Over time, many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host, and some of its proteins were synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell and imported back into the chloroplast. Therefore, when cyanobacteria was assimilated, its genes were lost or transferred to the host's nucleus. \nThe answer: Many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: 'Plastid' in this context means almost the same thing as chloroplast.\nThe answer: almost the same thing as chloroplast", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that there are three chloroplast lineages - the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage, the rhodophyte or red algal chloroplast lineage, and the chloroplastidan or green chloroplast lineage. Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession, so we can infer that the different chloroplast lineages are distinguished by their color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage is the smallest of the three. \nThe answer: 3 (three)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: red algal chloroplast lineage", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: \"chloroplastidan\" is a term used to refer to the green chloroplast lineage. This falls under rule 3, which states that different concepts (in this case, chloroplast lineage) should be treated as separate, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the green chloroplast lineage is the one that contains the land plants.\" This means that the lineage that includes land plants is the chloroplastidan, or green chloroplast lineage.\nThe answer: green chloroplast lineage", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, and age. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the chloroplast lineage that Cyanophora is in, which is a concept related to taxonomy and not size, shape, or age. Therefore, rule 3 applies. The answer can be found by identifying the information in the passage that describes the chloroplast lineage of Cyanophora, which is the glaucophyte chloroplast group.", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Cyanophora is an alga, which is a type of organism that is different from animals and vehicles (rule 5) and is characterized by its plant-like features such as the ability to photosynthesize (rule 3).\nThe answer: an alga", "3, 8\nExplanation: \"muroplasts\" is a term used to refer to glaucophyte chloroplasts, which retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes, like their cyanobacterial parent. This is a unique feature that distinguishes them from chloroplasts in other organisms. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) applies to distinguish muroplasts from other types of chloroplasts, and rule 8 (antonyms) applies to understand that if glaucophyte chloroplasts have a peptidoglycan wall, then other chloroplasts do not have it. \nThe answer: Chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes, found in glaucophytes.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and thylakoids are a part of the structure of the chloroplast, which is a different concept from animals and vehicles.\nThe answer: a carboxysome", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the type of structure that a carboxysome is. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about those concepts is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that the article uses the word \"carboxysome\" is important. The answer is: an icosahedral structure.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rhodoplasts have both chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments, with the phycobilin phycoerytherin responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color. However, since they also contain the blue-green chlorophyll a and other pigments, many are reddish to purple from the combination. Therefore, the answer is chlorophyll a and phycobilins.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Phycobilin pigments are organized into phycobilisomes on the thylakoid membranes, which prevents their thylakoids from stacking. This follows rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph.\nThe answer: phycobilisomes", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is: the phycobilin pigment phycoerytherin.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Red algae have phycoerytherin pigment in their rhodoplasts, which helps them catch more sunlight in deep water. This is beneficial for their survival.\nThe answer: to help them catch more sunlight in deep water", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Floridean is a form of starch synthesized by rhodoplasts, which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast, in the cytoplasm of the red alga.\nThe answer: a form of starch", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 and 4, as they state that color and host organism (which is related to the concept of nationality) are different concepts. The article states that red algal chloroplasts differ from green chloroplasts in that they have phycobilisomes, while green chloroplasts have lost them and contain chlorophyll b instead. Therefore, the answer is phycobilisomes. \nThe answer: phycobilisomes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that most green chloroplasts are obviously green, but some forms of H\u00e6matococcus pluvialis aren't green due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls' green colors. Therefore, the answer is that some forms of H\u00e6matococcus pluvialis have accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls' green colors.", "{3}\nExplanation: Chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost their phycobilisomes and the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that some plants have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer, but they have been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead. \nThe answer: chloroplast division", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that green chloroplasts do not have phycobilisomes. \nThe answer: chlorophyll b", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Primary chloroplasts have a double membrane.\nThe answer: Double membrane", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the question. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if primary chloroplasts have a double membrane and secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two, then the answer is that secondary chloroplasts have more membranes. \nThe answer: Secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the secondary endosymbiotic event occurred when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it, resulting in the formation of a chloroplast with additional membranes. This is a process that occurred in the evolution of chloroplasts. \nThe answer: The process by which a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it, resulting in the formation of a chloroplast with additional membranes.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if primary chloroplasts have a double membrane and secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two, then primary chloroplasts have fewer membranes than secondary chloroplasts. Therefore, the answer is: three or four membranes.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it, the engulfed alga was broken down, leaving only its chloroplast, and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus, forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes. Therefore, the answer is \"only its chloroplast, and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus\". \nThe answer: only its chloroplast, and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Euglenophyte chloroplasts have three membranes and contain a pyrenoid and thylakoids stacked in groups of three is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if it is stated that Euglenophyte chloroplasts are derived from a green alga, then the answer is that they have green algal chloroplasts. \nThe answer: green algal chloroplasts", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Euglenophytes are a group of flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga.\nThe answer: flagellated protists", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that euglenophyte chloroplasts have thylakoids stacked in groups of three and a pyrenoid. \nThe answer: The thylakoids are stacked in groups of three and there is a pyrenoid.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Starch is stored in the form of paramylon\" in the cytoplasm of the euglenophyte.\nThe answer: Starch", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the primary endosymbiont membrane was lost, then the cyanobacterial membranes were retained. Therefore, the answer is the membrane of the primary endosymbiont. \nThe answer: primary endosymbiont membrane", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Cryptophytes are also known as cryptomonads.\nThe answer: Cryptomonads", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that cryptophytes have a red-algal derived chloroplast, then we can infer that they do not have a green-algal derived chloroplast. \nThe answer: cryptophytes have a red-algal derived chloroplast.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a similarity between two types of algae. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so those cannot be the similarity. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we rephrase the question as \"What part of chlorarachniophyte chloroplasts is similar to cryptophytes?\", we can use the fact that chlorarachniophytes are mentioned in the passage and find the answer. \nThe answer: The nucleomorph.", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that cryptophyte chloroplasts store ordinary starch in granules found in the periplastid space, which is outside the original double membrane. \nThe answer: In granules found in the periplastid space, outside the original double membrane.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The order of the information in the passage is relevant, as it states that \"Inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two.\" Therefore, the answer is: in stacks of two.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The article states that Apicomplexans are another group of chromalveolates, which implies that they are similar to chromalveolates.\nThe answer: chromalveolates", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Apicomplexans are a type of chromalveolates, which is a group of organisms that includes both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic species. This answer is concise and minimal, and follows rules 3 and 5 by not conflating the concepts of color and animals/vehicles, and by correctly identifying Apicomplexans as a type of organism rather than a profession or nationality. \nThe answer: chromalveolates", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the malaria parasite", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article explains that apicomplexans, a group of parasitic chromalveolates, keep a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast, which they inherited from their ancestors. \nThe answer: a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in amylopectin starch granules located in their cytoplasm", "{3, 5, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is not relevant either. However, the rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" is relevant because the question asks what apicoplasts synthesize, and the passage mentions that they synthesize fatty acids, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, iron-sulfur clusters, and carry out part of the heme pathway. Therefore, the answer is: fatty acids, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, iron-sulfur clusters, and part of the heme pathway.", "{3, 5, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that apicoplasts are an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the function of apicoplasts and chloroplasts. Rule 5 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and plants. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that drugs target apicoplasts for diseases. Rule 17 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: apicomplexan-related diseases", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the most important function of apicoplasts is isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis, and that interference with this function leads to the death of apicomplexans. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that different concepts (such as function and shape) should not be confused. Rule 8 is relevant because it tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use the antonym of \"important\" (which is \"unimportant\") to infer that if isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis is the most important thing apicoplasts do, then everything else they do is less important. \nThe answer: isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis", "{3}\nExplanation: Apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic function and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids.\nThe answer: photosynthetic function and photosynthetic pigments", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Apicoplasts are bounded by four membranes.\nThe answer: four", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if peridinin is found only in peridinin-type chloroplasts, then it is not found in any other group of chloroplasts. \nThe answer: peridinin", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Peridinin is a carotenoid pigment found in the chloroplasts of dinophytes. Since peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts, it can be inferred that it is unique to dinophytes. Therefore, the answer is \"in the chloroplasts of dinophytes.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"shape\" is a different concept from \"color\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the passage states that peridinin-type chloroplasts have \"triplet-stacked thylakoids\". Therefore, the answer is that the thylakoids are arranged in triplets. \nThe answer: triplet-stacked", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Peridinin-type chloroplasts are characterized by the carotenoid pigment peridinin in their chloroplasts, along with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2. They are bounded by three membranes (occasionally two), having lost the red algal endosymbiont's original cell membrane. Therefore, the answer is the red algal endosymbiont's original cell membrane. \nThe answer: the red algal endosymbiont's original cell membrane", "{rule list: 3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages, which include Karlodinium and Karenia. Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from other concepts, so the fact that Karlodinium is described as a \"fucoxanthin dinophyte\" is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Karlodinium is a type of dinophyte is not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that Karlodinium is specifically mentioned in the article is relevant. \nThe answer: Karlodinium is in the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineage.", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: Karenia is in the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineage.\nThe answer: fucoxanthin dinophyte", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the haptophyte chloroplast has four membranes, but after being heavily reduced, it is left with only its chloroplast (with its original double membrane), and possibly one or two additional membranes around it.\nThe answer: 4", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it distinguishes between the number of membranes in the chloroplast and other characteristics. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because it applies to the expected outcome of tertiary endosymbiosis. \nThe answer: a six membraned chloroplast", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Dinophysis obtained its chloroplasts from a cryptophyte, but it is not an endosymbiont. It is possible that the chloroplasts are kleptoplasts, which means that Dinophysis continually engulfs cryptophytes to obtain new chloroplasts. \nThe answer: a cryptophyte", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Dinophysis chloroplast has been stripped of its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes, leaving just a two-membraned chloroplast. This means that the chloroplast has lost its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes.\nThe answer: nucleomorph and outermost two membranes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article states that Dinophysis has a chloroplast taken from a cryptophyte, then the answer is that the chloroplast of Dinophysis is taken from a cryptophyte. \nThe answer: taken from a cryptophyte", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Dinophysis chloroplast has been stripped of its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes, leaving just a two-membraned chloroplast. This means that the chloroplast is missing some components and is not fully functional. \nThe answer: a two-membraned chloroplast", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions that diatoms are heterokontophytes, which are a type of algae. Therefore, diatoms can be considered a synonym for algae.\nThe answer: algae", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The article explains that Durinskia has a diatom-derived chloroplast, which means that the chloroplast comes from a different type of organism (a diatom) and is not native to Durinskia itself. Therefore, the answer is \"diatom-derived\". \nThe answer: diatom-derived", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that some dinophytes, including Durinskia, have chloroplasts that are derived from diatoms and are bounded by up to five membranes. Since the question asks specifically about Durinskia, we can assume that it has at least two membranes (one from the diatom and one from the dinophyte host), but it could have up to five. Therefore, we need to apply rule 3 to differentiate between the number of membranes in Durinskia's chloroplast and the number in other dinophytes. Rule 8 tells us that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can apply it to say that if some dinophytes have chloroplasts with up to five membranes, then Durinskia has at most five membranes. \nThe answer: up to five membranes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the chloroplasts in some dinophytes, including Durinskia, are bounded by up to five membranes, but it depends on whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it. Therefore, the number of membranes is sometimes but not always counted.\nThe answer: the entire diatom endosymbiont", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Starch is a type of food, which is a different concept from the structure or characteristics of the chloroplast or the endosymbiont. Therefore, we apply rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. \nThe answer: in granules in the dinophyte host's cytoplasm", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the nucleomorph genes are transferred to the dinophyte nucleus. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can infer that the transfer of nucleomorph genes is an active process. \nThe answer: the dinophyte nucleus", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article states that Lepidodinium viride is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast that's not from the rhodoplast lineage, then the answer is that Lepidodinium viride is the only dinophyte that has a non-rhodoplast chloroplast.\nThe answer: Lepidodinium viride", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that Lepidodinium viride \"lost their original peridinin chloroplast\" and replaced it with a green algal derived chloroplast.\nThe answer: Lepidodinium viride lost their original peridinin chloroplast.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Lepidodinium viride replaced their original peridinin chloroplast with a green algal derived chloroplast. Since the question asks for what they replaced it with, we can apply rule 3 to differentiate between the concepts of size, shape, age, and color, and rule 8 to handle the comparison between the original and the replacement. \nThe answer: a green algal derived chloroplast", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the definition of prasinophyte is not dependent on any of these. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the definition of prasinophyte is not dependent on any profession or nationality. The question asks for a definition, so synonyms and antonyms are not relevant. Therefore, rules 3, 4, and 7 are the most relevant. \nThe answer: A type of green algae.", "{3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from other concepts, so it is important to note that chloroplasts are not a color. Rule 8 is important because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if most chloroplasts come from a certain place, then it can be inferred that some chloroplasts come from other places. Rule 16 is important because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so it is important to note that Paulinella chromatophora is an exception to the norm. Rule 17 is important because it states that negations are important for the answer, so it is important to note that the question is asking for where most chloroplasts come from, not where they do not come from. \nThe answer: Most chloroplasts originate from the first set of endosymbiotic events.", "{3, 5, 8, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: It acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from others, so any information about the size of Chromatophore DNA is irrelevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the Synechococcus genome is three million base pairs long and the chromatophore DNA is much less than that, then the answer must be \"less than three million.\" \nThe answer: less than three million", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the Synechococcus genome has three million base pairs and the chromatophore DNA has around 850 protein-encoding genes, then the chromatophore genome is much smaller than the Synechococcus genome. Therefore, the answer is 850. \nThe answer: around 850", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage compares the size of the Synechococcus genome to that of the chromatophore DNA and the chloroplast genome. The answer can be found in the sentence \"Chromatophore DNA is about a million base pairs long, containing around 850 protein encoding genes\u2014far less than the three million base pair Synechococcus genome\". The use of \"far less\" indicates that the Synechococcus genome is larger than the chromatophore DNA. However, the question asks for the exact number of base pairs in the Synechococcus DNA, which is not provided in the passage. Therefore, the answer is \"not given\".", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be \"plastome\" or \"DNA\" alone. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore the capitalization of \"DNA\" in the question. \nThe answer: cpDNA", "{rule list: 7}\nExplanation: The rule states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. \"ctDNA\" and \"cpDNA\" are both abbreviations for chloroplast DNA, making them synonyms. \nThe answer: ctDNA or cpDNA", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"Its existence was first proved in 1962.\" The relevant rules are 3 (color is a different concept from age and shape), 12 (irrelevant passages can be ignored), 16 (first comes before last), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: 1962", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 2, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The first plastome was sequenced in 1986.\nThe answer: 1986", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who first sequenced the chloroplast DNA, which is a specific piece of information mentioned in the article. Rules 13 and 17 are relevant because names are important for the answer and negations are important for the question. \nThe answer: Two Japanese research teams", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants and accumulate few mutations.\nThe answer: inverted repeat regions", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that some chloroplast DNAs have lost or flipped the inverted repeats, making them direct repeats. This means that some inverted repeats have become direct repeats.\nThe answer: direct repeats", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more. This means that if a chloroplast DNA loses some of its inverted repeat segments, it becomes less stable and more prone to rearrangement. Therefore, the inverted repeats help to maintain the stability of the chloroplast genome. \nThe answer: stabilize the chloroplast genome", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: via electron microscopy", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rules of \"synonyms in the context paragraph\" and \"antonyms\" are relevant because the question asks for the number of replication models, and the article mentions \"two main models.\" \nThe answer: Two", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the D-loop adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate. Therefore, a Cairns replication intermediate is a theta intermediary form. \nThe answer: a theta intermediary form", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: A D-loop is a double displacement loop that moves through the circular DNA during chloroplast DNA replication, adopting a theta intermediary form and completing replication with a rolling circle mechanism. It is a structure formed during DNA replication where the template strand loops out and the newly synthesized strand takes its place, creating a displacement.", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 9 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the D-loop completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism, so we can infer that it does not finish replicating with a D-loop. Rule 16 is relevant because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage describes the D-loop moving through the circular DNA and adopting a theta intermediary form before completing replication with a rolling circle mechanism, so we can infer that the D-loop finishes replicating with a rolling circle mechanism. \nThe answer: The D-loop finishes replicating with a rolling circle mechanism.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible gradients. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if there are A \u2192 G deamination gradients, there must also be G \u2192 A deamination gradients. Therefore, the answer is A \u2192 G and G \u2192 A deamination gradients. \nThe answer: A \u2192 G and G \u2192 A deamination gradients.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: DNA becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the structure of cpDNA according to the secondary theory. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the secondary theory suggests a different structure than the leading theory is relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the leading theory suggests circular cpDNA, then the secondary theory suggests non-circular cpDNA. \nThe answer: The secondary theory suggests that most cpDNA is non-circular, including branched, linear, or other complex structures.", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is relevant because the question asks about how cpDNA replicates. The answer is: through homologous recombination.", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 9 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the first theory is the leading theory, so the second theory is the antonym of the leading theory. Rule 16 is relevant because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage mentions the first theory first and the second theory last. \nThe answer: only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that cpDNA replication is similar to bacteriophage T4 replication is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we rephrase the question as \"What is cpDNA's replication not similar to?\", the answer would be \"it is not similar to homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4.\" \nThe answer: Homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"some plants have linear cpDNA, such as maize.\" This indicates that maize has linear cpDNA.\nThe answer: linear", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the arrangement of cpDNA is not related to any of these concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if most plants' cpDNA is circular, then it is not linear. \nThe answer: circular", "{3, 8, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that some plants have linear cpDNA and others have circular cpDNA is relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article states that the predominant theory is that most cpDNA is circular, then it can be inferred that some plants have linear cpDNA but it is not the most common form. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so the fact that the article mentions a D-loop mechanism of replication being insufficient to explain the replication of branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments implies that most cpDNA replicates via a D-loop mechanism. \nThe answer: most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that lost chloroplasts are not related to size, shape, or age. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we rephrase the question as \"What provides evidence for the existence of lost chloroplasts?\", we can use the answer \"genes donated to the former host's nucleus\" as evidence for the lost chloroplasts. \nThe answer: genes donated to the former host's nucleus", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" does not apply here because there is no comparison between two entities. However, rule 3 applies because it clarifies that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. The answer is: the donated genes provide evidence of the lost chloroplast's existence.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that diatoms now have a red algal derived chloroplast, but that they also have many green algal genes in their nucleus, indicating that their ancestor likely had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point. Therefore, diatoms had a green algal derived chloroplast in the past, but now have a red algal derived chloroplast.\nThe answer: red algal derived chloroplast", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that diatoms had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point, but it was subsequently replaced by a red chloroplast. This means that they lost the green chloroplast. \nThe answer: green algal derived chloroplast", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: nonfunctional pseudogenes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the amount of protein products of transferred genes that don't go back to chloroplasts, which implies a comparison between the amount that does go back and the amount that doesn't. Therefore, rule 3 applies to differentiate between the concepts of protein products and chloroplasts, and rule 8 applies to infer that if some protein products are exaptations, then the opposite is also true, and some are still targeted back to the chloroplast. \nThe answer: around half", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: participating in cell division, protein routing, and disease resistance", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in many secondary plastids, the chloroplast is bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, which is topologically outside of the cell. To reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, one has to cross the cell membrane, just like if they were headed for the extracellular space. Therefore, the answer is the cell membrane.\nThe answer: cell membrane", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The article explains that the chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol.\nThe answer: ribosome in the cytosol", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the sentence, \"After a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol,\" the first part of the sentence (\"After a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized\") indicates the action that is being taken, and the last part of the sentence (\"on a ribosome in the cytosol\") specifies where the action is taking place. Therefore, the answer is \"on a ribosome in the cytosol.\" \nThe answer: on a ribosome in the cytosol.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to many chloroplast proteins in their transit sequences, which helps them bind the polypeptide and prevents premature folding. This ensures that chloroplast proteins assume their active form and carry out their functions in the correct place, the chloroplast. \nThe answer: helps chloroplast proteins bind the polypeptide and prevents premature folding.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that shape is a different concept from size and age is not relevant to this question. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B is relevant because the question asks for the benefit of polypeptide binding, which implies that there is a positive effect. The answer is: it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place\u2014the cytosol.", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage states that chloroplasts in land plants are generally lens-shaped.\nThe answer: lens-shaped", "{3}\nExplanation: The article states that chloroplasts in land plants are \"5-8 \u03bcm in diameter.\" \nThe answer: 5-8 \u03bcm", "{3}\nExplanation: The article states that chloroplasts in land plants are \"1-3 \u03bcm thick.\"\nThe answer: 1-3 \u03bcm", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are different concepts, so the size of Oedogonium's chloroplasts is irrelevant. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about a comparison between the shape of Oedogonium's chloroplasts and the shapes of chloroplasts in other algae. \nThe answer: net-shaped", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can focus on the specific shape of Chlamydomonas's chloroplasts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that Chlamydomonas's chloroplasts are cup-shaped, we can infer that they are not net-shaped, ribbon-like, or twisted bands. \nThe answer: cup-shaped", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A is relevant because it helps to understand the misconception that the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the host's cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium. The answer is that the fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: That it is the product of the host's cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any comparison between them is not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that both chloroplast membranes are homologous to the cyanobacterium's original double membranes, then we can infer that they are not different from the original membranes. \nThe answer: Both chloroplast membranes are not different from the cyanobacterium's original double membranes.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and the rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the chloroplast double membrane is often compared to the mitochondrial double membrane, but this is not a valid comparison because they have different functions and structures. Therefore, the answer is: the chloroplast double membrane is sometimes compared to the mitochondrial double membrane, but this is not a valid comparison.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article compares the chloroplast double membrane to the mitochondrial double membrane, but notes that the inner mitochondrial membrane has a specific function in running proton pumps and carrying out oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP energy. \nThe answer: The inner mitochondrial membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP energy.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that \"function\" is a different concept from \"size, shape, age, and color\". The rule 5 states that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\". Therefore, the fact that oxidative phosphorylation is a function is different from the fact that the chloroplast double membrane is often compared to the mitochondrial double membrane. \nThe answer: It generates ATP energy.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for a structure that is similar to the inner mitochondria membrane, which implies that they are not the same. Therefore, the answer must be the structure that is most antonym to the inner mitochondria membrane, which is the internal thylakoid system.\nThe answer: internal thylakoid system", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a difference between chloroplasts and mitochondria. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so those cannot be used to answer the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can use the fact that the inner chloroplast membrane has no counterpart in the mitochondrion to answer the question.\nThe answer: The inner chloroplast membrane has no counterpart in the mitochondrion.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that stromules are \"much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots, respectively.\" This indicates that stromules are more common in other types of plastids than in chloroplasts.\nThe answer: Stromules", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article says stromules are rare in chloroplasts but more common in other plastids, then stromules are not common in chloroplasts. Therefore, a stromule is a stroma-containing tubule that protrudes from chloroplast membranes into the cytoplasm, and is more commonly found in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts. \nThe answer: a stroma-containing tubule that protrudes from chloroplast membranes into the cytoplasm, and is more commonly found in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What is the purpose of stromules?\" The answer is: to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: Stromules were first observed in 1962, but some plant biologists dismissed them as artifactual. However, there is growing evidence that they are functional features of plant cell plastids.\nThe answer: Stromules were first observed in 1962.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The location of the chloroplast peripheral reticulum is discussed in the passage, and there are no synonyms or antonyms to consider. Rule 3 applies because the location is a different concept than the structure itself. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the usual location, implying that it may be found elsewhere in some cases.\nThe answer: in the chloroplasts of C4 plants, and sometimes in some C3 angiosperms and gymnosperms.", "Rules: 3, 8\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article mentions that the chloroplast peripheral reticulum is often found in the chloroplasts of C4 plants, though it has also been found in some C3 angiosperms, and even some gymnosperms. Therefore, it is less commonly found in C3 angiosperms and gymnosperms. \nThe answer: C3 angiosperms and gymnosperms.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other concepts, and the question is asking for a description of a shape. Rule 8 applies because the question is asking for a definition of a specific phrase used in the article.\nThe answer: The chloroplast peripheral reticulum is a maze of membranous tubes.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the chloroplast peripheral reticulum increases the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm. Therefore, it can be inferred that the chloroplast peripheral reticulum facilitates transport between the chloroplast and the cell cytoplasm. \nThe answer: Facilitate transport between the chloroplast and the cell cytoplasm.", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" is relevant because it helps us understand that if transport vesicles move between the thylakoids and intermembrane space, then they also move between the intermembrane space and thylakoids. \nThe answer: transport vesicles move between the thylakoids and intermembrane space.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts use their ribosomes to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins. \nThe answer: To synthesize a small fraction of their proteins.", "{Rule 2, Rule 3}\nExplanation: Chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes (around 17 nm vs 25 nm). This means that they are smaller than cytoplasmic ribosomes. \nThe answer: about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes (around 17 nm vs 25 nm)", "{Rule 2, Rule 8}\nExplanation: The article states that chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes, which means that cytoplasmic ribosomes are larger than chloroplast ribosomes. Therefore, using Rule 8, we can say that chloroplast ribosomes are less large than cytoplasmic ribosomes. \nThe answer: 25 nm", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size and shape are different concepts, so the size of chloroplast ribosomes compared to cytoplasmic ribosomes is not relevant to the answer. However, the absence of shine-dalgarno sequence recognition motifs in small subunit ribosomal RNAs is important and is a feature unique to some Chlorophyta and euglenid chloroplasts. \nThe answer: motifs for shine-dalgarno sequence recognition", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The shine-dalgarno sequence is considered essential for translation initiation in most chloroplasts and prokaryotes. This means that it is necessary for the ribosome to recognize where to start translating the mRNA. Therefore, the absence of this sequence can affect the translation process. \nThe answer: It is considered essential for translation initiation.", "{3}\nExplanation: Plastoglobuli is plural, so a single one is called plastoglobulus.\nThe answer: plastoglobulus", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Plastoglobuli are described as \"spherical bubbles\" in the article, indicating that their shape is spherical.\nThe answer: spherical", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Plastoglobuli are \"spherical bubbles of lipids and proteins\", indicating that they are made of both lipids and proteins. This answer follows rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5, which states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. \nThe answer: lipids and proteins", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from shape, age, and color.\nThe answer: 45-60 nanometers across.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts.\nThe answer: A lipid monolayer.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Plastoglobuli are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid.\nThe answer: thylakoid", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Plastoglobuli are permanently attached to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid, allowing them to exchange their contents with the thylakoid network.\nThe answer: Plastoglobuli exchange contents with the thylakoid network.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Plastoglobuli in green chloroplasts occur singularly and are attached directly to their parent thylakoid. \nThe answer: singularly", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Plastoglobuli occur in linked groups in old or stressed chloroplasts. \nThe answer: in old or stressed chloroplasts", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Pyrenoids are found in the chloroplasts of some hornworts and algae, but not in higher plants.\nThe answer: in the chloroplasts of some hornworts and algae", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The rule states that shape is a different concept from size, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles. Therefore, the shape of pyrenoids is the relevant information for this question.\nThe answer: roughly spherical", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: Pyrenoids are roughly spherical and highly refractive bodies which consist of a matrix opaque to electrons, surrounded by two hemispherical starch plates.\nThe answer: roughly spherical and highly refractive bodies", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Pyrenoids store starch.\nThe answer: Starch", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Pyrenoids can divide to form new pyrenoids or be produced \"de novo\".", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, and the question is asking about the shape of grana. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if the grana are described as \"flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes,\" then the answer is that grana look like pancakes in the helical thylakoid model.\nThe answer: helical thylakoid model", "Rules: 3\nExplanation: The rule states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The question asks for the shape of granal thylakoids, which is a concept related to shape. Therefore, we can directly answer the question without considering any other concepts.\nThe answer: flattened circular (pancake-like)", "{rule list}\n1. Size is a different concept from quantity.\n2. Superlatives indicate extremes.\nExplanation: The question asks for the quantity of a specific type of thylakoid in a granum. Rule 1 states that size and quantity are different concepts, so we can't assume that the size of the granum determines the quantity of granal thylakoids. Rule 2 tells us that superlatives indicate extremes, so we can assume that the most common quantity of granal thylakoids is between 10-20. \nThe answer: anywhere from two to a hundred, but grana with 10-20 thylakoids are most common.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids, but grana with 10-20 thylakoids are most common. Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept from number, so we can't assume that the size of the granum is related to the number of thylakoids it contains. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if grana with 10-20 thylakoids are most common, then we can assume that this is the average or typical number of thylakoids in each granum. \nThe answer: 10-20", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: \"frets\" are another name for helicoid stromal thylakoids, which are wrapped around the grana in the helical thylakoid model. This information is directly stated in the second sentence of the passage. \nThe answer: helicoid stromal thylakoids", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, if chlorophyll absorbs light energy and carotenoids also absorb light energy but to a lesser extent, then chlorophyll is the most absorbent pigment and carotenoids are less absorbent. \nThe answer: light energy", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Carotenoids are a type of pigment that are found in the light-harvesting complexes of photosystem II and photosystem I, and they absorb light energy along with chlorophyll. \nThe answer: light energy", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Chlorophyll absorbs light energy and uses it to energize electrons in the light-harvesting complexes of photosystem II and photosystem I, as stated in the article. \nThe answer: Chlorophyll uses light energy to energize electrons.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The thylakoid membrane uses the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, decreasing the pH and turning it acidic.\nThe answer: to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that ATP synthase is a \"large protein complex\" is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if ATP synthase is similar to something, then that something is similar to ATP synthase. Therefore, the answer is: a dam turbine.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage explicitly states that there are two types of thylakoids - granal thylakoids and stromal thylakoids.\nThe answer: Two", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because the answer is about a distinguishing feature of granal thylakoids, which is their shape. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because the question asks for what distinguishes granal thylakoids, implying that there is something that sets them apart from other types of thylakoids. The answer is that granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks, while stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana, while granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks arranged in grana. \nThe answer: they are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: pancake-shaped circular disks", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from shape, age, and color.\nThe answer: Granal thylakoids are about 300-600 nanometers in diameter.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids.\nThe answer: about thirty", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Carotenoids help transfer and dissipate excess energy and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green. Therefore, they do not contribute to the primary process of photosynthesis but rather act as accessory pigments. \nThe answer: transfer and dissipate excess energy", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Carotenoids override the green color of chlorophyll, leading to the bright colors seen in fall leaves. This is because chlorophyll breaks down in the fall, revealing the carotenoids that were previously masked by the green pigment. \nThe answer: Carotenoids override the green color of chlorophyll, revealing their bright colors in fall leaves.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Beta carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a.\nThe answer: Beta carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid.", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: Xanthophylls are a group of yellow-orange pigments found in photosystems.

Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks about what phycoerytherin appears in, which is a color. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that color is a different concept from other properties mentioned in the article. The answer is \"many red algae\".", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Phycobilisomes are relatively large protein complexes about 40 nanometers across that organize phycobilin pigments found in cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptophyte chloroplasts. They prevent thylakoid stacking in red algal chloroplasts. \nThe answer: relatively large protein complexes that organize phycobilin pigments", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from color and pigments.\nThe answer: About 40 nanometers across.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: rubisco", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rubisco has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen, so at high oxygen concentrations, rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rubisco's flaw causes ATP energy to be wasted and CO2 to be released without any sugar being produced.\nThe answer: ATP energy is wasted and CO2 is released without any sugar being produced.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that rubisco's flaw causes issues down the line in the Calvin cycle. The use of rule 3 is important to distinguish between the process of photosynthesis and the specific part of photosynthesis that is affected by rubisco's flaw. Rule 8 is important to understand that the opposite of rubisco's ability to distinguish between carbon dioxide and oxygen is its inability to do so. Rule 17 is important to note the use of negation in the question. \nThe answer: The Calvin cycle.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The flaw in rubisco causes ATP energy to be wasted and CO2 to be released.\nThe answer: ATP energy", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts in mesophyll cells are specialized for the light reactions of photosynthesis, so they lack rubisco and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. \nThe answer: the light reactions of photosynthesis", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts in mesophyll cells lack rubisco. \nThe answer: rubisco", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts in mesophyll cells use normal grana and thylakoids to make ATP and NADPH. \nThe answer: normal grana and thylakoids", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if mesophyll cells store CO2 in a four-carbon compound, then the answer to the question is not a four-carbon compound. Therefore, the answer is CO2. \nThe answer: CO2.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts in bundle sheath cells are specialized for carrying out the Calvin cycle and making sugar. They do not carry out the light reactions and lack photosystem II, but have photosystem I for cyclic electron flow. They also lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks and instead have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma. They are different from chloroplasts in mesophyll cells, which are specialized for the light reactions and lack rubisco. \nThe answer: carrying out the Calvin cycle and making sugar", "3, 8\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it clarifies that the presence of chloroplasts is not related to any of these concepts. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for what parts of plants have chloroplasts, implying that not all parts do. Therefore, the answer is: green parts of a plant.", "{3}\nExplanation: The chlorophyll in chloroplasts makes the photosynthetic parts of a plant green.\nThe answer: chlorophyll in chloroplasts", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we rephrase the question as \"What plant cells do not have chloroplasts in them?\", the answer would be \"not all cells in a multicellular plant\". Therefore, the answer to the original question is \"parenchyma cells and collenchyma tissue cells\". \nThe answer: Parenchyma cells and collenchyma tissue cells.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts can be found in some plant cells, specifically parenchyma cells and collenchyma tissue. \nThe answer: in some plant cells", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Chlorenchyma cell is a plant cell that contains chloroplasts. This fits the definition of a plant cell that contains chloroplasts, which are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green. \nThe answer: A plant cell that contains chloroplasts.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because the question asks where chloroplasts are found in cacti, implying that they are not found in other plants. Therefore, the answer is: in the stems.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts are mainly concentrated in the leaves of most plants, specifically in the mesophyll layers and guard cells of stomata. \nThe answer: leaves", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because the question asks about the number of chloroplasts in stomatal guard cells, which is a size-related concept. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because the passage states that palisade mesophyll cells contain 30-70 chloroplasts per cell, while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8-15 per cell. Therefore, the answer is: around 8-15 chloroplasts per cell.", "{2, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 2 applies because the article mentions that one square millimeter of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts, making it the most chloroplast-rich part of the leaf. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific quantity, which is the number of chloroplasts in a given area of the leaf. \nThe answer: half a million chloroplasts", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we ask for the layers of a leaf that have chloroplasts, we can infer that there are layers that do not have chloroplasts. Therefore, the answer is: mesophyll layers and guard cells of stomata.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The passage explains that in low-light conditions, chloroplasts will spread out in a sheet, maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Therefore, the answer is: in low-light conditions.", "{2, 3}\nExplanation: When there is intense light, chloroplasts will align in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turn sideways so that light strikes them edge-on to reduce exposure and protect them from photooxidative damage. This is a specific condition that triggers the orientation of chloroplasts, which falls under the concept of shape. \nThe answer: Under intense light.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Therefore, turning sideways is a change in shape and not size, age, or color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, turning sideways protects chloroplasts from photooxidative damage, which is the opposite of protecting them from photooxidative damage. Therefore, the answer is photooxidative damage. \nThe answer: photooxidative damage.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from others, and this is relevant because the article mentions that land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. This is relevant because the question asks why land plants have more and smaller chloroplasts, implying that having fewer and larger chloroplasts is less advantageous. Therefore, the answer is that land plants have more and smaller chloroplasts because this allows them to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out, which is more advantageous than having fewer and larger chloroplasts.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: mitochondria", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Plants have two main immune responses\nThe answer: 2", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The hypersensitive response is when infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death. This is a comparison between infected and healthy cells, which falls under rule 1. The response is also described as a specific action, which falls under rule 3.\nThe answer: infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion between the terms \"immune response\" and \"plant immune system.\" The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any irrelevant information about the chloroplasts. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" allows for the use of \"response\" instead of \"immunity.\" The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" helps to identify that the systemic acquired resistance response is not the hypersensitive response. \nThe answer: The systemic acquired resistance response is a response where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence, triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The passage describes how chloroplasts stimulate the plant's immune responses by damaging their photosynthetic system and producing reactive oxygen species. High levels of reactive oxygen species cause the hypersensitive response, while lower levels initiate systemic acquired resistance. This shows that the level of reactive oxygen species determines which immune response is triggered. \nThe answer: By producing reactive oxygen species that determine the level of immune response.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: reactive oxygen species", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" are relevant here. The question asks for the molecules that act as defense signals, which is referring to the same concept as \"defense-signals\" mentioned in the passage. The answer is salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species. \nThe answer: salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species.", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that after detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing defense-signals like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, chloroplasts produce defense signals when they detect stress in a cell. \nThe answer: When they detect stress in a cell.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about what happens to reactive oxygen species signals, which are unstable molecules that do not leave the chloroplast. Therefore, according to rule 8, the answer is that they probably pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. \nThe answer: They pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Retrograde signaling is a type of signaling where signals from the chloroplast regulate gene expression in the nucleus. This is a type of signaling that goes against the typical flow of information from the nucleus to the organelles, hence the term \"retrograde.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes the main function of chloroplasts as their role in photosynthesis, which is the process of transforming light into chemical energy to produce food in the form of sugars. Therefore, the answer is photosynthesis.\nThe answer: Photosynthesis", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison between light and chemical energy. Rule 3 applies because size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from the process of changing light into chemical energy.\nThe answer: photosynthesis", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The chloroplast's role in photosynthesis is to transform light into chemical energy, which is subsequently used to produce food in the form of sugars.\nThe answer: food in the form of sugars", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for the molecular inputs for photosynthesis, which are water and carbon dioxide. The antonym of \"inputs\" is \"outputs,\" which are sugar and oxygen. Therefore, the answer is: water and carbon dioxide.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the molecular outputs of photosynthesis, which are sugar and oxygen. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if water and carbon dioxide are used in photosynthesis, then sugar and oxygen are the outputs. \nThe answer: sugar and oxygen", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the question asks for a similarity between chloroplasts and mitochondria. Rule 3 applies because the answer should focus on the function, not the structure or color of the organelles.\nThe answer: Use the potential energy stored in an H+ gradient to generate ATP energy.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the location of the pumping of hydrogen ions is not affected by their size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 applies because the question asks where the chloroplasts pump hydrogen, implying that they are actively moving the hydrogen ions. \nThe answer: into the thylakoid space.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The concentration of hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space is described as \"up to a thousand times as many\" as in the stroma, indicating a significant difference in concentration. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the concentration of hydrogen ions cannot be compared to these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B, so if the concentration of hydrogen ions is described as \"more\" in the thylakoid space than in the stroma, then the concentration in the stroma is \"less.\" \nThe answer: up to a thousand times as many", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage explains that ATP synthase uses the energy from flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. This is an example of a biochemical process, which falls under the category of \"chemistry\" and is covered by rule 3. Additionally, the passage describes the process in an active sentence, where the subject (ATP synthase) acts upon the verb (phosphorylate), which is covered by rule 23. \nThe answer: adenosine diphosphate", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The question asks for the meaning of the acronym \"ATP\", which is defined in the passage as \"adenosine triphosphate\". Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so it is not relevant that ATP is a molecule. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so any misspelling or capitalization of \"ATP\" does not affect the answer.\nThe answer: adenosine triphosphate", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that \"normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP+.\" This means that NADP+ usually takes reenergized electrons.\nThe answer: NADP+", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that in cyclic photophosphorylation, electrons are recycled. This means that the process involves the reuse of electrons that have already been used in a previous step. Therefore, rule 3 (different concepts) applies to distinguish between the concept of recycling electrons and other processes that involve the movement of electrons. Rule 8 (antonyms) also applies, as the question asks for the opposite of a statement in the passage (\"In what process are electrons recycled?\"). The opposite of \"recycled\" is \"not recycled\" or \"used for the first time\", but the question asks for the process in which electrons are recycled, so the answer is \"cyclic photophosphorylation\". \nThe answer: cyclic photophosphorylation", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We can infer from the passage that cyclic photophosphorylation is more common in C4 plants than in other types of plants. Therefore, we can apply rule 3 to understand that \"C4 plants\" and \"other types of plants\" are different concepts. Additionally, we can apply rule 8 to understand that if cyclic photophosphorylation is more common in C4 plants, then it is less common in other types of plants. \nThe answer: C4 plants", "{3, 4, 5, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that different concepts (3) such as size, shape, age, and color are not interchangeable, and that profession and nationality (4) are also different concepts. Additionally, animals and vehicles (5) are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, since C4 plants need more ATP than NADPH, the answer is ATP. \nThe answer: ATP", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Rubisco is mentioned as an enzyme used in a cycle, so we need to identify which cycle it is referring to. Rule 3 tells us that we can consider \"start\" as a synonym for \"begins with.\" Rule 7 tells us that we need to pay attention to synonyms in the question. \nThe answer: The Calvin cycle.", "{3, 4, 5, 6}\nExplanation: The Calvin cycle uses Rubisco to fix CO2 into five-carbon RuBP molecules, which results in unstable six-carbon molecules that break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-PGA. The ATP and NADPH from the light reactions are used to convert the 3-PGA into G3P sugar molecules. Most of the G3P molecules are recycled back into RuBP using energy from more ATP, but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle as the end product of the dark reactions. \nThe answer: G3P sugar molecules", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we know that the answer cannot be related to any of those concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that unstable 6-carbon molecules become stable 3-carbon molecules. \nThe answer: 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"one out of every six produced leaves the cycle.\" This means that one G3P molecule leaves the cycle for every six produced.\nThe answer: one", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage explains that glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch, which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast. Therefore, an alternate way to make starch is by linking glucose monomers together in the chloroplast.\nThe answer: Linking glucose monomers together in the chloroplast", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that under certain conditions, such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, starch grains in chloroplasts may grow very large, potentially distorting the grana and thylakoids. Therefore, when atmospheric CO2 concentrations are high, starch grains may become overly large.\nThe answer: Under high atmospheric CO2 concentrations.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size and amount are different concepts, so the answer should not mention size. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about a negative consequence of large starch grains. \nThe answer: They may distort the grana and thylakoids, but do not necessarily significantly interfere with the efficiency of photosynthesis.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant information in the passage is that \"Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts.\" This means that when the roots of a plant are waterlogged, it can cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts. The rules used are 3 (to differentiate between concepts of root problems and starch buildup), 7 (to identify synonyms in the question and passage), and 17 (to recognize the importance of negations in the question). \nThe answer: Waterlogging", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that starch grains in chloroplasts may be a side effect of another factor that depresses photosynthesis rates. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which helps to eliminate irrelevant information. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which helps to identify that \"side effect\" is a synonym for \"may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which helps to identify that the answer is not the factor that directly causes starch buildup, but rather a side effect of it. \nThe answer: Another factor that depresses photosynthesis rates.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that Rubisco can accidentally add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP. Rule 3 applies because the concepts of oxygen and carbon dioxide are different. \nThe answer: add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and profession. Since the question does not ask about any of these concepts, this rule is not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks when photorespiration happens, so we can use the antonym of \"when\" which is \"not when\" to answer the question. Therefore, the answer is: photorespiration happens when the oxygen concentration is too high.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: When Rubisco adds O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP, it triggers photorespiration which reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis. This process consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO2, and produces no sugar, wasting up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. Therefore, using O2 instead of CO2 is less efficient. \nThe answer: Using O2 instead of CO2 triggers photorespiration, which reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that photorespiration can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. This means that when Rubisco adds O2 instead of CO2, half of the carbon that should have been fixed is wasted.\nThe answer: up to half", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: C4 plants' chloroplasts exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.\nThe answer: they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that chloroplasts make almost all of a plant cell's amino acids in their stroma, except for sulfur-containing ones like cysteine and methionine. Since the question asks specifically about where chloroplasts make amino acids, we can use rule 3 to determine that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, we can use it to infer that since cysteine is made in the chloroplast but also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria, it is likely that the chloroplast is the primary site for amino acid synthesis. \nThe answer: Chloroplasts make almost all of a plant cell's amino acids in their stroma.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for the amino acids that contain sulfur, which is the antonym of \"sulfur-containing.\" Therefore, the answer is cysteine and methionine. \nThe answer: cysteine and methionine.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the passage explains that cysteine is made in the chloroplast but has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed, implying that there is a problem with its transportation. Therefore, the answer is: cysteine has trouble crossing membranes.", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify what is unclear about how chloroplasts make methionine precursors, which is a specific detail. Rule 3 tells us that concepts like size, shape, age, and color are different and not interchangeable. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so we need to focus on the relevant information about methionine synthesis. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"unclear.\" \nThe answer: whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The article states that \"plastids\" and \"chloroplasts\" are sometimes used interchangeably, indicating that they are different concepts but can be confused or used synonymously.\nThe answer: Chloroplasts", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote, or fertilized egg", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant's apical meristems.\nThe answer: in an adult plant's apical meristems", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in root tip meristems, instead, the formation of starch-storing amyloplasts is more common.\nThe answer: Formation of starch-storing amyloplasts", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts.\nThe answer: proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: An etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a prolamellar body. This definition is given in the passage and is a straightforward answer to the question.\nThe answer: A plastid that lacks chlorophyll and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a prolamellar body.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that shape is a different concept from color is irrelevant, but the rule that antonyms are important applies because the question asks for what the internal membranes of etioplasts form. The answer is a lattice of tubes called a prolamellar body. \nThe answer: a prolamellar body", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from shape and Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, etioplasts lack chlorophyll, so they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked instead. Therefore, the answer is \"yellow chlorophyll precursor\". \nThe answer: yellow chlorophyll precursor", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that gymnosperms do not require light to form chloroplasts.\nThe answer: gymnosperms", "{1, 2, 3}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts can be converted to chromoplasts or amyloplasts, and can also revert back to proplastids. This demonstrates the concept of plastid differentiation not being permanent and the possibility of interconversions. \nThe answer: Chromoplasts or amyloplasts, and can also revert back to proplastids.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Chromoplasts are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit. They are different from chloroplasts, which are responsible for photosynthesis, and from amyloplasts, which store starch. Therefore, rule 3 applies to differentiate between the concepts of size, shape, age, and color, and rule 5 applies to differentiate between the concepts of animals and vehicles. \nThe answer: pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that amyloplasts are starch-storing is not relevant to what they can become. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if chloroplasts can become amyloplasts, then amyloplasts can become chloroplasts. Therefore, the answer is chloroplasts. \nThe answer: chloroplasts", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Proplastids can become chromoplasts, chloroplasts, or other types of plastids, indicating that their differentiation is not permanent and can change. This is covered by rule 3. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about what proplastids can become, implying that they have the potential to differentiate into other types of plastids. \nThe answer: Chromoplasts, chloroplasts, or other types of plastids.", "{3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other characteristics, so the fact that a plastid can change shape is not relevant to the answer. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored, so the information about chloroplasts and chromoplasts is not necessary. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to focus on the sentence that mentions reversion to a meristematic state. \nThe answer: chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we cannot assume that FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 combine into a specific size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 combine into filaments, we can infer that they combine into a structure that is not filamentous. \nThe answer: a Z-ring", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 are proteins involved in the division process of chloroplasts.\nThe answer: proteins involved in the division process of chloroplasts.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, with the help of ARC6, form a structure called a Z-ring within the chloroplast's stroma.\nThe answer: a Z-ring structure within the chloroplast's stroma.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the location of the Z-ring is not related to any of these concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the location of the Z-ring, and the passage describes that the Z-ring is formed within the chloroplast's stroma. Therefore, the answer is: within the chloroplast's stroma.", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts), 9 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The answer is: The Min system manages the placement of the Z-ring.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: PD rings are two rings that form during plastid division, with the inner ring located in the inner side of the chloroplast's inner membrane and the outer ring wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane. In some species, there may be a third ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space. \nThe answer: Two rings that form during plastid division.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the number of rings is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the inner plastid-dividing ring is formed before the outer plastid-dividing ring. Therefore, there are two plastid-dividing rings.\nThe answer: two", "{rule list}\nExplanation: We need to find the size of the filaments that make up the outer plastid-dividing ring. \nThe answer: about 5 nanometers across", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage describes the structure of the outer plastid-dividing ring, which consists of filaments arranged in rows. The passage provides the specific measurements that the filaments are about 5 nanometers across and arranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart.\nThe answer: 6.4 nanometers apart", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in a few species like Cyanidioschyzon merol\u00e6, chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space. \nThe answer: They have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage states that chloroplasts require exposure to bright white light to complete division, implying that without it, they would not be able to replicate. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about replication, which is a different concept from growth and progression through constriction stages. \nThe answer: exposure to bright white light", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the type of light is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if poor quality green light is not sufficient for chloroplast division, then bright white light is necessary. \nThe answer: bright white light", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: Chloroplasts in spinach grown under green light are observed to be dumbbell-shaped.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The question asks about the kind of light that is inadequate for chloroplasts to divide, which relates to the concept of \"quality\" of light rather than its color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light, but are slow to complete division. Therefore, the answer is poor quality green light. \n\nThe answer: poor quality green light", "{1, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The article discusses how chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent in most flowering plants, making them a valuable tool for creating genetically modified plants that are biologically contained and pose lower environmental risks. This is because transgenes in chloroplasts cannot be disseminated by pollen. Therefore, chloroplast transformation is a suitable biological containment strategy for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. \nThe answer: Chloroplasts are a valuable tool for creating genetically modified plants that are biologically contained and pose lower environmental risks.", "3, 4, 5, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so it is relevant to the answer because using plastid transformation for gene modification reduces the environmental risks. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so it is relevant to the answer because using plastid transformation for gene modification reduces the risks. \nThe answer: environmental risks", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 3 in 1,000,000", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses the use of plastid transformation in genetically modified crops, which allows for biological containment and lower environmental risks. The question asks for the name of plants with plastid gene transformations, which are referred to as \"transplastomic plants\" in the article.\nThe answer: transplastomic plants", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it states that if A has more of X than B, then B has less of X than A. In this case, a prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself, so the answer is that a prime number can have no other divisors besides 1. Rule 3 is not relevant because size, shape, age, and color are not concepts being compared in this question. \nThe answer: itself", "3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The passage defines composite numbers as natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime, and gives the example of 6 as a composite number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (2 and 3). Therefore, the answer is composite numbers. \nThe answer: composite numbers", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that primes have a central role in number theory and that any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a unique product of primes. This is known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. \nThe answer: fundamental theorem of arithmetic", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. This is known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Therefore, the answer is a product of primes. \nThe answer: primes", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Therefore, the number 1 is not excluded because of its size, shape, age, or color, but because it can be included arbitrarily many times in any factorization, which would violate the uniqueness of the fundamental theorem. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, excluding 1 as a prime is the antonym of preserving the uniqueness of the fundamental theorem. \nThe answer: To preserve the uniqueness of the fundamental theorem, one must exclude 1 as a prime.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\", which means that the property of being prime or not is a distinct concept from these. Therefore, we can use the name \"primality\" to refer to this property, as stated in the article. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can directly extract the answer from the article. \nThe answer: primality", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that the property of being prime is called primality, which is a definition (Rule 3). The article also mentions a method called trial division for verifying primality (Rule 1), but the question asks for the name of the process, which is primality.\nThe answer: primality", "3, 8\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 is relevant because it mentions algorithms for testing primality. The answer is \"Miller-Rabin primality test\" or \"AKS primality test\".", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it establishes that the name of the algorithm is not related to its size, shape, age, or color. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because it establishes that if the Miller-Rabin primality test is fast but has a small probability of error, then the AKS primality test is slow but always produces the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is the AKS primality test. \n\nThe answer: AKS primality test", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits.\" This means that the number consists of 22,338,618 digits.\nThe answer: 22,338,618", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the number of prime numbers, which implies a comparison to other numbers. Rule 3 applies because the concept of \"existence\" is different from size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: There are infinitely many primes.", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that Euclid demonstrated the existence of infinitely many primes around 300 BC, so the answer is Euclid.\nThe answer: Euclid", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that there is no known simple formula to separate prime numbers from composite numbers, but the statistical behavior of primes in the large can be modeled. Therefore, it is possible to determine the distribution or statistical behavior of primes. \nThe answer: the statistical behavior of primes in the large", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is given in the passage as the prime number theorem, which states that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n. This answer is obtained by applying rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the prime number theorem was proven at the end of the 19th century.\nThe answer: end of the 19th century", "{1, 2, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a conjecture, which is a supposition or proposed explanation based on limited evidence. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"supposition\" and \"conjecture\" can be used interchangeably. Rule 2 applies because Goldbach's conjecture is a specific example of a conjecture about prime numbers, and it states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Therefore, the answer is Goldbach's conjecture.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The rule of synonyms is relevant here, as \"supposition\" is a synonym for \"conjecture.\" The rule of specific names is also relevant, as the name of the conjecture is mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: twin prime conjecture", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Number theory focuses on both analytic and algebraic aspects of numbers. \nThe answer: algebraic aspects", "{1, 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: These rules establish that prime numbers are a distinct concept from other mathematical domains, and that their difficulty in factoring is important for information technology. \nThe answer: Public-key cryptography.", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: Prime numbers have inspired the concept of prime elements and prime ideals in algebra.\nThe answer: prime elements or prime ideals", "3, 8, 2\nExplanation: According to the passage, \"No even number greater than 2 is prime.\" Therefore, the answer is 2.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that even numbers are greater than 2 is a matter of size, not a divisor. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to focus on the negation of the question. The question asks for the specific divisors of even numbers larger than 2, so the answer is that all even numbers larger than 2 have at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and the even number itself.", "3, 8, 17, 18\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer. The question asks for the name given to any prime number larger than 2, which is an odd prime. Therefore, we can use Rule 3 to eliminate the possibility of the answer being \"larger prime.\" We can use Rule 8 to infer that the answer is \"odd prime\" since it is the antonym of \"even number.\" Finally, we can use Rule 17 and 18 to note that the word \"not\" in \"not prime\" is a negation and does not apply to the answer. \nThe answer: odd prime", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the number ends in a certain digit is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that all primes greater than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, then any number that does not end in one of these digits cannot be prime. Therefore, the answer is 9. \n\nThe answer: 9.", "{3}\nExplanation: Even numbers\nThe answer: Even numbers", "{1, 3, 8, 12, 16, 17}\nExplanation: \n1. size, shape, age, and color are different concepts - This rule is not relevant to the question.\n3. size, shape, age, and color are different concepts - This rule is not relevant to the question.\n8. if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A - This rule is relevant because the article states that early Greeks did not consider 1 to be a number, so they could not consider it to be a prime. Therefore, they regarded 1 as not being a true number.\n12. some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer - This rule is not relevant to the question.\n16. first comes before last and last comes after first - This rule is not relevant to the question.\n17. negations are important for the answer - This rule is relevant because the question asks for a number that early Greeks did not regard as a true number, which is a negation. \nThe answer: 1", "{1, 2, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between numbers. Rule 2 applies because it clarifies the meaning of \"first prime number.\" Rule 8 applies because it establishes a relationship between two numbers. Rule 16 applies because it establishes a chronological order. \nThe answer: Christian Goldbach", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" applies because Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime, but Euler did not agree, indicating a disagreement on the level of importance of 1 as a prime number. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime, but Euler did not agree, indicating that Euler believed that 1 was not a prime number. \nThe answer: Leonhard Euler", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: None/0 (because the list started with 1, which is not considered a prime number)", "3, 8, 17, 18, 23\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and since \"type\" is a different concept from these, it is not affected by this rule. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if early Greeks did not consider 1 to be a number, then they would not consider it to be a prime, and therefore modern mathematicians do not consider 1 to be a prime. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and since the question asks for what type of number 1 is not, the negation \"not\" is important. Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer, and since the question includes the negation \"not,\" it is important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: modern mathematicians consider 1 to not be a prime number.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"1 is not a prime number\" is a well-established convention in mathematics, and is necessary for certain theorems and algorithms to work correctly. The answer is Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic. \nThe answer: Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the passage explains that if 1 were considered a prime, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly, as it would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1. Therefore, the answer is that the sieve of Eratosthenes would not be valid if 1 were considered a prime.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.\" Therefore, the answer is that primes have a relationship to Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function that the number 1 does not.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Prime numbers have properties such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function, which 1 lacks because it is not considered a prime number. \nThe answer: relationship to Euler's totient function or sum of divisors function", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: If 1 were considered a prime, the modified version of the sieve of Eratosthenes would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number 1. \nThe answer: the single number 1", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Rhind papyrus contains Egyptian fraction expansions that have different forms for primes and composites, suggesting that the ancient Egyptians had some knowledge of prime numbers. Names are equally important for the answer, so we need to identify the specific papyrus mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: Rhind papyrus", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: We can eliminate rules 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 as they are not relevant to the question. Rule 24 is not applicable as the sentence is in the active voice. Rule 23 is relevant as it explains that the Greeks were the first to explicitly study prime numbers. Rule 16 is also relevant as it tells us that Euclid's work on primes was around 300 BC, which was before the Ancient Egyptians. Therefore, the answer is: Ancient Greeks.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer that the records are \"surviving.\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Euclid's Elements was written around 300 BC. Rule 23 states that the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks, so we can infer that Euclid's Elements is the work referred to in the question. \nThe answer: Euclid's Elements", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. First comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Euclid came before Eratosthenes. Therefore, the answer is Euclid. \nThe answer: Euclid", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"different concepts are different\" (rule 3) is relevant because it distinguishes between the concept of prime numbers and the method for computing them. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" (rule 9) is relevant because the question asks what the Sieve of Eratosthenes does, which is a method for computing primes. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" (rule 17) is relevant because the question asks for the function of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is a positive statement, and the answer should reflect that. \nThe answer: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method to compute prime numbers.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: Fermat's declaration of the theorem is a significant event, so we need to identify the exact year. Negations are important for the answer, as we are looking for the year in which Fermat declared the theorem, not the year in which it was proved. \nThe answer: 1640", "{1, 3, 12, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the mathematician who proved Fermat's little theorem, which is mentioned in the passage. We can ignore the information about Mersenne primes and Fermat numbers, as they are not relevant to the question. The answer is not explicitly stated, but we can infer from the passage that Euler also proved the theorem, as he is mentioned as having discovered that the next Fermat number after 216 + 1 is composite. Therefore, we can apply rules 1, 3, 12, and 13 to extract the answer:\n1. profession and nationality are different concepts\n3. size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\n12. some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer\n13. names are equally important for the answer\nThe answer: Euler", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Fermat numbers are of the form 22n + 1. \nThe answer: 22n + 1", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Mersenne primes are of the form 2p - 1, where p is a prime. \nThe answer: Mersenne primes are of the form 2p - 1.", "{1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: Fermat verified the primality of Fermat numbers up to n=4.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between two entities based on a comparative attribute. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts. \nThe answer: trial division", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The method of trial division can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to the square root of n is known, as trial divisions only need to be checked for those m that are prime. This is an example of rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: checking only for prime numbers", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"greater than 1\" is equivalent to \"less than or equal to the square root of n\" in terms of comparing magnitudes. Rule 8 applies because \"greater than\" implies a comparison of magnitudes, so the antonym of \"greater than\" is \"less than.\" \nThe answer: the square root of n", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: We can use rule 1 to infer that if 37 is prime, then it is not divisible by any integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of 37, which is approximately 6.08. Therefore, we only need to check division by integers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. However, using rule 2, we can further infer that 4 and 6 are composite, so we only need to check division by 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, three divisions are necessary.\nThe answer: 3", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison of the integer m to the square root of n. Rule 3 applies because size is a concept that is relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: the square root of n", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions two main classes of primality tests: probabilistic and deterministic. Probabilistic tests are faster but not completely conclusive, while deterministic tests provide a definite answer. Therefore, there are two modern types of primality tests for general numbers n.\nThe answer: 2", "3, 8\nExplanation: The rules state that different concepts are different, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. This means that we need to focus on finding the name of a type of modern primality test. The answer is \"probabilistic (or 'Monte Carlo')\" as stated in the article.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so the answer cannot be a specific name or number. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"modern primality test.\" \nThe answer: Probabilistic (or \"Monte Carlo\") algorithms are another type of modern primality test.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is relevant because trial division is mentioned first in the paragraph. \nThe answer: deterministic algorithm", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to understand the relationship between the probability of a number being composite and the number of tests performed, which is given by the formula 1/(1-p)^n. This involves understanding the negation of the probability (i.e. the probability that the number is prime) and the exponential decrease in probability as the number of tests increases. \nThe answer: 1/(1-p)^n", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Fermat primality test as a simple example of a probabilistic test. This fits with rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, since the Fermat test is described as \"particularly simple.\" Rule 3 also applies, as the question asks for a \"straightforward\" case, which is synonymous with \"simple.\" \nThe answer: The Fermat primality test", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it helps us understand that if np\u2261n (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number, then the converse is also true. Rule 3 is relevant because it helps us understand that the Fermat primality test relies on a mathematical concept, rather than any physical or visual characteristics of the number. \nThe answer: Fermat's little theorem", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it establishes that the flaw with the Fermat primality test is not related to any of these concepts. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because it allows us to understand that if the Fermat primality test fails for a composite number, then that number must be more complex than a prime number. \nThe answer: Carmichael numbers", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the name of a continuation of the Fermat primality test, which is a specific concept. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate rules related to those concepts. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can eliminate rules related to comparisons. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"fail\" in the question. The answer is: Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, or Solovay-Strassen tests.", "{1, 2, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests.\" This indicates that there are other tests that are extensions of the Fermat primality test. Therefore, we can use rules 1, 2, and 7 to infer that these tests are more powerful than the Fermat primality test. Rule 13 tells us that names are important for the answer, so we can directly answer the question by stating that the name of another compelling continuation of the Fermat primality test is the Miller-Rabin test. \nThe answer: Miller-Rabin", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the form of Sophie Germain primes is not related to any of these. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the form of Sophie Germain primes is not related to any profession or nationality. The relevant rule is rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. \"Form\" is a synonym for \"shape,\" so rule 3 is not applicable. The answer is \"primes of the form 2p + 1 with p prime.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We can infer from the passage that Mersenne primes are of the form 2p - 1, where p is an arbitrary prime. \nThe answer: 2p - 1", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify a test that is useful for numbers of the form 2p - 1, which is mentioned in the last sentence of the passage. Rule 3 tells us that shape is a different concept from other attributes, so we can focus on the specific form of the numbers. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the Lucas-Lehmer test is especially fast for numbers of the form 2p - 1, then it is not fast for other forms of numbers. Therefore, the answer is the Lucas-Lehmer test. \nThe answer: Lucas-Lehmer test", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions several types of primes where p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape, including Sophie Germain primes, primorial primes, Fermat primes, and Mersenne primes. These primes are all examples of primes where p+1 or p-1 has a specific form. \nThe answer: Sophie Germain primes, primorial primes, Fermat primes, or Mersenne primes.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for the name of another type of prime where p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape, which refers to Sophie Germain primes. Therefore, the answer is Sophie Germain primes.", "{3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts (rule 3), and the question is asking for the name of a computing method, which is a profession (rule 4). Therefore, the answer should not involve any of these concepts. Additionally, the question is asking for a synonym of \"computing method,\" which is \"method of computing.\" Therefore, synonyms in the question are important (rule 7). The answer: distributed computing or semi-random binary data.", "{7, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year, which can be found in the passage as \"In 2009, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US$100,000 prize\". Rule 7 is relevant because \"conducted\" is a synonym for \"awarded\". Rule 16 is relevant because the year is mentioned after the event. \nThe answer: 2009", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: US$100,000", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the mention of an organization does not necessarily imply a specific nationality. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the \"not\" in the question. The answer is: Electronic Frontier Foundation.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that some of the largest primes without a distinct form have been found within the interval [256kn + 1, 256k(n + 1) \u2212 1]. This answers the question directly. Rule 3 is relevant to ensure that \"interval\" is not confused with other concepts, and rule 7 is relevant to recognize that \"discovered in\" is synonymous with \"found within.\" \nThe answer: [256kn + 1, 256k(n + 1) \u2212 1]", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, including functions. The rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Therefore, the answer is \"floor function\".", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the person who first proved Bertrand's postulate. This requires understanding that \"proved\" is a keyword indicating that the answer is a person who performed an action. Additionally, the question requires understanding that \"Bertrand's postulate\" is a specific concept that can be attributed to a single person. Therefore, rules 17 and 23 are relevant. \nThe answer: Chebyshev", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Bertrand's postulate states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n \u2212 2, for any natural number n > 3. Therefore, Bertrand's postulate holds for any natural number greater than 3. \nThe answer: any natural number greater than 3", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that \"prime\" and \"natural number\" are different concepts. We use rule 8 to determine that \"exists\" is the antonym of \"not exists\". Therefore, the answer is \"n < p < 2n - 2\".", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Wilson's theorem", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which can be applied to the condition that \"infinitely many primes can exist only if a and q are coprime\" to state that \"if a and q are not coprime, then only finitely many primes can exist.\" Therefore, the answer is \"if a and q are not coprime.\"", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes the necessary condition for the theorem to hold. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that the concept of arithmetic progression is distinct from the other concepts mentioned in the passage. Rule 8 is relevant because it explains that if a is coprime to q, then q is coprime to a, and therefore the theorem still holds. \nThe answer: Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 applies because the density of primes compatible with a modulo 9 is the same as the density of primes not compatible with a modulo 9, and the rule states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is 1/6.", "{3, 6, 8, 16, 19, 21, 26, 28, 38, 41, 43, 48, 49, 51, 56, 58, 68, 71, 73, 78, 81, 83, 88, 96, 98, 101, 106, 108, 113, 116, 118, 121, 126, 128, 131, 133, 138, 146, 148, 151, 156, 158, 163, 166, 168, 173, 176, 178, 181, 186, 188, 193, 196, 198, 206, 209, 211, 216, 218, 223, 226, 228, 233, 236, 238, 241, 246, 248, 251, 258, 263, 266, 268, 271, 278, 281, 283, 288, 291, 293,", "3, 8, 17, 18\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is also not relevant. The relevant rules are Rule 3 and Rule 8. The answer is that there are infinitely many prime numbers in a progression with q=9 and a=1,2,4,5,7, or 8.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the zeta function is closely related to prime numbers and gives an example of how it can be used to prove the infinitude of primes. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that \"zeta function\" is the answer to the question. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms, so \"related\" can be considered a synonym for \"closely related.\" \nThe answer: the zeta function", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the value of the zeta function if there were finite primes, which implies that the zeta function would have less value than if there were infinite primes. Rule 2 applies because the zeta function would have the least possible value if there were no primes, and a finite number of primes is closer to no primes than an infinite number of primes. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the negation of a hypothetical scenario. \nThe answer: a finite value", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A applies because the question asks about the property of the harmonic series that shows there are infinitely many primes, which is the opposite of a finite value. Therefore, the answer is that the harmonic series diverges, or exceeds any given number, which shows that there must be infinitely many primes.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The concept of a series diverging means that the sum of its terms goes to infinity, or does not converge to a finite value. \nThe answer: It means that the sum of its terms goes to infinity.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the mathematical nature of the Basel problem. The relevant rules are 3 (distinguishing between concepts), as the answer is related to a specific mathematical problem, and 17 (negations are important), as the question is asking for the nature of the problem, not for a specific solution. \nThe answer: The Basel problem is a mathematical problem.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Riemann hypothesis dates back to 1859, which is the year it was proposed by Riemann.\nThe answer: 1859", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Riemann hypothesis excludes certain values of s is not related to any of those concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if all zeroes of the \u03b6-function have real part equal to 1/2 except for certain values of s, then those excluded values are the antonym of having a real part equal to 1/2. Therefore, the answer is: s = \u22122, \u22124, ...", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so \"points\" cannot be confused with \"primes.\" Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so \"irregularity\" is the antonym of \"regularly distributed.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so \"random noise\" is the source of irregularity in the distribution of primes.\nThe answer: Random noise.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it establishes that the type of distribution being discussed is not related to any physical characteristics of the primes. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the hypothesis proposes that the distribution of primes in short intervals is as regular as possible, meaning that there are no significant irregularities. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the type of prime distribution proposed by the Riemann hypothesis, not the type of distribution it disproves. \nThe answer: The Riemann hypothesis proposes that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible in short intervals near X.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A is relevant because the question asks about the type of prime distribution characterized by x/log x of numbers less than x. The answer is that this distribution is asymptotic, meaning that it approaches a limit as x gets larger.", "{1, 3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes the relationship between \"every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes\" and Goldbach's conjecture. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the different concepts of even integers and primes. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between the different concepts of a conjecture and a theorem. Rule 8 is relevant because it establishes the relationship between Goldbach's conjecture and weaker statements that have been proven. \nThe answer: Goldbach's conjecture", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Landau proposed his four conjectural problems in 1912.\nThe answer: 1912", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 2 applies because the question asks for a specific number, and the article provides a range of numbers that have been proven. Rule 8 applies because the article states that the conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to a certain point, meaning that any number beyond that point has not been proven. \nThe answer: 2 \u00b7 10^17", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify the theorem that states that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. The rule of size (3) tells us that size is a different concept from other concepts like shape, age, and color. The rule of antonyms (8) tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Using these rules, we can identify Vinogradov's theorem as the one that states that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes.\nThe answer: Vinogradov's theorem", "{3, 4, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the theorem that states that a large even integer can be written as the sum of a prime and a semiprime. Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept from others, so we can ignore the mention of odd integers. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of the branch of number theory. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Which theorem states that a large even integer can be written as the sum of a semiprime and a prime?\" Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify Chen's theorem as the one that states that a large even integer can be written as the sum of a prime and a semiprime. \nThe answer: Chen's theorem", "{1, 2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture).\" Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, which helps us understand that twin primes are pairs of primes with difference 2. Rule 2 is relevant because it establishes that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X, which helps us understand that the twin prime conjecture holds that there are an infinite number of pairs of primes with difference 2. Rule 7 is relevant because it establishes that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which helps us understand that \"an infinite amount of twin primes\" is synonymous with \"infinitely many twin primes.\" Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer, which helps us understand that the question is asking for a conjecture that holds that there is an infinite amount of twin primes. \nThe", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it defines the concept of twin primes as pairs of primes with a difference of 2. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes the concept of twin primes from other conjectures about the distribution of primes. \nThe answer: A pair of primes with a difference of 2.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific conjecture that involves pairs of consecutive primes with a certain difference. Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that if A has more of something than B, then B has less of that thing than A. Rule 2 is relevant because it explains that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is most/least X and B is least/most X. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as size and profession. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality. Rule 7 is relevant because the question contains synonyms for words in the context paragraph. Rule 13 is relevant because names are equally important for the answer. The answer: Polignac's conjecture.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the form of the primes is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"form\" can be understood as \"type\" or \"pattern\". The answer is \"of the form n2 + 1\".", "{3, 4, 8, 12, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the conjecture that talks about the minimum number of primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Rule 3 tells us that we should not confuse different concepts, such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 4 tells us that we should not confuse profession and nationality. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, we can use it to understand that if Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2, then the opposite is also true: if there are less than four primes, then Brocard's conjecture is false. Rule 12 tells us that we can ignore irrelevant passages in the context. Therefore, the answer is Brocard's conjecture. \n\nThe answer: Brocard's conjecture", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that number theory, and specifically the study of prime numbers, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics. This implies that there was another general theory that was considered the official example of pure mathematics, but it is not mentioned. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to infer that this other theory is a different concept from number theory and prime numbers. We can also use rule 4 to infer that this theory is not related to a profession or nationality. The answer is not provided in the passage.", "{rule list} 1, 4, 17, 19, 20, 21\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a mathematician who took pride in doing work with no military significance. Rule 4 applies because the answer is a profession. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation (\"no military significance\"). Rules 19, 20, and 21 apply because the question asks for a person's name and the gender of the mathematician is irrelevant. \nThe answer: G. H. Hardy", "{rule list: 2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for when prime numbers were discovered to have an application in public key cryptography. Rule 2 applies because \"discovered\" is a synonym for \"found\" and \"applied\" is a synonym for \"used\". Rule 7 applies because \"public key cryptography algorithms\" is a synonym for \"applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic\". Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic\". \nThe answer: 1970s", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.\nThe answer: hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.", "{3, 4, 5, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is also irrelevant. The rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, but it is relevant because it tells us that prime numbers are not vehicles. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if prime numbers are used for pseudorandom number generators, then non-prime numbers are used for non-pseudorandom number generators. Therefore, the answer is: pseudorandom number generators.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to determine what type of decimal 1/p will always be assuming p is a prime other than 2 or 5. According to Fermat's little theorem, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p-1 or a divisor of p-1. Therefore, the answer is a recurring decimal with a period of p-1 or a divisor of p-1. \nThe answer: a recurring decimal with a period of p-1 or a divisor of p-1.", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: If p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p \u2212 1 or a divisor of p \u2212 1. \nThe answer: p-1", "{5, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the condition for an integer p > 1 to be considered prime according to Wilson's theorem. Rule 5 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is irrelevant to this question. Rule 16 tells us that \"if A had profession X but changed to profession Y, then A has profession Y,\" which is also irrelevant. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because Wilson's theorem states that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p. Therefore, the answer is (p-1)!", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: (n-1)!", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a condition that must be satisfied in order for 1/p to be expressed in base q instead of base 10 and still have a period of p - 1. This means that p cannot be a prime factor of q. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply. \nThe answer: p cannot be a prime factor of q.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The article discusses public-key cryptography algorithms, which are a type of encryption method. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is relevant because it emphasizes that the question should not be confused with the article's discussion of algorithms. The answer is \"public-key cryptography algorithms.\"", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The question asks for another type of public key cryptography algorithm, so rule 1 applies to understand that \"another\" means different from the ones mentioned in the article (RSA and Diffie-Hellman). Rule 4 applies to understand that \"type\" refers to a different algorithm, not just a variation of the same algorithm. \nThe answer: There are many other types of public key cryptography algorithms, but the article does not provide any specific examples.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so the number of bits in the primes used for RSA is not related to any other aspect of the article. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if 512-bit primes are frequently used for RSA, then the answer is that 512 bits are often in the primes used for RSA public key cryptography algorithms.\nThe answer: 512 bits", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the type of exponentiation used in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The passage states that the Diffie-Hellman key exchange relies on efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, which implies that modular exponentiation is the type of exponentiation used. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so it is not relevant that the exponentiation is \"large\" or that the primes used are of a certain size. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so it is not relevant that the reverse operation (discrete logarithm) is a hard problem. \nThe answer: modular exponentiation", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so we need to pay attention to the specific size mentioned in the article. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if 1024-bit primes are typical for Diffie-Hellman, then smaller numbers of bits are less typical. \nThe answer: 1024", "3, 8, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that cicadas emerge after 7, 13, or 17 years is not related to their type. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the cicadas emerge at prime number intervals to avoid predators, then non-prime number intervals would make them more vulnerable to predators. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so it is important to note that the use of prime numbers makes it difficult for predators to evolve, rather than making it easier. Therefore, the answer is cicadas. \n\nThe answer: cicadas", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" are relevant because they help us identify the relevant information in the passage. The answer is \"underground\" and this is found in the sentence \"These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground.\" \nThe answer: underground", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the question asks for a \"year interval\" indicates that it is not referring to size, shape, or color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the question asks for an \"other\" interval, it implies that 7 and 13 are already mentioned. Therefore, the answer is 17. \n\nThe answer: 17", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The cicadas' prime number intervals between emergences make it difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Therefore, the logic behind the cicadas' prime number evolutionary strategy is to make it difficult for predators to evolve. The answer is to make it difficult for predators to evolve.", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If the advantage of prime-numbered life-cycles is that it makes it difficult for predators to evolve to specialize in preying on Magicicadas, then if cicadas appeared at non-prime number intervals, predator populations would be higher. Therefore, if cicada outbreaks occurred at 14 and 15 year intervals, predator populations would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. \nThe answer: up to 2% higher", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The word \"prime\" generally suggests minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense, and also that any object can be essentially uniquely decomposed into its prime components.\nThe answer: Minimality or indecomposability", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the concept of \"prime\" in the context of a field is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1, then any larger subfield of F would be more complex than the prime field. Therefore, the answer is: the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1.", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The passage explains that in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that cannot be decomposed into the knot sum of two nontrivial knots, and any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots. Therefore, any knot can be distinctively indicated by its prime components.\nThe answer: by its prime components", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components.\" This means that in addition to indicating minimality or indecomposability, the word prime is also used to indicate that an object can be decomposed into its prime components. \nThe answer: any object can be decomposed into its prime components.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other concepts, and knot theory deals with the shape of knots. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, if a knot is indecomposable, it means that it cannot be decomposed into two nontrivial knots, making it more minimal or less decomposable than other knots. \nThe answer: It cannot be decomposed into two nontrivial knots.", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction, and multiplication are defined. This is a definition of a commutative ring, which is a mathematical structure that satisfies these properties. Rules 3 and 4 are relevant because they clarify that concepts like size, shape, age, color, profession, and nationality are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: commutative ring", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that prime numbers give rise to two general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring R: prime elements and irreducible elements. Therefore, the answer is either \"prime elements\" or \"irreducible elements\". However, since the question asks for only one general concept, either answer is acceptable. \nThe answer: prime elements or irreducible elements", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" and the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" are not relevant to this question. The answer is found in the passage, which explains that prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring R: prime elements and irreducible elements. Therefore, the answer is \"irreducible elements.\"", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two elements based on a comparative attribute. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts. The answer: p must divide either x or y if it divides the product xy.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. The question asks about the condition that makes an element irreducible, which is a concept related to algebraic structure and not related to size, shape, age, or color. Therefore, rule 3 applies. Additionally, rule 8 applies because the question asks about the condition that makes an element irreducible, which is the opposite of the condition that makes an element prime. Therefore, the answer is \"if it cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article discusses the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and its validity in unique factorization domains. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and not interchangeable. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, since the article discusses the validity of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in unique factorization domains, we can infer that it remains valid in these domains. \nThe answer: The fundamental theorem of arithmetic", "3, 4, 5\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that Z[i] is a set of complex numbers is not relevant to the answer. The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Z[i] is a set of complex numbers with specific properties is not relevant to the answer. The rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the fact that Z[i] is a set of complex numbers is not relevant to the answer. The answer is \"Gaussian integers Z[i].\" \n\nThe answer: Gaussian integers Z[i].", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that shape is a different concept from size, age, and color is not relevant to this question. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B is relevant because the question asks for the form of complex Gaussian integers, and the passage describes them as being of the form a + bi, where a and b are arbitrary integers. The answer is: complex numbers of the form a + bi where a and b are arbitrary integers.", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The article defines Gaussian integers as complex numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are arbitrary integers. \nThe answer: real and imaginary parts of a complex number", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer that rational primes are prime numbers. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if rational primes of the form 4k + 3 are Gaussian primes, then rational primes of the form 4k + 1 are not Gaussian primes. \nThe answer: not Gaussian primes", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question, and the rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is only tangentially relevant. The relevant rules are that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" and that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts.\" These rules help us understand that the concepts of \"number\" and \"ideal\" are distinct and not interchangeable, just as animals and vehicles are distinct and not interchangeable. \nThe answer: ring theory", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that prime ideals generalize prime elements in ring theory, and also notes that this is a concept in commutative algebra, which falls under the category of mathematics dealing with abstract structures. Therefore, rules 1 and 3 apply. \nThe answer: prime ideals", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: This question is asking about a specific branch of number theory, which is commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. The passage mentions that prime ideals are an important tool and object of study in these fields. Rules 4 and 8 are relevant because they state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. These rules are relevant because they help us understand that \"number theory\" and \"commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry\" are different concepts, and that the latter is a more specific and specialized field within mathematics. \nThe answer: commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the Lasker-Noether theorem. This means that the Lasker-Noether theorem is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Therefore, we can simplify the fundamental theorem of arithmetic to the Lasker-Noether theorem.\nThe answer: fundamental theorem of arithmetic", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a specific type of commutative ring, so rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) are not relevant. The answer is not affected by the gender of any individuals mentioned, so rule 19 is also not relevant. The answer is simply asking for the type of commutative ring, which is described as \"Noetherian\" in the passage. Therefore, the answer is: Noetherian commutative ring.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that prime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects. This directly answers the question. \nThe answer: prime ideals", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the concept of factorization of prime ideals in both algebraic number theory and geometry, and how they bear resemblance to each other. The question asks what factorization of prime ideals approximates, which can be inferred from the passage as the concept of ramification in both algebraic number theory and geometry. Therefore, rules 3, 7, and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: ramification", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the type of ring where prime ideals can be used for validating quadratic reciprocity. This requires knowledge of algebraic number theory, which is mentioned in the passage. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as factorization and ramification of prime ideals are relevant to this question. Rule 4 tells us that the nationality or profession of individuals mentioned in the passage are not relevant. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question. \nThe answer: ring of integers of quadratic number fields (or any ring of integers, since the passage mentions \"such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers\")", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Quadratic reciprocity is a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations. \nThe answer: It concerns the solvability of quadratic equations.", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the norm getting smaller when a number is multiplied by p means that the norm of the product is less than the norm of the original number. Rule 2 applies because the norm getting smaller for a number multiplied by p means that it is the least norm for that number, while the norm of the original number is the most norm. \nThe answer: The norm gets smaller.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage discusses completing Q with respect to the p-adic norm to yield the field of p-adic numbers, which are essentially all possible ways to complete Q. This local-global principle allows for transferring arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields back and forth to the completed (or local) fields. Therefore, general global fields may be transferred to or from completed (or local) fields. \nThe answer: completed (or local) fields", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: Completing Q with respect to the absolute value will produce the field of real numbers. \nThe answer: absolute value", "{3, 8, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The principle that highlights the significance of primes in number theory is the local-global principle. This principle allows for certain arithmetic questions related to global fields to be transferred back and forth to completed (or local) fields, emphasizing the importance of primes in number theory.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7, 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer involves a French composer who used prime numbers to create ametrical music. The composer's name is mentioned in the article, so rule 13 applies. The question uses the term \"ametrical music\", which is a synonym for \"unpredictable rhythms\" mentioned in the article, so rule 7 applies. The question also specifies that the composer used prime numbers, which is a specific detail mentioned in the article, so rule 3 applies. Finally, the composer's gender is not relevant to the answer, so rule 20 applies.\nThe answer: Olivier Messiaen", "{rule list: 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Messiaen is a French composer who used prime numbers to create ametrical music. One of his works is La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur. \nThe answer: La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for another piece created by Olivier Messiaen, which implies that he has already created at least one piece mentioned in the article. Rule 16 helps us understand that \"another\" refers to a second or additional piece, and not the first one mentioned. Rule 23 helps us understand that the sentence structure is passive, with Messiaen as the subject and the pieces as the objects. \nThe answer: La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur and Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that Messiaen used primes 41, 43, 47, and 53 in the third \u00e9tude of Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme to create unpredictable rhythms. This means that the primes appear in the third \u00e9tude.\nThe answer: third", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the movements of nature", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine river \"begins in the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden in the southeastern Swiss Alps.\"\nThe answer: Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the location where the Rhine river empties. Rule 3 tells us that location is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 16 tells us that \"last comes after first,\" so we know that the answer will come after the information about where the river begins. \nThe answer: The Rhine empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the largest city that the Rhine runs through, which is Cologne. The passage also mentions other countries and borders that the Rhine forms, but those are not relevant to the question. The passage also provides additional information about the length and average discharge of the river, but those are also not relevant to the question.\nThe answer: Cologne", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept, so we cannot assume that length or size is the same as being larger. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the Rhine is not the largest river, then there is another river that is larger. \nThe answer: the Danube", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so we can use it to extract the length of the Rhine. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can use it to infer that if the Rhine is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe, then the Danube is the longest. \nThe answer: about 1,230 km (760 mi)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the location of the Rhine river. Rule 3 tells us that location is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 16 tells us that when answering a question about location, we should provide a concise and minimal answer. \nThe answer: The Rhine river flows through several countries in Europe, including Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Germany, and France, and empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine river \"eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.\"\nThe answer: Netherlands", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so we can't assume that the length of the river is related to any other information in the article. Rule 8 tells us that if we know the average discharge of the river, we can use it to determine the length of the river. The article states that the Rhine has an average discharge of about 2,900 m3/s, so we can use this information to determine that the river is about 1,230 km (760 mi) long.\nThe answer: about 1,230 km (760 mi)", "{3, 10, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that color is a different concept from size, shape, age, and so on. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: The name Rhine is derived from the Gaulish name R\u0113nos.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the French name of the Rhine, which is a name for a geographical location. Therefore, rule 3 applies, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Rule 8 also applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the French name for the Rhine is \"Rhin,\" which is spelled with an \"h\" due to the influence of Greek orthography. Therefore, the answer is \"Rhin.\" \nThe answer: Rhin", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the Proto-Germanic adaptation of the name of the Rhine, which is a historical and linguistic concept. Rule 3 states that concepts such as language and history are different from physical attributes such as size and color. Rule 16 states that in a list, the first item comes before the last item. Therefore, the answer is *R\u012bnaz.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The article states that the Gaulish name R\u0113nos was adapted in Roman-era geography (1st century BC) as Greek \u1fec\u1fc6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (Rh\u0113nos), Latin Rhenus.\nThe answer: 1st century BC", "{3, 8, 12}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 8 (antonyms), and 12 (irrelevant passages). The question asks for the origin of the name \"The Rhine,\" which is answered by the passage explaining that the name is derived from the Gaulish name R\u0113nos, which was adapted in Roman-era geography as Greek \u1fec\u1fc6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (Rh\u0113nos), Latin Rhenus. Therefore, the answer is \"the Gaulish name R\u0113nos.\"", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The name of the Rhine in French is \"Rhin\".\nThe answer: Rhin", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"languages are different concepts\" (3) is relevant because the question asks for the name of the Rhine in Dutch. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" (8) is also relevant because the article explains that the spelling with \"Rh-\" in German and French is due to the influence of Greek orthography, while the Dutch name is spelled \"Rijn\". \nThe answer: Rijn", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and Rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A) are irrelevant to the question. Rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant because it helps identify the correct name for the Proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name. \nThe answer: *R\u012bnaz", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks for the original spelling of the Dutch name, so we need to use the antonym of \"formerly also spelled Rhijn\" which is \"originally spelled.\" Rule 16 is also relevant because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The answer is: \"Rhijn.\"", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if one method of measurement is more commonly used, then the other method is less commonly used. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of length and method of measurement. \nThe answer: \"Rhine-kilometers\" (Rheinkilometer)", "{1, 16, 22}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it deals with comparative measurements, which is what the question is asking for. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the order of events is important, and the question is asking for a specific point in time. Rule 22 is relevant because it establishes that \"introduced\" refers to the first entity mentioned, which in this case is the scale to measure the Rhine.\nThe answer: 1939", "{1, 3, 12}\nExplanation: We need to identify where the measurement of the Rhine river begins. Rule 1 tells us that we can use the antonym of \"conventionally measured\" to determine that the natural course of the river is not where the measurement begins. Rule 3 tells us that size and location are different concepts, so we can ignore the information about the river's length being shortened. Rule 12 tells us that irrelevant information can be ignored. Therefore, the answer is \"Old Rhine Bridge at Constance\". \nThe answer: Old Rhine Bridge at Constance", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine river's measurement ends at Hoek van Holland.\nThe answer: Hoek van Holland", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the length of the Rhine river is significantly shortened from its natural course due to canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century. This means that the canalisation projects have shortened the river.\nThe answer: canalisation projects", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the length of the Rhine is conventionally measured in \"Rhine-kilometers\". Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the measurement, which is a concept related to size. \nThe answer: \"Rhine-kilometers\"", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that the scale for measuring the length of the Rhine was introduced in 1939.\nThe answer: 1939", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article does not mention any information about the beginning of the Rhine, so rule 3 applies. Rule 16 indicates that if the answer is not found in the article, then it cannot be answered. \nThe answer: N/A", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine's length has been significantly shortened due to canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century. This means that the river's natural course was altered, resulting in a shorter length.\nThe answer: Canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine's length is measured from the Old Rhine Bridge at Constance to Hoek van Holland, which means that Hoek van Holland is the endpoint of the Rhine.\nThe answer: Hoek van Holland", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the river makes a distinctive turn to the north near Chur.\nThe answer: north", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the section of the Rhine near Chur is \"nearly 86 km long.\" This information directly answers the question.\nThe answer: nearly 86 km long", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine flows through a wide glacial alpine valley known as the Rhine Valley. This answer is concise and minimal.\nThe answer: Rhine Valley", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes a natural dam near Sargans that prevents the Rhine from flowing into the open Seeztal valley. \nThe answer: a natural dam", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine forms the border between Switzerland to the West and Liechtenstein and later Austria to the East. Therefore, the answer is Austria.\nThe answer: Austria", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the river makes a distinctive turn to the north near Chur.\" This indicates that the turn occurs near the town of Chur.\nThe answer: Near Chur.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the section that turns north is the one mentioned after the previous sentence. \nThe answer: nearly 86 km long", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that height is a different concept from shape, age, and color, and rule 16, which states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" The question asks for the height of a specific section of the river, so we can use rule 16 to determine that the section being referred to is the one that descends from a height of 599 m to 396 m. Therefore, the answer is 599 m. \nThe answer: 599 m.", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the river flows through a wide glacial alpine valley known as the Rhine Valley (German: Rheintal).\nThe answer: the Rhine Valley", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine forms the border between Switzerland to the West and Liechtenstein and later Austria to the East. Therefore, the answer is Liechtenstein. \nThe answer: Liechtenstein", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the mouth of the Rhine forming an inland delta, which is delimited by the Alter Rhein in the West and a modern canalized section in the East. The delta includes the Austrian towns of Gai\u00dfau, H\u00f6chst, and Fu\u00dfach and is a nature reserve and bird sanctuary. The passage does not mention any specific lake, but it does mention that the delta is formed by the mouth of the Rhine, so the answer is Lake Constance.\nThe answer: Lake Constance", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the delta is delimited in the West by the Alter Rhein. This means that the western boundary of the delta is formed by the Alter Rhein.\nThe answer: the Alter Rhein", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Rhine delta being delimited in the West by the Alter Rhein and in the East by a modern canalized section. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the delta's shape or size. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the delta is delimited in the East by a modern canalized section.\nThe answer: a modern canalized section.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the answer to the question is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means that the answer may be a synonym of a word used in the passage. The answer: \"Isel\".", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Donkey", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the mouth of the Rhine forms an inland delta, and this delta is into Lake Constance. The location of the delta is also described as being delimited by the Alter Rhein in the West and a modern canalized section in the East. Therefore, the answer is Lake Constance.\nThe answer: Lake Constance", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the delta is delimited in the West by the Alter Rhein and in the East by a modern canalized section. This means that the eastern boundary of the delta is formed by a modern canalized section. \nThe answer: a modern canalized section.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the delta is delimited in the West by the Alter Rhein (\"Old Rhine\"), which means that the Old Rhine forms the western boundary of the delta.\nThe answer: The Alter Rhein", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes how the natural Rhine river branched off into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments. These islands are located in Austria and are referred to in the local Alemannic dialect as \"Isel.\" Therefore, the answer is: small islands.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"Isel\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: near Diepoldsau", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a canal at Fu\u00dfach", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that there was also strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta, which was another reason for the regulation of the Rhine.\nThe answer: Strong sedimentation", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Dornbirner Ach was diverted and now flows parallel to the canalized Rhine into the lake. Therefore, the Rhine now flows into the lake. \nThe answer: into the lake", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Sediment will cause the lake to silt up.\nThe answer: The lake will silt up.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that a regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fu\u00dfach. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, rule 12 states that irrelevant passages should be ignored, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, the answer is Fu\u00dfach. \nThe answer: Fu\u00dfach.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the regulation of the Rhine was called for in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta. This implies that the Rhine needed to be regulated because it was causing flooding and sedimentation. \nThe answer: To counteract flooding and sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta.", "{rule list: 1, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that \"A regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau.\" This means that the Rhine was regulated with an upper canal near Diepoldsau.\nThe answer: Diepoldsau", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Dornbirner Ach", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Size and color are different concepts, so the mention of the darker color of the Dornbirner Ach is irrelevant. The negation in the question (\"what will cause\") is important. \nThe answer: continuous input of sediment into the lake", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Lake Constance consists of three bodies of water: the Obersee, the Untersee, and the Seerhein. \nThe answer: 3", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: \"Untersee\" is a German word that translates to \"lower lake\".\nThe answer: \"lower lake\"", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The rule about locations being important for the answer is relevant because the question asks for the name of a specific lake. The rule about different concepts (in this case, bodies of water) is also relevant. \nThe answer: Seerhein", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The location of the border is important for the answer.\nThe answer: Swiss-Austrian border", "{rule list: size, shape, age, and color are different concepts}\nExplanation: The word \"Obersee\" is a name and refers to a specific body of water in Lake Constance.\nThe answer: Upper lake", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Lake Constance consists of three bodies of water: the Obersee, the Untersee, and the Seerhein. \nThe answer: Three", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The passage states that Lake Constance is situated in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. Therefore, the answer is Austria. \nThe answer: Austria", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The article states that Lake Constance is situated \"near the Alps,\" which indicates that it is by a mountainous region.\nThe answer: the Alps", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine flows into Lake Constance from the south following the Swiss-Austrian border. This means that the border between Switzerland and Austria is located to the south of Lake Constance.\nThe answer: To the south of Lake Constance.", "{3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the state that is separated from Bavaria by Lake Constance. Rule 3 tells us that location is important for the answer. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we can identify that the answer is not in the irrelevant information about the lake itself, but rather in the list of states and cantons where its shorelines lie. The first state listed is Bavaria and the last one is Thurgau, so the state separated from Bavaria by Lake Constance is Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe answer: Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and size are different concepts is irrelevant, as is the rule about antonyms. The relevant rule is that concepts such as \"why\" questions do not have synonyms in the context paragraph. The answer is: because of the greater density of cold water.", "{3, 5, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the specific lake that receives a fraction of the Rhine's flow, which is mentioned as \"diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake \u00dcberlingen\". We can use rule 3 to differentiate between the two lakes mentioned in the passage (Upper Lake and Lake \u00dcberlingen). Rule 5 helps us differentiate between animals and locations, and rule 13 tells us that locations are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: Lake \u00dcberlingen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking where the cold and warm water meet. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible factors for where the waters meet. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the cold water doesn't mix with the warmer water at first, then they eventually do mix. Therefore, the answer is: at first, the cold water doesn't mix with the warmer water.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the flow of Rhine water reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau. Therefore, you can see the flow of the lake connecting with the Rhine from the German islands. However, the passage does not provide information on how much of the lake connecting with the Rhine can be seen from the German islands. \nThe answer: Not specified.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage describes the meeting point of the cold, gray mountain water and the warmer, green waters of Upper Lake at the Rheinbrech, which causes the Rhine water to abruptly fall into the depths due to the greater density of cold water. The flow reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau. Therefore, the answer is Lindau. \nThe answer: Lindau", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is relevant because it establishes that \"cold water\" and \"Lake Constance\" are different concepts. Rule 8 is also relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks where the cold water mixes with Lake Constance, implying that the cold water is a smaller part of the whole. Therefore, the answer is that the cold water mixes with Lake Constance at the Rheinbrech, where it falls into the depths due to the greater density of cold water.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the island that the cold water flow of the Rhine and Lake Constance reaches. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about the color or size of the island is not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the cold water flow appears at the northern (German) shore of the lake, then it does not appear at the southern (Swiss) shore. Therefore, the answer is Lindau. \nThe answer: Lindau", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that \"A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake \u00dcberlingen.\" This indicates that a small fraction of the cold water flow from Lake Constance goes to Lake \u00dcberlingen.\nThe answer: Lake \u00dcberlingen", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: The word \"Rheinrinne\" is a German word mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: \"Rhine Gutter\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the water level", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the Rhine flows \"generally westward\" after emerging from Lake Constance. Rule 3 applies to clarify that \"westward\" refers to the direction of flow, which is a different concept from the location of Lake Constance. \nThe answer: westward", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The question asks for the major tributary of the Rhine, which is the river Aare. This is a question about geography and the relevant rules are that size and shape are different concepts (rule 3) and that animals and vehicles are different concepts (rule 5). \nThe answer: the river Aare.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is relevant because it clarifies that water discharge is a different concept from the size or shape of the river. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks for the amount of water that the Aare gives to the Rhine, which is the opposite of the usual way of expressing the relationship between two rivers. \nThe answer: nearly 1,000 m3/s (35,000 cu ft/s)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about what \"highest point\" means in this context. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the highest point mentioned in the passage is the summit of Finsteraarhorn. \nThe answer: The summit of Finsteraarhorn.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question is asking for a specific location. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is also relevant because the question is asking for a specific point in the river's path. \nThe answer: Basel", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The direction of the Rhine's flow is a matter of direction, which falls under rule 3. The passage states that the Rhine emerges from Lake Constance and flows generally westward, which means it flows in a westerly direction. This is also confirmed by the mention of the Rhine forming the German-Swiss border until it turns north at Basel, which indicates that it flows in a westerly direction before turning north. This order of events also follows rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: westward", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Aare more than doubles the Rhine's water discharge is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What is the river that provides more than a fifth of the discharge at the Dutch border and joins the Rhine as its major tributary?\" The answer is the river Aare.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size and quantity are different concepts, so rule 3 applies. The question asks for a specific amount of water, so rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: more than doubles the Rhine's water discharge, to an average of nearly 1,000 m3/s (35,000 cu ft/s)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Aare river contains the waters from the summit of Finsteraarhorn, which is the highest point of the Rhine basin.\nThe answer: Finsteraarhorn", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine forms the German-Swiss border from Lake Constance, with the exception of certain areas. Therefore, the answer is Germany. \nThe answer: Germany", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Basel is located in the centre of the Rhine and is the first major city in the course of the stream.\nThe answer: Basel", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other concepts, so any information about the shape of the bend is irrelevant. Rule 16 states that the first location mentioned in the passage is located before the second location. \nThe answer: Rhine knee", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Legally, the Central Bridge is the boundary between High and Upper Rhine.\" This means that the boundary between the High and Upper Rhine is the Central Bridge.\nThe answer: Central Bridge", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about the length of the Upper Rhine Plain should be directly stated in the article. The article states that the Upper Rhine Plain is about 300 km long, so the answer is 300 km.", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: Size is a different concept from shape, so we cannot assume that the length mentioned in the passage is the same as the width. Typos are irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: up to 40 km wide.", "{rule list: locations are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a city, which is a location. Therefore, the relevant rule is that locations are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Basel", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes a major bend in the Rhine where its overall direction changes from West to North, located in the centre of Basel. Since this is the first major bend in the Rhine, it can be inferred that this is what the question is referring to. Additionally, the passage mentions that this bend is known as the \"Rhine knee\". \nThe answer: The first major bend in the Rhine is called the \"Rhine knee\".", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the \"overall direction of the Rhine changes from West to North\" at the Rhine knee. \nThe answer: North", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The \"High Rhine\" ends at the bend in the Rhine.\nThe answer: High Rhine", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Central Bridge is the boundary between High and Upper Rhine.\nThe answer: Central Bridge", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine straightening program occurred in the 19th Century.\nThe answer: 19th", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the rate of flow was increased", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the ground water level in the Rhine during the straightening program. Rule 3 reminds us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is: the ground water level fell significantly.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that on the French side, the Grand Canal d'Alsace was dug to carry a significant part of the river water and all of the traffic. \nThe answer: Grand Canal d'Alsace", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a large compensation pool", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that the Upper Rhine region was changed significantly by the Rhine straightening program in the 19th Century.\nThe answer: The Upper Rhine region.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in the 19th Century (specific date not given)", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the article states that the rate of flow was increased. The rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about the rate of flow, which is a different concept from the other changes mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: The rate of flow was increased.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the ground water level fell significantly\" due to the Rhine straightening program.\nThe answer: It fell significantly.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that any animal could carry the Rhine flow through France. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is irrelevant to this question. Therefore, the answer is: the Grand Canal d'Alsace.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Neckar is one of the Rhine's main tributaries and that it encounters it \"here,\" which refers to the location mentioned in the previous sentence, where the article discusses the Rhine's encounter with its main tributaries. Additionally, the order in which the tributaries are listed implies that the Neckar is encountered before the Main and the Moselle. \nThe answer: \"here\" (referring to the location where the Rhine encounters its main tributaries, including the Neckar)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the average discharge of the Moselle is not related to its size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the Moselle contributes an average discharge of more than 300 m3/s to the Rhine, then the Rhine has an average discharge of less than 300 m3/s to the Moselle. \nThe answer: more than 300 m3/s", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the longest river in Germany. Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept from other attributes, so we can focus on identifying the river's name. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can assume that the first river mentioned in the article is the one we are looking for. Therefore, the answer is: The Rhine.", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question specifically asks for a tributary that goes through Northeastern France and part of Belgium. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: the Moselle", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the Rhine has an average width of 400 m (1,300 ft).\" Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, and rule 16 states that when a measurement is given, it should be taken as the answer.\nThe answer: 400 m (1,300 ft)", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine is the longest river in Germany.\nThe answer: Germany", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to the question. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to the question. The rule that animals and vehicles are different concepts is not relevant to the question. The answer is: Germany.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we cannot assume that a larger tributary contributes more. We use rule 8 to infer that if one tributary contributes more than another, then the other contributes less. Therefore, the answer is not explicitly stated in the article.", "{3, 14}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Moselle is a tributary of the Rhine and that it drains northeastern France, most of Luxembourg, and a small part of Belgium. Therefore, the Moselle takes the Rhine to these countries.\nThe answer: northeastern France, Luxembourg, and a small part of Belgium", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to find the amount of discharge at the Dutch border, which is a quantitative measure. Therefore, we apply rule 3 to ensure that size and quantity are not confused with color or shape. We also apply rule 8 to understand that if A has more X than B, then B has more antonym(X) than A, and A has less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: 2,290 m3/s (81,000 cu ft/s)", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The Middle Rhine flows between Bingen and Bonn.\nThe answer: Middle Rhine", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Middle Rhine flowing through the Rhine Gorge between Bingen and Bonn. \nThe answer: the Rhine Gorge", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine Gorge was created by erosion. This fits with rule 3, which states that shape is a different concept from other characteristics, and rule 9, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, erosion is the opposite of formation, so the erosion created the gorge. \nThe answer: The Rhine Gorge was formed by erosion.", "{3, 13, 14}\nExplanation: The passage describes an area called the Middle Rhine, which flows through the Rhine Gorge and is known for its many castles and vineyards. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and known as \"the Romantic Rhine\". \nThe answer: the Romantic Rhine", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Middle Rhine flowing through the Rhine Gorge between Bingen and Bonn.\nThe answer: Middle Rhine", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that Bingen comes before Bonn. Therefore, the answer is \"the Rhine Gorge\".", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The Rhine Gorge is known for its many castles and vineyards, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the Middle Ages and many quaint and lovely country villages.\nThe answer: its many castles and vineyards", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the section of the Middle Rhine flowing through the Rhine Gorge is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is known as \"the Romantic Rhine.\"\nThe answer: the Romantic Rhine", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that until the early 1980s, industry was a major source of water pollution in the Rhine. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and cannot be compared. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, the answer is industry. \nThe answer: Industry", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule about locations being important for the answer tells us that we need to identify the location mentioned in the article that is home to Europe's largest inland port. The rule about first coming before last tells us that if multiple locations are mentioned, we should look for the first one mentioned. Therefore, the answer is Duisburg. \nThe answer: Duisburg.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg...\" \nThe answer: The Ruhr", "{3, 4, 5, 6}\nExplanation: The Ruhr provides the region with drinking water.\nThe answer: drinking water", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the passage states that \"although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated.\" The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" applies because the question asks about the location of the factories, not their size, shape, age, or color.\nThe answer: Along the Lower Rhine.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"industry was a major source of water pollution\" until the early 1980s. This implies that industry caused water pollution in the Rhine. Therefore, we apply rules 3 (different concepts) and 17 (negations are important for the answer) to determine that the answer is: Industry caused water pollution in the Rhine.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that \"section\" and \"factories\" are different concepts. Then we use rule 8 to infer that if the Lower Rhine has the bulk of the factories, then the other sections of the Rhine have fewer factories. \nThe answer: The Lower Rhine.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, but it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, passing the major cities of Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf, and Duisburg. The article does not mention any specific country having the most factories that pollute the Rhine. \nThe answer: The article does not provide a specific answer to the question.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Duisburg is the home of Europe's largest inland port. This satisfies rule 3, which states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: Duisburg", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of a river that joins the Rhine in Duisburg. Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as location are important for the answer. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, the answer is the Ruhr. \nThe answer: Ruhr", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the dominant economic sectors in the Middle Rhine area are viniculture and tourism. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible dominant economic sectors. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate nationality as a possible dominant economic sector. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can infer that \"tourism\" is a synonym for \"Rhine romanticism,\" which is mentioned in the passage. \nThe answer: Tourism", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lorelei", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Middle Rhine Valley as having outstanding architectural monuments, slopes full of vines, settlements crowded on narrow river banks, and scores of castles lined up along steep slopes. These elements are associated with the romanticism of the Rhine. \nThe answer: The Middle Rhine Valley", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the dominant economic sector in the Middle Rhine area, which is mentioned in the passage. The passage states that \"The dominant economic sectors in the Middle Rhine area are viniculture and tourism.\" Therefore, we can use rule 3 to understand that viniculture and tourism are two different concepts and rule 13 to understand that both are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: tourism", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine Gorge between R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein and Koblenz is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe answer: a UNESCO World Heritage Site", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine Gorge is between R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein and Koblenz, so the answer is R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein.\nThe answer: R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lorelei", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the Middle Rhine area, which includes the famous rock Lorelei. The question specifically asks for the location of the rock. Rule 3 states that location is an important concept for answering questions. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages can be ignored. \nThe answer: Near Sankt Goarshausen", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that we should pay attention to the specific location mentioned in the article. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" means that we should not confuse the size of the port with the size of the city. The answer: Duisburg.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The Wesel-Datteln Canal is a shipping route that runs parallel to the Lippe and is located in Wesel. \nThe answer: a shipping route", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and location are different concepts means that the mention of the Lippe river is irrelevant to the answer. The rule that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer means that the information about the Emmerich Rhine Bridge and the Uerdingen line is also irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is: the Lippe.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Between Emmerich and Cleves the Emmerich Rhine Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in Germany, crosses the 400 m wide river.\" This answer follows rules 3 and 16, which state that size and locations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Emmerich Rhine Bridge", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Emmerich Rhine Bridge crosses the 400 m wide river between Emmerich and Cleves.\nThe answer: 400m", "{rule list: 13, 14}\nExplanation: The article discusses the Lower Rhine, which is the part of the Rhine that flows through North Rhine-Westphalia. \nThe answer: Lower Rhine", "{3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question is asking for the name of a region. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" is also relevant because the question is asking for a specific name. Finally, the rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because the question is asking for the name of a specific region. \nThe answer: Rhine-Ruhr region", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Duisburg has the largest river port in Europe, called Duisport.\nThe answer: Duisport", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the length of the bridge is relevant to the answer. The passage also provides specific information about the Emmerich Rhine Bridge being the longest suspension bridge in Germany. \nThe answer: Emmerich Rhine Bridge", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the geography and cities along the Rhine river in Germany, but does not directly state the width of the river. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so information about the river's width must be explicitly stated. Rule 12 states that irrelevant information should be ignored. \nThe answer: The passage does not provide information about the width of the Rhine in Germany.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the water flow of the Rhine flows through the Waal and then merges with the Meuse, so the answer is the Meuse. \nThe answer: the Meuse", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the Dutch name Rijn no longer coincides with the main flow of water,\" implying that there may be confusion about the name. Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that \"two thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west, through the Waal,\" indicating that the Rhine is still a significant part of the river system. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the name of the Rhine in Dutch, and the article provides that information.\nThe answer: Rijn", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that two-thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows through the Waal, then we can infer that one-third of the water flow volume of the Rhine does not flow through the Waal. Therefore, the answer is one-third. \nThe answer: One-third.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if two thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west, then one third flows east. \nThe answer: east", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that two thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if two thirds of the Rhine flows farther west, then one third flows through Germany. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer is Germany. \nThe answer: Germany.", "{3, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify what body of water the Rhine merges with outside of Germany. Rule 3 tells us that concepts like size and shape are different, so we can ignore those details. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What body of water does the Rhine flow into outside of Germany?\" Rule 12 tells us that irrelevant information can be ignored, so we can ignore the details about the different branches of the river. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to note that the Rhine does not flow directly into the North Sea. \nThe answer: The Rhine flows into the North Sea via the Waal, Merwede, Nieuwe Merwede, Hollands Diep, and Haringvliet estuaries, after merging with the Meuse.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how the Rhine river splits into different branches, including the Oude Maas which branches off near Dordrecht. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: Oude Maas", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the two parts of the Rhine's flow. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that \"where\" refers to a location. \nThe answer: the Pannerdens Kanaal and the IJssel and Nederrijn", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow of the Rhine north into the IJsselmeer\" and \"the Nederrijn carries approximately two ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the Waal.\" Later, it is mentioned that \"the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek\" and flows west to \"rejoin the Noord River into the Nieuwe Maas and to the North Sea.\" Therefore, the Rhine redistributes into the Ijssel and the Lek.\nThe answer: Lek", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the passage states that the Nederrijn changes its name at Wijk bij Duurstede, which means that the name change occurs after the Nederrijn and before the Lek. Therefore, the answer is Lek. \nThe answer: Lek", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Nederrijn changes its name to the Lek at Wijk bij Duurstede and flows farther west to rejoin the Noord River into the Nieuwe Maas and to the North Sea.\nThe answer: the Noord River", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the complement of the information given in the article. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves a different branch of the river. \nThe answer: Pannerdens Kanaal", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that the Ijssel and Nederrijn are different concepts. We use rule 8 to infer that since the article mentions the Ijssel, the question is asking for the other location where the water from the Pannerdens Kanaal redistributes. \nThe answer: the Nederrijn", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We apply rule 3 to note that the size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and rule 8 to infer that if the Ijssel carries one ninth of the water flow of the Rhine, then the Waal carries eight ninths of the water flow of the Rhine. \nThe answer: one ninth", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"at Wijk bij Duurstede, the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek.\" This follows rule 3, which states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: Lek", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this passage, the Nederrijn is mentioned before the Lek, indicating that the Nederrijn is the first name and the Lek is the last name.\nThe answer: Wijk bij Duurstede", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article explains that the name \"Rijn\" is used only for smaller streams farther to the north, which together formed the main river Rhine in Roman times. Therefore, the answer is \"Rijn\".\nThe answer: Rijn", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the smaller streams \"are used for draining the surrounding land and polders.\"\nThe answer: draining the surrounding land and polders", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can identify that the old north branch of the Rhine is the Kromme Rijn. \nThe answer: Kromme Rijn", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Kromme Rijn (\"Bent Rhine\")", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the different branches of the Rhine river, and how they have different names. The Old Rhine flows west into a sluice at Katwijk. \nThe answer: Old Rhine", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a natural region in the Netherlands. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we can directly extract the answer from the passage. \nThe answer: Rhine-Meuse Delta", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: near Millingen aan de Rijn", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the Rhine-Meuse Delta is the most important natural region of the Netherlands and that it is also known as the Rhine Delta. However, since the name Rhine Delta is also used for another river delta, it is clearer to call the larger one Rhine-Meuse delta or even Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. Therefore, the nickname for the Delta in the Netherlands is Rhine-Meuse delta.\nThe answer: Rhine-Meuse delta", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that shape and name are different concepts (3) is relevant because the question is asking for a name change. The rule that first comes before last and last comes after first (16) is relevant because the question is asking for the name change after the split. \nThe answer: Waal", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes three main flows that are created by the bifurcations of the Rhine delta. The middle flow begins as Nederrijn, so there is only one main flow that is branched off from the Nederrijn.\nThe answer: one", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the largest main branch of the Rhine, which is a matter of size. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from shape, age, and color, so we can ignore those aspects of the passage. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Which main branch of the Rhine is the most significant in terms of water flow?\" The answer is the Waal, which continues as Boven Merwede, Beneden Merwede, Noord River, Nieuwe Maas, Het Scheur, and Nieuwe Waterweg. \nThe answer: The Waal", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that shape and translation are different concepts, and the rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we need to find the name of the flow that is translated as \"Old Meuse\".\nThe answer: Oude Maas translates to \"Old Meuse\".", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: \"Het Scheur\" is a Dutch term mentioned in the passage. Rule 3 states that shape and language are different concepts, so we can't assume that \"Het Scheur\" is a shape or a location. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for a possible translation of \"Het Scheur\" in the passage. The passage mentions that \"Het Scheur\" is one of the names that the southern main branch of the Rhine delta takes, so we can infer that it refers to a body of water. The English translation of \"Het Scheur\" is \"the Rip\".\nThe answer: the Rip", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage describes the St. Elizabeth's flood in 1421, which impacted the Meuse river.\nThe answer: St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)", "{3, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year in which the St. Elizabeth's flood occurred. Rules 3 and 10 are not relevant to this question. Rule 12 tells us that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important for the answer. The question does not contain any negations, so we can ignore this rule. Therefore, the answer is: 1421.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes the location of the Meuse river before the St. Elizabeth's flood, which is \"just south of today's line Merwede-Oude Maas to the North Sea\". This indicates that the Meuse flowed in a different location before the flood. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as irrelevant. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is also irrelevant. \nThe answer: just south of today's line Merwede-Oude Maas to the North Sea", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: from 1421 to 1904", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an archipelago-like estuary", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: Closed rivers now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders.\nThe answer: drainage channels", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The passage states that the construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th Century. This refers to a man-made construction project that altered the natural hydrography of the Rhine's Delta.\nThe answer: Delta Works", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The term for closing off rivers that are no longer connected is \"dammed\", which is a negation of the concept of open or flowing rivers. Therefore, rule 3 applies. Additionally, the question uses the phrase \"no longer connected\", which is a negation, so rule 17 applies.\nThe answer: dammed", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: in the second half of the 20th Century", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine-Meuse Delta is a \"tidal delta,\" meaning it is shaped by both sedimentation from the rivers and tidal currents. This distinguishes it from other types of deltas, such as river-dominated deltas or wave-dominated deltas.\nThe answer: tidal delta", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Sedimentation of the rivers is shaped by tidal currents.\nThe answer: tidal currents", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: If high tide is a risk, then it means that the water level is higher than usual and can cause damage to the land. This applies rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the risk of high tide is greater than the safety of low tide. It also applies rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, as the risk of high tide is not related to any of these concepts.\nThe answer: High tide can cause damage to the land.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"At the Waal, for example, the most landward tidal influence can be detected between Brakel and Zaltbommel.\" This means that the answer is Zaltbommel.\nThe answer: Zaltbommel", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the present Mediterranean Sea descends from the larger Tethys sea that existed between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates during the Triassic Period. This means that the Tethys sea was the predecessor of the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe answer: Tethys sea", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other concepts, so we can ignore the specific time periods mentioned in the article. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the plates reversed direction in the Jurassic Period. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can determine that the plates were the ones that reversed direction. \nThe answer: The plates reversed direction in the Jurassic Period.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The question asks about the features created by microplates squeezing and rotating, which are related to the shape and geography of the Mediterranean region. Therefore, rule 3 applies. The answer should be the individual features of Mediterranean geography. However, the question also includes the word \"created,\" which implies a positive action, so we need to apply rule 8 to get the correct answer: the microplates squeezing and rotating created the individual features of Mediterranean geography. \nThe answer: the individual features of Mediterranean geography.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that the Tethys Ocean opened between 240 and 220 million years before present, which corresponds to the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era. This information is given in the first sentence of the passage. \nThe answer: Triassic Period", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Pyrenees were pushed up by the movement of the Iberian plate in the Alpine Orogeny. \nThe answer: Iberia", "{rule list: 3, 6, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how the Alpine orogeny caused a N-S rift system to develop in the zone, specifically the Upper Rhine Graben in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands. The answer is the N-S rift system. \nThe answer: N-S rift system", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the Upper Rhine Graben as one of the main elements of the rift system in southwest Germany caused by the Alpine orogeny. \nThe answer: Upper Rhine Graben", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: by the time of the Miocene", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps.\" This means that the Rhone and Danube rivers drained the northern flanks of the Alps.\nThe answer: the Danube", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Rhine extended its watershed southward through stream capture.\nThe answer: through stream capture", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how the Rhine river extended its watershed southward and captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains, including the Mosel, the Main, and the Neckar. It then goes on to say that by the Pliocene period, the Rhine had captured these streams. Therefore, the answer is \"Pliocene period.\"\nThe answer: Pliocene period.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" is relevant because the question is asking about the location of the streams. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are not relevant. \nThe answer: southward, down to the Vosges Mountains, including the Mosel, the Main, the Neckar, the northern Alps, above Lake Constance, the upper reaches of the Main, beyond Schweinfurt, and the Vosges Mountains.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Around 2.5 million years ago\" was the period in question. This means that the period being referred to was in the past, so rule 3 applies. Additionally, the article provides a chronological order of events, starting with the period 2.5 million years ago and ending with the present, so rule 16 applies as well.\nThe answer: the geological period of the Ice Ages", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"six major Ice Ages have occurred.\" Rule 3 applies because \"number\" is a different concept from \"time period.\" Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a quantity, and the answer should reflect that quantity. \nThe answer: six", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the sea level during the Ice Ages to the present day sea level. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of sea level and time period. \nThe answer: 120 m (390 ft)", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. This means that the Rhine flowed in a northwest direction in the early Pleistocene.\nThe answer: northwest", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the location of the mouth of the Rhine river during glacial times, which is a matter of geography. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the size or shape of the river. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know where the mouth of the river is during interglacial times (when sea level is higher), we can infer that during glacial times (when sea level is lower), the mouth would be further offshore. \nThe answer: offshore of Brest, France", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the last glacial ran from ~74,000 BP until the end of the Pleistocene (~11,600 BP). This means that the last glacial started around 74,000 BP.\nThe answer: ~74,000 BP", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the last glacial ran until the end of the Pleistocene, which is estimated to be around 11,600 BP. This means that the last glacial ended around 11,600 years before present.\nThe answer: around 11,600 BP", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The direction of the Rhine river during the last cold phase is a factual detail that can be directly extracted from the passage. Rule 3 applies to ensure that size, shape, age, and color are not confused with direction. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a comparison between two phases, and the answer should reflect the opposite of the phase that is being referred to. \nThe answer: west", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the difference in sea level between the last cold phase and today, which is a comparison of the concept of \"sea level\" between two different time periods. Therefore, we apply rule 3 to recognize that \"sea level\" is a different concept from \"size, shape, age, and color.\" We also apply rule 8 to understand that if the sea level was lower in the past, then it is more antonym(high) than it is today. \nThe answer: approximately 120 meters (390 feet) lower than today.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today,\" so anything related to sea level would be affected. The answer is: the English Channel.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"its source must still have been a glacier\" during the last Ice Age. This implies that the source of the Rhine was a glacier. Additionally, rule 3 states that age is a different concept from size, shape, and color, so it is important to note that the question is asking about the source of the Rhine during the last Ice Age specifically.\nThe answer: a glacier", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"age\" is a different concept from \"size, shape, and color\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being any of those concepts. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" applies because the passage states that ice-sheets covered Scandinavia, the Baltics, Scotland, and the Alps, but left the space between as open tundra. Therefore, the answer is \"open tundra.\" \nThe answer: open tundra", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: ca. 22,000-14,000 yr BP", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from other concepts is relevant because the question asks about what covered certain regions during a specific time period. The rule that typos in the question are irrelevant is also relevant because there is a typo in the question (\"Ice Age\" should be capitalized). \nThe answer: ice-sheets", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"loess\" as the term for wind-blown dust in a tundra.\nThe answer: loess", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that northwest Europe began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward. This means that the warming up process started at least 22,000 years ago. \nThe answer: from 22,000 years ago onward", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the action of frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore those details in the passage. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What did frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers begin to thaw and do?\" The answer is they began to thaw and fall/winter snow covers melted in spring. \nThe answer: They began to thaw and fall/winter snow covers melted in spring.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage describes how as northwest Europe warmed up from the last Ice Age, frozen subsoil and alpine glaciers began to thaw and melt, and much of the resulting discharge flowed into the Rhine and its downstream extension. \nThe answer: the Rhine and its downstream extension.", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions the gradual warming of northwest Europe. Rule 3 applies because the article mentions changes in vegetation. Rule 16 applies because the article mentions specific time periods. \nThe answer: About 13,000 BP.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article describes the gradual warming of northwest Europe from 22,000 years ago onward, with rapid warming and changes of vegetation beginning about 13,000 BP. By 9000 BP, Europe was fully forested. \nThe answer: 9000 BP", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Since 7500 yr ago, a situation with tides and currents, very similar to present has existed.\" This means that the tides and currents similar to our current system began 7500 years ago. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that \"age\" is a different concept from \"size\" or \"shape.\" Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that the tides and currents have existed since 7500 years ago, so we can say that they began 7500 years ago. \nThe answer: 7500 years ago", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Sedimentation by the Rhine compensated the transgression by the sea because the rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far that natural sedimentation and coastal processes could keep up with it. This means that the sea level was roughly at the same location for the last 7000 years. The use of the word \"compensate\" implies that the sedimentation was able to counteract the rise in sea level. The use of the word \"transgression\" implies that the sea level was rising and encroaching on the land. The negation in the question (\"why did... compensate\") indicates that the answer should explain why the sedimentation was able to counteract the rise in sea level. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 are relevant. \nThe answer: Rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes together could compensate the transgression by the sea.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"in the last 7000 years, the coast line was roughly at the same location.\" This means that the coastline has been in the same location for 7000 years.\nThe answer: 7000 years", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage does not provide information on why the sea level is rising, but it does mention that in the southern North Sea, the sea level is still rising due to ongoing tectonic subsidence. Therefore, we can infer that the current sea level is rising due to natural geological processes. \nThe answer: due to ongoing tectonic subsidence", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the article states that the sea level is rising at a rate of 1-3 cm per century, then the answer is that the sea level is rising at a rate of 1-3 cm per century.\nThe answer: 1-3 cm per century", "{rule list: 3, 10, 12}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine occupied its Late-Glacial valley at the beginning of the Holocene, and that the formation of the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta began around 8,000 years ago. This information allows us to determine that the Holocene began approximately 11,700 years ago.\nThe answer: ~11,700 years ago", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides a timeline of events, starting with the beginning of the Holocene and leading up to the formation of the Rhine-Meuse delta. The answer can be found in the second sentence, which states that the formation of the delta began around 8,000 years ago.\nThe answer: ~8,000 years ago", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that \"At the begin of the Holocene (~11,700 years ago), the Rhine occupied its Late-Glacial valley.\" This implies that during the Holocene, the Rhine was not occupying its Late-Glacial valley. Rule 3 applies because \"occupied\" refers to the location of the river, not its size, shape, age, or color. \nThe answer: Late-Glacial valley", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the evolution of the Rhine-Meuse delta, which began around 8,000 years ago during the Holocene. The Rhine river is mentioned as occupying its Late-Glacial valley at the beginning of the Holocene. The passage also mentions the Netherlands, which is where the delta is located.\nThe answer: Netherlands", "{1, 3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that human impact is seen since ~3000 yr BP, indicating that before that time, there was less human impact. Rule 3 applies because the question asks specifically about human impact, which is a different concept than the age of the delta. Rule 7 applies because the question contains a synonym for \"impact\" in the phrase \"started impacting\". Rule 12 applies because some parts of the passage are not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation in the phrase \"when have humans started\". \nThe answer: ~3000 yr BP", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Sediment and delta growth have caused increased flooding and sedimentation.\nThe answer: flooding", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3, which states that different concepts cannot be compared, is relevant. Therefore, we cannot compare what increased in the Rhine with any other concept. Rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B, is also relevant. Therefore, we can infer that if the sediment load of the Rhine strongly increased, then before the land clearance in the upland areas, the sediment load of the Rhine was less. \nThe answer: sediment load", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the embankment of the major Rhine distributaries took place after peat mining and before the digging of canals. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence \"Embankment...took place in the 11-13th century AD\" is in the active voice, with \"embankment\" as the subject and \"took place\" as the verb.\nThe answer: 11-13th century AD", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred.\" This means that there have been 80 avulsions in the past 6000 years.\nThe answer: 80", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks where the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to, so the answer is \"to the North Sea\".", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea. Therefore, the answer is not \"the former Meuse estuary\" but \"the North Sea\". \nThe answer: the North Sea", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article describes the different branches of the Rhine river and where they discharge. The Ijssel branch flows to the north and enters the IJsselmeer.\nThe answer: IJsselmeer", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We can use rule 3 to determine that \"Zuider Zee\" refers to a body of water, and rule 8 to understand that \"change\" is the opposite of \"formerly.\" Therefore, the answer is \"freshwater lake.\" \nThe answer: freshwater lake", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the Rhine branches into three branches is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that the Rhine has three branches, we can infer that it does not have only one or two branches. \nThe answer: three", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The article provides historical information about the Rhine river, but does not mention a specific discovery date. Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from discovery, so the fact that the Rhine was part of the Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne cultures does not answer the question. Rule 12 states that irrelevant passages should be ignored. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and since the question is asking for a discovery date, the absence of the word \"not\" implies that the question assumes the Rhine was discovered at some point. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the article.\nThe answer: Cannot be determined.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that \"boundary\" is a different concept from \"areal\" or \"locus.\" Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A forms a boundary with B, then B forms a boundary with A. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation (\"not known to Herodotus\"), which is important for determining the answer.\nThe answer: Germania", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Upper Rhine had been part of the areal of the late Hallstatt culture since the 6th century BC.\nThe answer: since the 6th century BC", "{rule list: 1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Rhine was not known to Herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century BC in Roman-era geography, where it formed the boundary between Gaul and Germania. Therefore, the answer is unknown as there is no specific person mentioned as the first to write about the Rhine's discovery and border.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states \"From the death of Augustus in AD 14...\" which directly answers the question.\nThe answer: AD 14", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70, Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube.\" Therefore, the Rhine and the Danube were accepted as the Germanic frontier during this time period. However, the question specifically asks for the other river besides the Rhine, which is the Danube. \nThe answer: Danube", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell.\" This means that the Rhine stopped being the Roman boundary after the fall of the empire. \nThe answer: after the empire fell", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the direction in which Romans drifted through the Rhine, which implies that they were moving from one side to the other. Rule 3 states that \"direction\" is a different concept from \"size, shape, age, and color,\" and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can infer that the Romans drifted through the Rhine from west to east.\nThe answer: east", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks where the upper Rhine and upper Danube are crossed, which implies that they are bodies of water that can be crossed. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can infer that the upper Rhine and upper Danube are names of rivers. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the rivers are easily crossed, then they are not difficult to cross. \nThe answer: The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: eight legions", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists the assignment of legions for the army of Germania Inferior, and specifies that two legions were stationed at Vetera (Xanten), I Germanica and XX Valeria. Therefore, the two legions were stationed at Vetera (Xanten) for the army of Germania Inferior.\nThe answer: the army of Germania Inferior", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: oppidum Ubiorum", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: whether a state or threat of war existed", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"town of the Ubii\"", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine in the Migration period, which occurred in the 5th century.\nThe answer: 5th century", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Rhine river helped Germanic tribes establish the kingdoms of Francia, Burgundy, and Alemannia.\nThe answer: Kingdoms", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Siebengebirge is a location near Bonn at the Rhine where the hero Siegfried killed a dragon. Therefore, we can use rule 3 to determine that Siebengebirge is a location and rule 12 to ignore the irrelevant information about the Nibelungenlied and the Burgundians. \nThe answer: Seven Mountains (literal translation)", "{rule list: 1, 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the hero who killed a dragon on the Drachenfels. The passage mentions the hero Siegfried and his feat of killing a dragon on the Drachenfels. Therefore, we can use rules 1 (to understand that Siegfried is the hero), 3 (to understand that the dragon is not the hero), 7 (to understand that \"hero\" can be a synonym for \"character\"), and 13 (to understand that names are important for the answer). \nThe answer: Siegfried", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions Kriemhild's golden treasure being thrown into the Rhine by Hagen. According to rule 3, color is a different concept from other concepts, so \"golden\" does not affect the answer. According to rule 16, first comes before last and last comes after first, so Hagen is the one who threw the gold into the Rhine.\nThe answer: Hagen", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"By the 6th century, the Rhine was within the borders of Francia.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that the subject (Rhine) was acted upon the verb (becoming borders with Francia). Therefore, the answer is \"6th century.\" \nThe answer: 6th century", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them is irrelevant to the answer. The passage states that the Rhine was within the borders of Francia by the 6th century, formed part of the border between Middle and Western Francia in the 9th, and was fully within the Holy Roman Empire in the 10th century. Therefore, the answer is the 10th century.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that location is important for the answer (rule 13) is not relevant here, as the question is asking for a specific location mentioned in the article. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" (rule 16) is relevant, as the question is asking for a location mentioned last in the list. \nThe answer: Lower Lorraine.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that Archduke Sigismund of Austria is the first entity mentioned in the sentence and Burgundy is the last. Therefore, the rule 22 applies, which states that \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\". Thus, Archduke Sigismund of Austria sold the Upper Rhine to Burgundy.\nThe answer: Archduke Sigismund of Austria", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469, which is a specific event that happened in the past (rule 16). \"Sold\" is a passive verb, indicating that the subject (Upper Rhine) was acted upon by the object (Burgundy) (rule 24). Therefore, we need to use the antonym of \"sold,\" which is \"bought,\" to determine the answer. Since \"sold\" is a past tense verb, we need to use the past tense of \"bought,\" which is \"was bought\" (rule 2). \nThe answer: 1469", "{rule list: 1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the time period when the Upper Rhine formed a border between France and Germany. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, we can infer that the Upper Rhine formed a border between France and Germany for a long time, since the Peace of Westphalia. Rule 3 tells us that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can't use it to determine the name of the time period. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, we can infer that the time period when the Upper Rhine formed a border between France and Germany is not a time of peace or cooperation between the two countries. \nThe answer: There is no specific name given for the time period, but it was a long-term contentious border between France and Germany since the Peace of Westphalia.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: establishing \"natural borders\" on the Rhine", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon. \nThe answer: Napoleon", "{rule list: 3, 4, 15}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon as a French client state, which implies that it did not exist before his rule. Therefore, we can use rule 15 to assume that the answer is the year in which Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine. Additionally, we can use rules 3 and 4 to understand that the concept of time is different from the concept of nationality and that the answer should be a year. \nThe answer: 1806", "{rule list: 16, 17, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Rhine crisis was prompted by French prime minister Adolphe Thiers's desire to reinstate the Rhine as a natural border, and that it led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in Germany. Therefore, we can infer that the Rhine crisis was a conflict between France and Germany over the border of the Rhine river. The passage does not give a specific date for the Rhine crisis, but it does mention that it occurred in 1840. Therefore, the answer is: 1840.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The article states that at the end of World War I, the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, the answer is \"at the end of World War I.\" \n\nThe answer: at the end of World War I.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the allies left the Rhineland in 1930, which is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: 1930", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is important to understand that the demilitarized zone is not a physical place, but a political concept. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the German army is forbidden to enter Rhineland, it means that they are not allowed to occupy it. \nThe answer: the German army", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 8 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and antonyms. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: Some believe the Treaty of Versailles assisted in helping Adolf Hitler's rise to power.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the German army re-occupied the Rhineland in 1936.\nThe answer: in 1936", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The passage mentions several bridges over the Rhine, but the question specifically asks for the location of \"the Rhine Bridge.\" Rule 3 tells us that location is a different concept from other details mentioned in the passage. Rule 12 tells us that irrelevant information can be ignored. Rule 16 tells us that \"the Rhine Bridge\" refers to a specific bridge, so we can assume that the question is asking for the location of a particular bridge. \nThe answer: The passage mentions several bridges over the Rhine, but does not specify which one is \"the Rhine Bridge.\" Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given information.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Rhine was considered a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies during WWII. Therefore, it can be inferred that the Rhine was considered a difficult obstacle to overcome. \nThe answer: a formidable natural obstacle", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: We can use rule 1 to infer that if the Rhine presented a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, then the Western Allies recognized that the Rhine would be difficult to cross. We can also use rule 16 to infer that Operation Market Garden occurred before the Ludendorff Bridge was captured. \nThe answer: September 1944.", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a bridge that the Germans failed to demolish, indicating a negation. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to the question. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is also not relevant. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant to the question. \nThe answer: Ludendorff Bridge", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Seven Days to the River Rhine", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1,230 kilometres (764 miles)", "{3, 10, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that the German encyclopedia Knaurs Lexikon stated the length of the Rhine as 1,320 kilometers, which was a typographical error. Therefore, the answer is no one stated a change in the length of the Rhine, as the original length of 1,230 kilometers was generally accepted until the error was made. \nThe answer: No one stated a change in the length of the Rhine.", "{1, 2, 7, 10, 11, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions a change in the accepted length of the Rhine. Rule 2 applies because the length was initially accepted as 1,230 km, but later changed to 1,320 km, which is a significant difference. Rule 7 applies because the question asks about a change in measurement, which is related to the concept of length. Rules 10 and 11 apply because contractions and pronouns are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a change, which is a negation of the previous measurement. \nThe answer: It was a typographical error.", "{1, 7, 10}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the previous length of the Rhine was 1,230 km, indicating that the new measurement is more than the previous one. Rule 7 applies because \"measurement\" is a synonym for \"length.\" Rule 10 applies because the contraction \"what's\" is irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: 1,320 kilometres (820 miles)", "{rule list: 1, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses a mistake made in the measurement of the Rhine river, which was corrected in 2010. Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that the correction was made to revert to the original length. Rule 10 applies because typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 applies because some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: It was not corrected back to the original length.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time, which is given in the last sentence of the passage as \"12 May 1999\". Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that \"current\" refers to the most recent parliament, and rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the date comes after the event being described.\nThe answer: 12 May 1999", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the second sentence of the passage, which states that \"the current Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998, which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature.\" Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that \"current\" means the same as \"1998.\" Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the act that set out the Parliament's powers and other concepts mentioned in the passage, such as reserved powers and areas of legislation. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Scotland Act 1998", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. Therefore, the answer is all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that the Scotland Act 1998 explicitly specifies powers that are \"reserved\" to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, indicating that certain powers are not within the Scottish Parliament's legislative competence. The use of the word \"reserved\" is a negation, which is important for the answer. Additionally, the question asks for the body to which these powers are reserved, which is the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a different concept from the Scottish Parliament. \nThe answer: Parliament of the United Kingdom", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. Therefore, the answer is Westminster. \nThe answer: Westminster", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity.\nThe answer: lack of a Parliament of Scotland", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain for \"the next three hundred years\" after a certain event, which is not relevant to the question. This means that the answer is 300 years.\nThe answer: 300", "{rule list: 3, 10, 11, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the reason why suggestions for a devolved parliament before 1914 were shelved. Rules 3, 10, and 11 indicate that irrelevant information should be ignored, including the fact that there was a sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s. Rule 17 indicates that negations are important for the answer. The answer: due to the outbreak of the First World War.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a specific time period when nationalism in Scotland increased. Rule 3 reminds us that time is a different concept from nationality. Rule 7 reminds us that synonyms may be used in the question. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: late 1960s", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a recommendation made by the Kilbrandon Commission in 1973. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that Kilbrandon was a commission is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that the recommendation made by Kilbrandon in 1973 was the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.\nThe answer: a directly elected Scottish Assembly", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the discovery of oil in the North Sea.\nThe answer: North Sea", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: \"It's Scotland's oil\" campaign", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: Prime Minister Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974.\nThe answer: 1974", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1978", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The location of the elected assembly is mentioned in the first sentence of the article and is not a comparison or a profession/nationality/animal/vehicle. The relevant rules are 3 (location is important) and 8 (negations are important). The article states that \"an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh\" if certain conditions were met, but those conditions were not met and the assembly was not established. Therefore, the answer is: Edinburgh (but the assembly was not actually set up).", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the number of the Scottish electorate needed to vote for the elected assembly to be set up in Edinburgh. This is a case of \"if A is X, then B is Y\" where X is \"majority of the Scottish electorate voted for it in a referendum\" and Y is \"the measure is passed.\" Rule 2 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, if the majority of the Scottish electorate voted for the assembly, then the measure would be passed. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. Therefore, if the measure is passed, then the majority of the Scottish electorate voted for it in the referendum. The answer is 40%.", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the vote was 51.6% in favour of a Scottish Assembly,\" but also notes that \"this figure did not equal the 40% of the total electorate threshold deemed necessary to pass the measure.\" Therefore, the answer is not a specific percentage, but rather that the vote was in favor of a Scottish Assembly but did not meet the necessary threshold of 40% of the total electorate. \nThe answer: The vote was in favor of a Scottish Assembly, but did not meet the necessary threshold of 40% of the total electorate.", "{1, 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the referendum failed to meet the required threshold. Rule 2 applies because the vote was somewhat in favor of a Scottish Assembly, but not enough to pass the measure. Rule 8 applies because the measure did not pass due to not meeting the required threshold. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about the outcome of the attempt to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly. \nThe answer: The 1979 Scottish devolution referendum to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly failed. Although the vote was 51.6% in favour of a Scottish Assembly, this figure did not equal the 40% of the total electorate threshold deemed necessary to pass the measure.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the percentage of the voting population that did not vote, which is the same as the percentage of the eligible voting population that did not vote. This is important to note because the article mentions that the measure required at least 40% of the total electorate to vote in order to pass. Therefore, we need to calculate the percentage of eligible voters who did not vote, which is 32.9%. \nThe answer: 32.9%", "{1, 7, 12}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"demand for a Scottish Parliament\" implies that there was more demand in the later years than in the earlier years. Rule 7 applies because \"demand\" is a synonym for \"need\" or \"desire.\" Rule 12 applies because the passage provides background information that is not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: demand for a Scottish Parliament", "{rule list: 1, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the cause of the demand for a Scottish Parliament, which is a comparison between the government of the UK and the political preferences of Scotland. Therefore, rules 1 and 4 are relevant to understanding the political context. Rule 8 is relevant because the question contains the word \"helped,\" indicating a comparison between two factors. \nThe answer: Conservative Party", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the time when the Scottish Constitutional Convention was held, which is an event in the past. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine the order of events and rule 23 to identify the passive voice. \nThe answer: 1989", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the blueprint for devolution provided by the Scottish Constitutional Convention", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Since September 2004, the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh.\" This answer is straightforward and does not require any additional rules beyond Rule 3 (which distinguishes between concepts such as size, shape, age, and color) and Rule 13 (which states that names and locations are equally important for the answer).\nThe answer: The official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh since 2004.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the designer of the Scottish Parliament building. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer should be a person's name rather than their nationality. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the answer should include the name of the designer. \nThe answer: Enric Miralles", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" tells us that the architect's nationality cannot be inferred from his profession. The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" tells us that we need to look for the architect's name in the passage.\nThe answer: Spanish", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The rule that shape is a different concept from size, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles eliminates those as possible answers. The rule that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer means that the misspelling of \"shape\" as \"shap\" does not affect the answer. Therefore, the answer is: leaf-shaped buildings.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The person who opened the new Parliament building on October 9, 2004 is the Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe answer: Queen Elizabeth II", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Parliament's temporary home was the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland, which was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the Church's General Assembly.\nThe answer: the meeting of the Church's General Assembly", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage describes the temporary homes of the Scottish Parliament while the permanent building was being constructed. The first temporary home was the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The answer is the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland.\nThe answer: General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall, which is part of the School of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh, while the Parliament was in its temporary home at the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.\nThe answer: courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall of the School of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the location of the Parliament in May 2002. The passage states that the Parliament was temporarily relocated to the University of Aberdeen in May 2002. Therefore, the answer is the University of Aberdeen.\nThe answer: University of Aberdeen", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article mentions that in May 2000, the Parliament was temporarily relocated, and later mentions that it was relocated to the former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber in Glasgow. This satisfies rules 16 and 22, which state that first comes before last and that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed. \nThe answer: the former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber in Glasgow", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Parliament rented buildings from the City of Edinburgh Council, specifically the former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council and the former Midlothian County Buildings.\nThe answer: City of Edinburgh Council", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP's offices. \"Former\" refers to the Lothian Regional Council building and \"MSP's offices\" is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: Lothian Regional Council building", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that \"former\" refers to the first entity listed and \"latter\" to the last, so we know that the building on George IV Bridge was the first building mentioned. The answer is: it was demolished.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The former Midlothian County Buildings face Parliament Square, High Street, and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh.\nThe answer: Parliament Square, High Street, and George IV Bridge", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the former Midlothian County Buildings housed the Parliament's visitors' center and shop, while the main hall was used as the Parliament's principal committee room. \nThe answer: The main hall of the former Midlothian County Buildings.", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the passage, which states that \"Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer.\" This is a straightforward answer that can be found by applying rules 1 (comparing the roles of different positions) and 4 (distinguishing between profession and nationality). Rule 16 (ordering of events) is also relevant in understanding that the Presiding Officer is elected at the beginning of each parliamentary session. \nThe answer: Tricia Marwick", "{1, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), 13 (names are equally important for the answer), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). The question asks for the current speaker of the Scottish Parliament, and the article states that the current Presiding Officer is Tricia Marwick. Therefore, the answer is Tricia Marwick.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The answer to this question requires knowledge of the type of ballot used to elect the Presiding Officer and deputies. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the fact that the ballot is a secret ballot is a negation of other types of ballots. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question uses the passive voice (\"What type of ballot is used\"), so we need to look for the active voice in the context (\"Parliament elects one MSP\"). Therefore, the answer is: secret ballot.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the article mentions that there are 129 MSPs, which is the total number of members in the Scottish Parliament.\nThe answer: 129", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.\" This indicates that the vote clerk is responsible for operating the equipment and clocks.\nThe answer: The vote clerk.", "{1, 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is asking for the person responsible for ensuring the Parliament functions effectively. Rule 1 applies because \"ensuring the Parliament functions effectively\" is a comparison of effectiveness between different possible responsible parties. Rule 4 applies because \"responsibility\" is a profession, and professions and nationalities are different concepts. Rule 16 applies because \"responsible\" is a characteristic that comes after the subject \"who\" in the sentence. Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"responsible for ensuring the Parliament works smoothly.\" \nThe answer: The Presiding Officer", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The rules of 1 and 4 are relevant because they establish that the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate, as well as convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber. \nThe answer: The Presiding Officer", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it helps us understand that the Presiding Officer is the first member of the Bureau mentioned. Therefore, the answer is: five or more.", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the role of the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. Rule 3 and 4 are relevant to ensure that the concepts of \"role\" and \"nationality\" are not confused. Rule 13 is relevant to identify that the answer is a role or position, rather than a person's name. \nThe answer: The Presiding Officer", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle, with members able to sit anywhere but typically sitting in their party groupings. The First Minister, cabinet ministers, and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side. The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks, and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.\nThe answer: Seating is arranged in a hemicycle, with members sitting in their party groupings and the largest party in the middle of the semicircle.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to encourage consensus amongst elected members", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are 131 seats in the debating chamber, with 129 occupied by elected MSPs and 2 for the Scottish Law Officers.\nThe answer: 131", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that there are 131 seats in the debating chamber, and of those, 2 are reserved for the Scottish Law Officers who are members of the Scottish Government but not elected MSPs. Therefore, the answer is 2.\nThe answer: 2", "{4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Non-elected members from the Scottish Government, specifically the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, can attend and speak in plenary meetings of the Scottish Parliament, but they cannot vote. \nThe answer: vote", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that color is a different concept from other concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if the mace is inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers, then the gold comes from Scotland. \nThe answer: Scottish rivers", "{rule list: 3}\nExplanation: The article states that the parliamentary mace is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers, and is inscribed with the words \"Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity.\" \nThe answer: silver and gold", "{13, 20}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon its official opening in July 1999...\" \nThe answer: The Queen", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"color is a different concept\" is relevant because the answer is not about the color of the mace, but rather the words inscribed on it. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also relevant because the question asks for the words inscribed on the mace, not what is not inscribed on it. \nThe answer: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity.", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes the mace as being presented to the Scottish Parliament and displayed in a glass case suspended from the lid. Therefore, the answer is \"a glass case\".", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that Parliament sits from early January to late June and takes a two-week recess in April. Therefore, April is the first month in the year that Parliament takes a two-week vacation.\nThe answer: April", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that plenary meetings take place in the debating chamber. This is a location and therefore falls under rule 3. The article also specifies that these meetings take place on Wednesday afternoons and Thursdays, which indicates a specific time and order, falling under rule 16.\nThe answer: in the debating chamber", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public.\" This means that debates and meetings are open to anyone who wishes to attend.\nThe answer: the public", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that entry to chamber debates and committee meetings is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space.\nThe answer: free", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Official Report", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The first item of business on Wednesdays is usually Time for Reflection.\" This information directly answers the question.\nThe answer: Wednesdays", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 2 applies because the question mentions \"how long\" and \"might\", indicating a comparison of duration. The rule 16 applies because the article mentions that Time for Reflection is \"up to four minutes\". \nThe answer: up to four minutes", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that invitations to address Parliament for Time for Reflection are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau. Therefore, the answer is the Presiding Officer.\nThe answer: the Presiding Officer", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that the balance being represented is the balance of religious beliefs, not the balance of geographic regions. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"religious beliefs\" can be considered a synonym for \"faith groups.\" \nThe answer: religious beliefs", "{4, 7, 13, 17}\nExplanation: Faith groups can make direct representations to the Presiding Officer to nominate speakers.\nThe answer: Nominate speakers.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that the Presiding Officer decides who speaks in chamber debates and how long they are allowed to speak. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the entity that decides, and \"who\" refers to a person. \nThe answer: The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer)", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The Presiding Officer decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak. This falls under rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Additionally, the Presiding Officer's role in deciding who speaks in debates falls under the concept of profession, which is different from nationality, falling under rule 4. \nThe answer: the amount of time for which members are allowed to speak", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. This involves comparing and balancing the different groups and individuals involved, which is covered by rules 1 and 4. \nThe answer: different viewpoints and political parties", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (4) tells us that \"members\" cannot refer to a profession, so we can eliminate any answer choices that suggest that. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A (8) tells us that if ministers or party leaders typically open debates, then other members are less likely to do so. \nThe answer: ministers or party leaders", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that language is a different concept from other concepts (rule 3) is relevant here, as well as the rule that first comes before last (rule 16) and the rule that negations are important for the answer (rule 17). The answer is Gaelic. \nThe answer: Gaelic", "{rule list: 1, 7}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 1, which states that if A is X than B, then B is less X than A, and rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that \"Each sitting day, normally at 5 pm, MSPs decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day.\" Therefore, the answer is 5 pm.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Decision Time", "{rule list: 1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: MSPs who are not in the chamber return to vote.\nThe answer: Return and vote.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 23}\nExplanation: Members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks. Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (members) is acted upon the verb (vote). \nThe answer: by means of electronic consoles on their desks", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article explains that the outcome of each division is known in seconds, indicating that it is a quick process.\nThe answer: seconds", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If political parties instruct members how to vote, then the outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand. If MSPs who vote against party instructions are unlikely to reach higher political ranks and can be deselected or expelled, then they are less likely to do so, making the outcome more predictable.\nThe answer: the outcome of most votes", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: Political parties normally instruct members how to vote.\nThe answer: political parties", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that the task of ensuring party members vote according to the party line is not related to any specific profession or nationality. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the whips are MSPs. \nThe answer: whips", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Members are typically allowed to vote as they please on moral issues, which is a type of issue that parties may announce as \"free votes\". This is in contrast to most votes, where political parties instruct members which way to vote and MSPs are expected to vote according to the party line, with the risk of being deselected or expelled if they do not comply. Rule 4 applies to distinguish between profession and issue, while rule 17 applies to consider the negation in the question. \nThe answer: moral issues", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If a member doesn't vote the party line, they are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties and can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright.\nThe answer: They are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties and can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright.", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The article states that the Members Debate is held \"immediately after Decision Time.\" This indicates that it is held right after a certain event, which is the Decision Time. The question asks for a specific time, which is provided by the context as \"immediately after Decision Time.\"\nThe answer: Immediately after Decision Time", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a Scottish minister. This is because the motion may be on issues that are of interest to a particular area or constituency and would not be accorded official parliamentary time otherwise. \nThe answer: to discuss issues of interest to a particular area or constituency.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 1 because it compares the length of the Members Debate to the length of Decision Time, which is not mentioned in the question. Rule 8 also applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"45 minutes\" is more than \"0 minutes\" (which is the length of Decision Time), so \"0 minutes\" is less than \"45 minutes\". \nThe answer: 45 minutes", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Members other than the proposer contribute to the debate.\nThe answer: other members", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant minister \"winds up\" the debate by speaking after all other participants.\nThe answer: \"winds up\" the debate", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee.\" This sentence directly answers the question.\nThe answer: in committee", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the comparison between committees in the Scottish Parliament and other parliamentary systems is not a matter of size, shape, age, or color. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, then committees in other parliamentary systems are weaker than in the Scottish Parliament. \nThe answer: stronger", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the lack of a revising chamber", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for what committees do, not what they don't do. The answer is \"take evidence from witnesses\".", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.\" This indicates that committees may meet outside of Parliament, as long as it is in Scotland.\nThe answer: other locations throughout Scotland.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that committees are comprised of a small number of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament.\nThe answer: MSPs", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the membership of the committees reflects the balance of parties across Parliament, meaning that if one party has more MSPs, they will have more members on the committees. Rule 4 applies because profession and political affiliation are different concepts, and the question is asking about the political affiliation of the committee members. \nThe answer: the balance of parties across Parliament", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that there are different committees with their functions set out in different ways. This means that the set up or structure of the committees varies. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that the structure of the committees is a different concept from their functions. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means that \"set up\" and \"structure\" can be considered synonyms in this context.\nThe answer: The set up/structure of the committees.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article explains that there are different types of committees in the Scottish Parliament, and one of them is Mandatory Committees, which are set down under the Scottish Parliament's standing orders. This means that the type of committee set down under the SP's standing orders is a Mandatory Committee.\nThe answer: Mandatory Committee", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article mentions \"the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament\"\nThe answer: the fourth Session", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Subject Committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session.\" This indicates that subject committees are established at the start of each new session.\nThe answer: at the beginning of each parliamentary session", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: One (or more)", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists the current Subject Committees in the fourth Session, and Economy, Energy and Tourism is one of them.\nThe answer: Subject Committees", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" tells us that the fourth session is the current session. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" tells us that \"the Scottish Parliament\" is the subject and \"the fourth Session\" is the object of the preposition \"in\". \nThe answer: the fourth Session", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that a committee is set up to scrutinize private bills submitted by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. This falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph.\nThe answer: A committee.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Private bills typically relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property, and are submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government.\nThe answer: large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament relate to large-scale development projects that require the use of land or property. However, it does not mention who specifically decides how land or property is allowed to be used. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are the most relevant, as they remind us that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different from professions and nationalities. The answer cannot be inferred from the given information.\nThe answer: Cannot be determined.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Private Bill Committees are set up to scrutinize private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter. The Edinburgh Tram Network is a large-scale development project that requires the use of land or property, and therefore falls under the category of private bills. Therefore, a Private Bill Committee would have considered legislation on the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network.\nThe answer: Private Bill Committee", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the act that sets forth the functions of the Scottish Parliament. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that the Scotland Act 1998 is the act that sets forth the functions of the Scottish Parliament. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of profession and nationality, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 13 is relevant because it establishes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Scotland Act 1998.", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the person who gave royal assent to the Scotland Act of 1998. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for the name of the person who gave royal assent. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we need to look for the name of the monarch who was reigning at the time. \nThe answer: Queen Elizabeth II", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The Scotland Act 2012 extends the devolved competencies. This means that the Act expands the areas of Scottish domestic policy that are under the control of the Scottish Parliament. The Act does not change the fact that the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster remains the supreme legislature of Scotland. \nThe answer: devolved competencies", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which is also not relevant to this question. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is relevant because the question is asking for the body that constitutes the supreme legislature of Scotland. The answer is the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster. \nThe answer: Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament, including its power to hold the Scottish Government to account. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including the role of holding the government to account and other functions of the Parliament. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that the answer to the question is the last piece of information provided in the passage. \nThe answer: The Scottish Parliament", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The Scotland Act explicitly states reserved matters in Schedule 5.\nThe answer: Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act", "3, 4, 5, 6, 17\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 states that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 5 states that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 6 states that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that \"negations are important for the answer\" and therefore relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: The Scottish Parliament.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Scots law \u2013 courts, police and fire services\" are devolved matters, meaning they are under the control of the Scottish Parliament. This falls under rule 3, which states that different concepts such as \"size, shape, age, and color\" are not interchangeable, and rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts. The answer is that police and fire services are devolved to the Scottish Parliament because they are considered part of Scots law.", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is rule 2, which states that if A can alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound, then B can alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound more or less than A. Additionally, rule 8 applies, which states that if A can alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound more than B, then B can alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound less than A. \nThe answer: up to 3 pence in the pound.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2012 Act", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: These rules help to identify that \"reserved matters\" are a distinct concept from other matters that the Scottish Parliament can legislate on, and that negations in the question are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Reserved matters", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question is asking for the opposite of issues that are dealt with at Westminster, which means the answer should be issues that are not able to be dealt with by the Scottish Parliament. Therefore, the answer is \"issues dealt with at Westminster are not ones the Scottish Parliament is able to deal with.\"", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate on reserved matters, which include issues like abortion and drug policy. These matters are reserved to, and dealt with at, Westminster (and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers).\nThe answer: Westminster.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is irrelevant to the answer. The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is also irrelevant to the answer. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that \"transport safety\" is dealt with by Westminster. \nThe answer: Westminster.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: The article mentions that bills can be introduced to Parliament in various ways, including by the Scottish Government, a committee of the Parliament, a member of the Scottish Parliament, or an outside proposer. This falls under rule 1, which states that if A can be done in various ways, then the ways in which B can be done are also various. It also falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, as the different ways of introducing bills are associated with different entities (government, committee, member, outside proposer). \nThe answer: bills", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill.\" It also mentions that \"a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member.\" These rules apply because they specify that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: The Scottish Government or a member of the Scottish Parliament.", "{4, 8, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A), and 13 (names are equally important for the answer). The question asks for the term used when an MSP introduces a bill, which is \"private member\" bill. \"Private member\" is a term used in the context to refer to a member of the Scottish Parliament who introduces a bill.", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: Private bills can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer.\nThe answer: an outside proposer", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Bills pass through Parliament in stages.\nThe answer: Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages.", "{1, 3, 4, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Stage 1 is the first, or introductory stage of the bill, where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to Parliament together with its accompanying documents \u2013 Explanatory Notes, a Policy Memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill, and a Financial Memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it. Statements from the Presiding Officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament. Stage 1 usually takes place, initially, in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole Parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill. If the whole Parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill, it then proceeds to Stage 2. \nThe answer: The first, or introductory stage of the bill.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The Explanatory Notes, a Policy Memorandum, and a Financial Memorandum are presented to Parliament in addition to the bill itself.\nThe answer: Explanatory Notes, a Policy Memorandum, and a Financial Memorandum", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Statements from the Presiding Officer and the member in charge of the bill indicate whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament.\nThe answer: whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Bills are typically gestated in the relevant committee or committees during Stage 1.\nThe answer: relevant committee or committees", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about what happens after Parliament agrees to the general principle of a bill, which is a comparison between two stages. Rule 16 applies because the article describes the stages of a bill in chronological order, and the question asks about what happens next. \nThe answer: Stage 2.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The final stage of a bill in the Scottish Parliament is Stage 3, which is considered at a meeting of the whole Parliament. This stage comprises two parts: consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate, and a final vote on the bill. Opposition members can table \"wrecking amendments\" to the bill, designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time, to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken. After a general debate on the final form of the bill, members proceed to vote at Decision Time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill.\nThe answer: Stage 3", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Stage 3 of the bill comprises two parts: consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate, and a final vote on the bill.\nThe answer: two parts", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: In Stage 3, there is a final vote on the bill. Negations are important for the answer because the question asks specifically about the vote that takes place in Stage 3. \nThe answer: final vote on the bill", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If members are opposed to a bill, they may table \"wrecking amendments\" to the bill, designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time, to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken. These amendments are intended to have the opposite effect of the bill's intended purpose, hence they are \"antonyms\" of the bill. \nThe answer: Wrecking amendments.", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that members proceed to vote at Decision Time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill. Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that \"final stage\" means the last stage of the bill, and Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"last\" comes after all other stages. \nThe answer: at Decision Time", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about the recipient of the final bill, which is the opposite perspective of the article's statement about who submits the bill. Rule 16 applies because the question asks about the final step in the process, which is mentioned last in the article. Rule 23 applies because the question asks about the passive action of submitting the bill, which is mentioned in the article. \nThe answer: the Monarch", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article explains that after a bill is passed by the Scottish Parliament, it is submitted to the Monarch for royal assent, which is a necessary step for it to become an Act of the Scottish Parliament. This is a traditional process in the UK's constitutional monarchy system, where the Monarch serves as a symbolic head of state with certain ceremonial and legal duties, including giving royal assent to bills passed by Parliament. Therefore, rule 3 (clarifying that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 4 (clarifying that profession and nationality are different concepts) are the most relevant for this question. \nThe answer: The Monarch gives royal assent as part of the traditional process in the UK's constitutional monarchy system.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for the minimum amount of time before a bill can go into law. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is relevant because the question is asking for the minimum amount of time, which is the opposite of the 4-week period mentioned in the passage. Therefore, the answer is: there is a 4-week period that must elapse before a bill can go into law.", "{1, 3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about a referral for a ruling, which implies a comparison of the bill's powers to those of the Parliament. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about a concept (powers) rather than a physical attribute. Rule 16 applies because the question asks about a process that occurs after the bill has been passed. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a negation (whether the bill is not within the powers of the Parliament). \nThe answer: The Law Officers of the Scottish Government or UK Government can refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that Acts of the Scottish Parliament do not begin with a conventional enacting formula, but instead begin with a specific phrase that includes the date the bill was passed and the date it received royal assent. This is a specific detail about the format of bills passed by the Scottish Parliament, which falls under the rule about the order of information in a sentence (rule 16) and the rule that different concepts, such as format and content, should not be confused (rule 3).\nThe answer: The template for bills passed by the Scottish Parliament includes a specific phrase that includes the date the bill was passed and the date it received royal assent.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The Scottish Parliament is formed by the party or parties that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament. The leader of the largest party is normally returned as First Minister and head of the Scottish Government.\nThe answer: The party or parties that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: any member of Parliament", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The First Minister is elected at the beginning of each parliamentary term.\nThe answer: The First Minister", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that ministers are drawn from a specific nationality. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that ministers are drawn from a specific type of entity. Therefore, the answer is \"elected MSPs\". \nThe answer: elected MSPs", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: In an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question asks for who makes the formal appointment or dismissal decisions, which is a passive construction. Therefore, we need to use rule 23. Additionally, we need to use rule 16 to understand that the Sovereign is the one who makes the formal appointment or dismissal decisions, even though the First Minister chooses and may decide to remove ministers. \nThe answer: the Sovereign", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the timing of the elections and a specific day of the week. Rule 3 applies because the question is asking about the day of the week, which is a different concept than the timing of the elections. \nThe answer: Thursday", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two entities based on a comparative adjective. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts. \nThe answer: May", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as time and authority are different, so we know that the question is asking about who has the authority to change the date of the election. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the Presiding Officer (PO) must be mentioned before the Monarch. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we know that the Monarch is the one who acts upon the proposal of the PO. \nThe answer: The Monarch", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, rule 3 states that \"profession and nationality are different concepts,\" which is relevant because the question is asking about the relationship between an extraordinary election and an ordinary election. The answer is that if an extraordinary election is held within less than six months before the date of an ordinary election, it supplants the ordinary election.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The Parliament has 28 days to nominate a First Minister after a General Election.\nThe answer: 28 days", "{1, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage describes several procedures that allow the Scottish Parliament to scrutinize the government, including the delivery of statements by the First Minister or members of the cabinet, followed by questioning by MSPs. The answer is the procedures described in the passage. \nThe answer: Several procedures, including the delivery of statements and questioning by MSPs, enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinize the government.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: MSPs (Members of the Scottish Parliament)", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year.\nThe answer: a statement on the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: issues related to the substance of the statement", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that size and shape are different concepts is irrelevant, as neither is mentioned in the article. The relevant rule is that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. The article states that parliamentary time is \"set aside for question periods in the debating chamber,\" so the answer is \"question periods.\" \nThe answer: question periods", "{1, 7}\nExplanation: The first rule applies because the question asks for a specific day, and the passage provides information about the day and time of the General Question Time. The seventh rule applies because \"General Question Time\" may have synonyms or alternative phrasings, but the answer must refer to the same event mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: Thursday", "{1, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if someone is able to direct questions towards any member of the Scottish Government during General Question Time, then it follows that any member of the Scottish Government can be the recipient of those questions. Rule 7 applies because the question uses the word \"members\" which is a synonym for \"politicians\" or \"lawmakers\" in this context. Rule 13 applies because the question asks about who the members can direct questions towards, which is a reference to the individuals who hold a specific position or role in the Scottish Government. \n\nThe answer: Any member of the Scottish Government.", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so it is important to identify \"First Minister's Question Time\" as the relevant period for questioning the First Minister. Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the information about other question periods can be ignored. First comes before last and last comes after first, so it is important to identify \"First Minister's Question Time\" as the first question period mentioned. Negations are important for the answer, so it is important to note that members can question the First Minister directly during First Minister's Question Time. \nThe answer: Members may question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction during First Minister's Question Time.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a number, which is a quantitative concept. Therefore, rule 3 applies, which states that size is a different concept from profession or nationality. Rule 8 also applies, as the question is asking for the number of questions available to opposition leaders, which is a comparison of quantity. \nThe answer: four", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as 'Constituency MSPs'.\" This means that the number of Constituency MSPs is 73, which is the most. \nThe answer: 73", "{rule list: 16, 17, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that the Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs. This means that there was a reduction in the number of Scottish MPs in 2005.\nThe answer: 2005", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The article states that voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with the most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. This means that voters can only choose one member to represent the constituency.\nThe answer: one", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that size and shape are different concepts applies here, as the smaller number of electors in the island archipelagos is due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, not their physical size or shape. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A applies, as the question asks why the island archipelagos comprise a smaller number of electors, implying that they have fewer electors than other areas. \nThe answer: Due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors.\" This means that the current number of electors in a Scottish Parliament constituency is 55,000.\nThe answer: 55,000", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: The seats are allocated proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method, which follows a formula that divides the number of list votes cast for each party by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region. The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, and this process is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated. \nThe answer: proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the method used for tallying votes in the second vote of the ballot. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What method is not used for tallying votes in the second vote of the ballot?\" The answer is then \"first-past-the-post\" or any other method that is not the d'Hondt method. \n\nThe answer: d'Hondt method", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: The d'Hondt method allocates seats proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot. To determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region. The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat. Therefore, the party awarded a seat is the one with the highest quotient. \nThe answer: quotient", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the constituency seats are allocated first, and then the list seats are added to them. \nThe answer: constituency seats", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The process is repeated iteratively.", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: Being an MSP shares qualifications with the House of Commons, as introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981. Specifically, members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK.", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the act that introduced qualifications for being an MSP and then finding the year in which the British Nationality Act was passed. Rule 16 helps to identify the relevant sentence in the article, while rule 17 reminds us that negations in the question are important for the answer. \nThe answer: 1981", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a comparison between the age requirement for being an MSP and other qualifications. Rule 3 applies because age is a different concept from nationality or profession. \nThe answer: over the age of 18", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, members of the police and armed forces, as well as civil servants and members of foreign legislatures, are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs. \nThe answer: police, armed forces, civil servants, foreign legislatures", "{rule list: 23, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the act that sets the term for judging the boundaries of sanity for individuals wishing to sit on the Scottish Parliament. This requires understanding that the sentence refers to the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, which sets the criteria for determining whether an individual is judged to be insane. The relevant rules are 23 (passive voice) and 17 (negations). \nThe answer: Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer involves a comparison between the current situation and past situations, which requires the application of rule 1. The question also involves political parties and their roles, which falls under rule 4. Finally, the question asks about a specific occurrence, which requires the use of rule 16. \nThe answer: the first time in the Scottish Parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority.", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A takes X from B, then B loses X to A), 3 (names are equally important for the answer), and 13 (names are equally important for the answer). The answer: Labour.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Labour leader Iain Gray retained East Lothian by 151 votes.\"\nThe answer: 151 votes", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: We use rule 3 to determine that \"seats\" and \"majority\" are different concepts. We use rule 16 to determine that \"further\" refers to a number greater than zero. \nThe answer: 8", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The result of the SNP majority allowed a referendum on Scottish independence to be held.\nThe answer: Scottish independence", "{rule list: 1, 16, 22}\nExplanation: The rule of \"if two entities are listed, then 'former' refers to the first and 'latter' to the last\" helps us identify that David McLetchie was the former party leader. The rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the loss of Edinburgh Pentlands was the main disappointment for the Conservatives. The answer is: the Conservatives.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Edinburgh Pentlands was the seat of former party leader David McLetchie.\nThe answer: Edinburgh Pentlands", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Conservatives suffered a net loss of five seats.\nThe answer: 5", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the person who announced their resignation as leader of the Conservatives. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Annabel Goldie is the leader of the party mentioned in the passage. Rule 23 tells us that passive voice is important, so we need to look for a sentence where someone is announcing their own resignation. The sentence \"Nevertheless, she too announced she would step down as leader of the party\" fits this criteria. \nThe answer: Annabel Goldie", "{16, 18}\nExplanation: We need to identify who congratulated the SNP while vowing to campaign against their referendum. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that Annabel Goldie is the leader of the Conservatives mentioned first, and Cameron is mentioned last. Rule 18 tells us that negations in the question are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks who congratulated the SNP while vowing to campaign against their referendum. Therefore, the answer is Cameron.", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between Scottish MPs and MPs from other parts of the UK in terms of their ability to vote on domestic legislation. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between the profession of being an MP and the nationality of being Scottish or from another part of the UK. \nThe answer: Scottish MPs are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: MPs from England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are unable to vote on domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament. \nThe answer: domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament", "{3, 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The rules of 3 and 4 state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that negations are important for the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Rule 17 states that negations in the question are important for the answer. The answer is: The West Lothian question.", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the specific election mentioned in the article. Rule 16 helps to determine that the 2015 UK election is the most recent one mentioned. Rule 18 reminds us to pay attention to negations in the question, as the question asks for the party that had a victory, not a defeat. \nThe answer: Conservative", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer, and rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: England", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: The article describes Islamism as an Islamic revival movement, which means it is a movement that seeks to revive or renew Islamic values and practices. Rule 1 applies because \"revival\" implies a comparison to a previous state of being. Rule 3 applies because \"revival\" refers to a concept, not a physical attribute like size or shape. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the definition of a term, and the negation \"not\" is important to the answer.\nThe answer: a movement that seeks to revive or renew Islamic values and practices", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that Islamism seeks \"to implement Islamic values in all spheres of life.\" This means that it seeks to integrate itself into all aspects of life.\nThe answer: all spheres of life", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that Islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the Shari'a, which implies that they want to change the current state of government and society. Additionally, the use of the word \"reordering\" suggests that they want to change the current structure of society and government, rather than simply maintain it. \nThe answer: to reorder government and society in accordance with the Shari'a", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: The two different Islamist movements have been described as oscillating between a strategy of Islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion, and a \"reformist\" pole where Islamists work to Islamize society gradually \"from the bottom up\". This is a comparison of two different approaches, so rule 2 applies. Additionally, the question uses the word \"described\", which implies a comparison, so rule 8 also applies.\nThe answer: The two different Islamist movements have been described as oscillating between a strategy of Islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion, and a \"reformist\" pole where Islamists work to Islamize society gradually \"from the bottom up\".", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a method of Islamization that involves seizing power. Rule 1 tells us that if A is a strategy of Islamization that involves seizing power, then the answer to the question is that the method of Islamization is to seize power. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the \"reformist\" pole is the opposite of the strategy of seizing power, so we can use rule 8 to clarify that the answer is to seize power. \nThe answer: Seize power.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: democratic process", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Palestine", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to abolish the state of Israel", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Radical Islamist organizations entirely reject democracy.\nThe answer: democracy", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that radical Islamist organizations like al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad entirely reject democracy and often declare as kuffar those Muslims who support it. Therefore, they conduct their attacks on a religious basis.\nThe answer: on a religious basis", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a major division", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: \"Underwent a remarkable shift\" implies a change in direction or focus, which is a comparison between two different time periods. The use of \"rather than\" indicates a contrast between two opposing ideas. The word \"rejection\" is a negation. \nThe answer: Sunni pan-Islamism's focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement's emphasis on sharia and rejection of Shia Islam.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article compares the Salafi movement to the Muslim Brotherhood and describes the former as emphasizing \"sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions.\" Rule 3 applies because the emphasis on sharia is a different concept than the building of Islamic institutions. \nThe answer: sharia", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses how Islamism has become increasingly interdependent with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world following the Arab Spring. This means that Islamism and democracy are now dependent on each other. The use of \"increasingly interdependent\" implies a growing relationship between the two concepts. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: democracy", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy.", "{1, 2, 3, 4}\nExplanation: The concept of Islamism is controversial because it posits a political role for Islam, which some believe is an error as they see Islam as apolitical. This disagreement over the role of Islam in politics creates controversy. \nThe answer: political role", "{rule list: 2, 7}\nExplanation: Supporters of Islamism believe their views merely reflect Islam.\nThe answer: Islam", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as religion and politics are different, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for the opposite of the idea that Islam can be apolitical, which means that the answer is someone who does not believe that Islam is apolitical. Therefore, the answer is not able to be embraced by scholars and observers who do not believe that Islam is merely a political ideology, such as Fred Halliday, John Esposito, and Muslim intellectuals like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi. \nThe answer: Fred Halliday, John Esposito, and Muslim intellectuals like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: illiberal Islamic regimes", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"religion and politics are different concepts\" (rule 3) is relevant because the question asks about what progressive moderates seek to separate, implying that there is a connection between religion and politics that they want to break. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" (rule 17) is also relevant because the question asks about what progressive moderates want to separate, implying that there are other groups who do not want to separate religion and politics. \nThe answer: religion from politics", "{1, 2, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparative language, which is used in the question. Rule 7 is relevant because the question asks for a specific term used by Islamists. Rule 17 is relevant because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: Islamists believe they should be referred to as Muslims who believe in Islamism, not just Islam.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The writer for the International Crisis Group believes that the conception of \"political Islam\" is a creation of Americans.\nThe answer: Americans", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that apolitical Islam cannot be defined by any of these characteristics. The rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which means that we need to look for the opposite of political Islam. Therefore, the answer is quietist/non-political Islam. \nThe answer: quietist/non-political Islam", "{rule list: 3, 7, 10, 12, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period related to secular Arab nationalism. Rules 3 and 7 remind us that age and concepts are different, and that synonyms may be used in the question. Rule 10 tells us that typos in the question are irrelevant. Rule 12 reminds us that some passages in the context may be irrelevant. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important. \nThe answer: between 1945 and 1970", "{rule list: 3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The article distinguishes between \"quietist/non-political Islam\" and \"Islamism\", with the former being described as a historical fluke that requires explanation. The negation in the question (\"rather than Islamism\") is also important to note.\nThe answer: quietist/non-political Islam", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: dangerous enemies", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Western and pro-Western governments supported fledgling Islamists during the 1970s and sometimes later, as they were considered bulwarks against leftist/communist/nationalist insurgents/opposition.", "{rule list: 1, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that applies here is rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the non-Afghan veterans returning home had \"experience, ideology, and weapons\", which implies that they had more than just prestige. Therefore, the answer is \"experience, ideology, and weapons\".\n", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify who the US provided aid to, which is the opposite of who they were fighting against (Soviet Union). The answer is also a negation, so we need to consider rule 17. We also need to differentiate between concepts of nationality and ideology, so rules 3 and 4 apply. \nThe answer: mujahideen Muslim Afghanistan enemies of the Soviet Union", "{1, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule of antonyms applies here, as the question asks for the group that was considered lesser in comparison to another group. Rule 4 also applies, as profession and ideology are different concepts. Rule 8 applies, as the question asks for a comparison between two groups. \nThe answer: leftist/communist/nationalist insurgents/opposition", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for what the non-Afghan veterans returning home had in addition to their prestige. The passage states that they returned with their \"experience, ideology, and weapons\". \nThe answer: experience, ideology, and weapons", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the President of Egypt, which is a person and therefore falls under rule 13. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the article mentions Anwar Sadat's policies and actions does not make him any less the President of Egypt. \nThe answer: Anwar Sadat", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Sadat made peace with Israel\nThe answer: making peace", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: political support in his struggle against leftists", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when the gentlemen's agreement broke down, which is a specific event in the past. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negative statement about the agreement. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to look for a sentence where the agreement is the object of the verb. The sentence \"This 'gentlemen's agreement' between Sadat and Islamists broke down in 1975\" satisfies both rules and provides the answer.\nThe answer: 1975", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 17, 19, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks about how Sadat was rewarded by the Islamists for his policies. Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons, and the question is asking about a reward in exchange for political support. Rule 3 is relevant because it clarifies that concepts like modernization and civilization are different from rewards. Rule 4 is relevant because it clarifies that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question is not asking about Sadat's nationality. Rule 5 is relevant because it clarifies that animals and vehicles are different concepts, and the question is not asking about any physical rewards. Rule 7 is relevant because it clarifies that questions may contain synonyms, and the question uses the word \"rewarded\" instead of \"supported.\" Rule 8 is relevant because it clarifies that comparisons have antonyms, and the question is asking about a positive reward. Rules 10 and 20 are relevant because they clarify that contractions and gender are irrelevant to the answer. Rule ", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including interpretations of Islam. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including interpretations of Islam. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms in the question. \nThe answer: Wahhabism or Salafism", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and antonyms. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality. Rule 7 is relevant because it deals with synonyms. Rule 8 is relevant because it deals with antonyms. Rule 17 is relevant because it deals with negations. \nThe answer: hate them for their religion", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the impact of democracy to other events. Rule 3 applies because \"horrible events\" is a different concept from democracy. Rule 8 applies because it compares the impact of democracy to other events. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negation. \nThe answer: all the horrible wars of the 20th century", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims are classified as infidels in the conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism interpretation of Islam. This is in contrast to more moderate local interpretations. \nThe answer: infidels", "{rule list: 2, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the interpretation of Islam that is considered the \"gold standard\" by some or many Muslims. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the phrase \"gold standard,\" which implies a comparison of different interpretations. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the interpretation that is considered the standard, which implies a comparison of different interpretations. Rule 17 applies because the passage includes a negation (\"by no means converted all, or even most Muslims\"), which is important for understanding the scope of the answer.\nThe answer: the Saudi-interpretation of Islam", "{4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood is a movement does not give us information about their nationality. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"type of movement\" can be understood as \"kind of movement\". Finally, the rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the name \"Muslim Brotherhood\". \nThe answer: Islamist movement", "1, 3, 4, 7, 17\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a comparison between the Muslim Brotherhood and a certain type of local government. Rules 1 and 3 help to clarify that the comparison is based on competence or effectiveness. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we should not assume that the comparison is based on the government's religious affiliation. Rule 7 reminds us to look for synonyms or related concepts in the question, such as \"competence\" and \"inefficient.\" Finally, Rule 17 reminds us to pay attention to negations, as the question asks for a comparison to \"incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful\" governments. \nThe answer: governments that are incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of nationality-based assistance. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of physical assistance. Therefore, the only relevant concept left is education, which falls under the category of \"different concepts.\" \nThe answer: housing assistance", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Incompetent government's commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric, which is a negation. Rule 3 states that negations are important for the answer, and rule 17 states that negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: rhetoric", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Muslim Brotherhood facilitates inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands. This is an example of the organization providing housing assistance to students from out of town, as well as an effort to promote social justice by making marriage more accessible to those who may not be able to afford it otherwise.\nThe answer: to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands", "{rule list: 3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Iqbal was studying law and philosophy in England and Germany.\nThe answer: law and philosophy", "{rule list: 4, 16, 20, 21}\nExplanation: Iqbal became a member of the All India Muslim League in London.\nThe answer: All India Muslim League", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a nationality. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negative statement. The passage states that Iqbal was \"a critic of the mainstream Indian nationalist and secularist Indian National Congress,\" so the answer is the Indian National Congress. \nThe answer: Indian National Congress", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1908", "{13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Iqbal's seven English lectures were published by Oxford University press in 1934. \nThe answer: The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society.\" The use of the word \"fears\" indicates a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: secularism and secular nationalism", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can ignore them. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if Iqbal expressed fears that secularism and secular nationalism would weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, then he worried that India's mostly Hindu population would strengthen the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society. Finally, the rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we can conclude that Iqbal worried that India's mostly Hindu population would not preserve Muslim heritage, culture, and political influence. \nThe answer: Iqbal worried that India's mostly Hindu population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture, and political influence.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Iqbal expressed fears that secularism and secular nationalism would weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, and that India's Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture, and political influence. He promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences. Therefore, when he encouraged ending nationalist differences, he was advocating for greater Islamic political unity. \nThe answer: nationalist differences", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the information about Iqbal being elected president of the Muslim League comes after the information about his travels to various countries. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence \"Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League\" is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: 1930", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the Pakistan movement", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi", "{rule list: 4, 15}\nExplanation: Maududi was trained as a lawyer but chose the profession of journalism for himself.\nThe answer: journalism", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that the founding of the Jamaat-e-Islami party comes after Maududi's training as a lawyer and profession of journalism. We use rule 23 to understand that the sentence \"Maududi founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941\" is an active sentence, meaning that Maududi is the subject and the act of founding the party is the verb. \nThe answer: 1941", "{3, 4, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organizing, and that his influential books placed Islam in a modern context and influenced not only conservative ulema but also liberal modernizer Islamists. Therefore, the most relevant rules are that profession and nationality are different concepts (4), names are equally important for the answer (13), and some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer (12). Additionally, since the question asks for where Maududi exerted the most impact, the rule that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts (3) is also relevant. \nThe answer: through his writing", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Maududi's books placed Islam in a modern context, which implies that they presented Islam as relevant and applicable to contemporary issues. This is in contrast to traditional or outdated views of Islam. Additionally, the question uses the word \"place\" which can be interpreted as \"present\" or \"portray\". Therefore, rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B) are relevant.\nThe answer: in a modern context", "{rule list: 4, 13, 19}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts (4) helps us identify that Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi was a figure in the Islamic revival in India, not a nationality. The rule that names are equally important for the answer (13) confirms that Maududi is the correct answer. The rule that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession (19) ensures that we do not eliminate Maududi as a possibility based on gender. \nThe answer: Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: Maududi was trained as a lawyer but chose the profession of journalism instead.\nThe answer: journalism", "{3, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organizing, indicating that his impact was through his written works. This is supported by rule 3, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 5, which states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, indicating that impact and political organizing are different concepts. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the answer is: through his writing.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to the question. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" is not relevant either, as there are no synonyms in the question. However, the rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant, as the question asks where Maududi's books placed Islam, implying a positive impact. Therefore, the answer is that Maududi's books placed Islam in a modern context. \nThe answer: in a modern context", "{rule list: 1, 4}\nExplanation: Maududi believed that Muslim society could not be Islamic without Sharia, which is a set of Islamic laws and principles. This falls under rule 1, which states that if A is X, then B is less X than A. Additionally, Sharia is a concept related to religion, not nationality or profession, so rule 4 applies. \nThe answer: Sharia", "{1, 3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"without Sharia\" implies that Sharia is necessary for Islam. Rule 3 applies because \"Muslim society\" and \"Islamic state\" are different concepts. Rule 4 applies because \"Islamic state\" and \"theo-democracy\" are different concepts. \nThe answer: an Islamic state", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Therefore, tawhid, which is a concept, cannot be translated as a size, shape, age, or color. The rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. Therefore, we can look for a synonym of tawhid in the paragraph and translate it into English.\nThe answer: unity of God", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Gradual changing of hearts and minds through an educational process or da'wah.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: Maududi wanted to change the hearts and minds of individuals through an educational process or da'wah, which is a non-violent method. Negations are important for the answer because the question asks for the method of change, not the method of revolution. \nThe answer: through an educational process or da'wah.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time, which can be answered by identifying the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood.\nThe answer: 1928", "{rule list: 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the location where the Muslim Brotherhood was founded. Rule 4 is relevant to ensure that \"founding\" refers to the establishment of an organization rather than a physical location. Rule 7 is relevant to identify \"Muslim Brotherhood\" as the organization in question. Rule 13 is relevant to identify \"Ismailiyah\" as the location where the organization was founded.\nThe answer: Ismailiyah, Egypt", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the person who founded the Muslim Brotherhood.\nThe answer: Hassan al Banna", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The motto of the Muslim Brotherhood is \"the Qur'an is our constitution,\" which means that they believe in governing based on Islamic principles as outlined in the Qur'an.\nThe answer: The Qur'an", "{rule list: 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Al Banna wished to eliminate all imperialist influence in the Muslim world.\nThe answer: imperialist influence", "{rule list: 1, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks about elements that engaged in violence, implying that there were also elements that did not. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"against,\" indicating a negation. \nThe answer: violence", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: Al-Banna was assassinated in 1949, as stated in the passage.\nThe answer: 1949", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Egypt's premier Mahmud Fami Naqrashi", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The Brotherhood has been banned several times, but the question asks for the first time. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can ignore the later bans. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that the Brotherhood engages in violence against the government. \nThe answer: 1948", "{rule list: 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"following confrontations with Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser, who jailed thousands of members for several years.\" Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so \"Egyptian president\" refers to the president of Egypt. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so \"Gamal Abdul Nasser\" is the name of the president. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer is \"Gamal Abdul Nasser\" who jailed thousands of members of the Brotherhood. \nThe answer: Gamal Abdul Nasser", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) is relevant because the question asks about the status of the Brotherhood in the Islamic world, which is a matter of influence and not nationality. The rule that \"negations in the question are important for the answer\" (8) is relevant because the question asks about the status that the Brotherhood has obtained, implying that it has achieved a certain level of influence. \nThe answer: The Brotherhood has become one of the most influential movements in the Islamic world.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific percentage, which is a numerical value. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so we can focus on the numerical value rather than any descriptive words. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can determine that the political parties identified as \"Islamist\" won 75% of the total seats in the Egyptian parliamentary election of 2011-2012.\nThe answer: 75%", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"For many years it was described as 'semi-legal'\". This fits with rule 3, which states that age and profession are different concepts, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"semi-legal\" is the opposite of \"legal\", so the Brotherhood was less legal than other groups. \nThe answer: semi-legal", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the Brotherhood was the only opposition group able to field candidates during elections, making them more influential than other opposition groups. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" applies because the question asks about the Brotherhood's ability to do something during elections, not their nationality. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" applies because the question asks about the only opposition group able to do something, implying that other opposition groups were not able to do it. \nThe answer: field candidates during elections", "{rule list: 4, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which is in the passive voice. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that Mohamed Morsi is described as an \"Islamist democrat.\" \nThe answer: Mohamed Morsi", "{rule list: 1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the description of the defeat of the Arab troops during the Six-Day War. Rule 1 applies because it compares the strength of the two sides. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between different concepts, such as the Arab and Israeli troops. Rule 8 applies because it deals with comparisons. Rule 17 applies because it considers negations. \nThe answer: The defeat was quick and decisive.", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The defeat of the Arab troops in the Six-Day War was a negative event for the Arab Muslim world. Therefore, rule 2 applies, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, \"pivotal event\" is equivalent to \"important negative event.\" Additionally, rule 8 applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, \"defeat\" is the antonym of \"victory.\" \nThe answer: a pivotal and negative event", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the sentence states that the defeat and economic stagnation were blamed on secular Arab nationalism. Therefore, the answer is that secular Arab nationalism was blamed for both the defeat of Arab troops and economic stagnation.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that there was a \"steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular, socialist and nationalist politics\" after the Six-Day War. This means that the credibility of secular politics decreased as a result of the war. Rule 1 applies because \"steep and steady decline\" means that the credibility of secular politics is less than it was before the war. Rule 3 applies because credibility is a different concept than size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the effect of the war on the credibility of secular politics. \nThe answer: It suffered a decline in popularity and credibility.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: Arab nationalism suffered a decline in popularity and credibility, which means it became less influential. According to rule 2, if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. Therefore, if Arab nationalism suffered, then different democratic and anti-democratic Islamist movements gained ground.\nThe answer: democratic and anti-democratic Islamist movements", "{rule list: 4, 19}\nExplanation: Mohammad Iqbal was an ideological father to the State of Pakistan.\nThe answer: ideological", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer is a person's name, which is equally important as a location. The relevant rule is 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts. This helps us identify that the answer is a person's profession or ideology. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, which confirms that the answer is a person's name. \nThe answer: Ali Shariati", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: Khomeini's beliefs are perceived to be placed somewhere between beliefs of Sunni Islamic thinkers like Mawdudi and Qutb, meaning that he is more similar to them than different from them, but not exactly the same. This can be inferred from the use of the word \"between.\" Additionally, the question uses the phrase \"as compared to,\" which implies a comparison and therefore the use of rule 2. \nThe answer: somewhere between", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"He believed that complete imitation of the Prophet Mohammad and his successors such as Ali for restoration of Sharia law was essential to Islam.\" Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of Iranian and Pakistani ideologues. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the use of \"not\" or other negations in the question. In this case, there are no negations in the question. \nThe answer: the Prophet Mohammad and his successors such as Ali", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the long term agenda behind the acts of plundering Muslim lands by the West. Rule 3 states that concepts such as age and color are different, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that Khomeini believed that the acts of plundering Muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam by the Western governments, so the answer is that the long term agenda was a conspiracy against Islam. \nThe answer: conspiracy against Islam", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the republic that has maintained control of Iran, which is a profession. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of \"Islamic\" in the question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the use of \"in spite of\" in the context. \nThe answer: The Islamic Republic", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. The question contains a synonym for \"supported\" in \"assisted.\" Negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: like-minded Shia terrorist groups", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the type of sanctions that the US has directed at Iran, which is a specific detail mentioned in the article. Rule 3 and 4 are relevant because they establish that concepts such as nationality and profession are different, and therefore the type of sanctions is not related to the Iranian government's actions or policies. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer, and the question specifically asks for \"what type\" of sanctions, implying that there are different types of sanctions that the US could have directed at Iran. \nThe answer: economic sanctions", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time when the Iranian government enjoyed a resurgence. The passage provides that this happened during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. This is a straightforward answer extraction task that requires identifying the relevant time period mentioned in the passage.\nThe answer: during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Ahmadinejad's statement is a negation, which is important for the answer. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant here, but the rule that negations are important for the answer is. \nThe answer: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the subject of the sentence \"In 1979, the Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army into Afghanistan\". Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the subject is the Soviet Union. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, so we know that the Soviet Union deployed its army into Afghanistan.\nThe answer: Soviet Union", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The question asks what the Soviet Union was trying to suppress, indicating a negation. The article states that the Soviet Union deployed its army into Afghanistan to suppress an Islamic rebellion against an allied Marxist regime in the Afghan Civil War. Therefore, the answer is an Islamic rebellion. \nThe answer: an Islamic rebellion", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: send aid and sometimes go themselves to fight for their faith", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the military effectiveness of the \"Afghan Arabs\" was marginal.\nThe answer: marginal", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 16,000 to 35,000", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The Gulf War inadvertently radicalized the Islamist movement in the early 1990s. This is because the war brought non-Muslim military personnel to Saudi Arabian soil, which led to accusations that the Saudi regime was a puppet of the west. The use of \"inadvertently\" in the question indicates a negation, which is important for the answer. Therefore, rules 1, 8, and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: It radicalized the Islamist movement.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the opposite of \"Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait\", which is the end of the occupation. Therefore, we need to apply rule 1 to determine that the US military personnel sought to put an end to the occupation. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait\" is more specific than \"occupation of Kuwait\", so we need to take the antonym of \"Saddam Hussein's\" to get the answer. \nThe answer: US military personnel sought to put an end to the occupation of Kuwait.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Islamist groups", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the monarchy that was protected by western troops, which is the subject of the passive sentence \"western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy.\" Therefore, we need to apply rules 16 and 23, which state that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb and that first comes before last and last comes after first. \nThe answer: The Saudi monarchy.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the entity that Islamists accused the Saudi regime of being a puppet of, which is a negation. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: the west", "{rule list: 1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The attacks resonated with conservative Muslims, which means that they did not resonate with non-conservative Muslims or other groups. The use of \"did not go away\" in the sentence indicates a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: conservative Muslims", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks what Saudi Arabia tried to repress, indicating a negation. Therefore, rule 17 applies. Additionally, the answer refers to a group that attacked Saudi Arabia, indicating that profession and nationality are different concepts (rule 3) and that the group has an opposite ideology to Saudi Arabia (rule 8). \nThe answer: domestic Islamists who attacked it", "{rule list: 3, 4, 12, 16}\nExplanation: American troops remained stationed in \"the kingdom,\" which is not explicitly stated to be Saudi Arabia but can be inferred from the context. Rule 3 applies to clarify that \"the kingdom\" is not a specific location or country. Rule 4 applies to clarify that \"the kingdom\" is not a nationality. Rule 12 applies to ignore irrelevant information about Saudi Arabia's attempts to compensate for its loss of prestige. Rule 16 applies to determine that the location of American troops comes after the mention of Saddam's defeat. \nThe answer: \"the kingdom\" (implied to be Saudi Arabia)", "{rule list: 2, 4, 6, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location where a civil war broke out. Rule 2 applies because \"bloody\" is a synonym for \"violent.\" Rule 4 applies because profession and nationality are different concepts, and the question does not ask for the nationality of the location. Rule 6 applies because animals and vehicles are different concepts, and the question does not ask for a vehicle involved in the civil war. Rule 12 applies because some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because negations are important for the answer, and the question is asking for a positive answer. \nThe answer: Algeria", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The article mentions \"bin Laden being a prime example\" of domestic Islamists attacking Saudi Arabia and being repressed by the government. \"Bin Laden\" refers to Osama bin Laden.\nThe answer: Osama bin Laden", "{1, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question uses the phrase \"increasingly radical,\" which implies a comparison between Qutb's ideas before and after his imprisonment. Rule 8 applies because the question uses the word \"increasingly,\" which implies a comparison between two different levels of radicalism. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"radical,\" which has a negative connotation and implies a departure from mainstream or moderate beliefs. \nThe answer: Qutb's ideas", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Qutb was imprisoned prior to his execution in 1966.\nThe answer: 1966", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Brotherhood", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of Qutb in the mid-1960s...did...develop and they pursued a more radical direction.\" This means that these movements were more radical than the Brotherhood, which had remained moderate. Therefore, we can apply rules 2 and 8 to infer that the Brotherhood was less radical than these fringe movements, and that these movements were more radical than the Brotherhood. \nThe answer: fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of Qutb in the mid-1960s", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals.\" This directly answers the question. Rule 3 is relevant because it reminds us that concepts such as violence and goals are different. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: By the 1970s.", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the subject of the sentence \"The path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.\" This is a passive sentence, so the subject is the entity that is being acted upon by the verb \"was taken up.\" Therefore, the answer is \"the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.\"\nThe answer: the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization", "{rule list: 17, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific event, which is the assassination of Anwar Sadat. The answer is found in the passage, which states that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization was responsible for the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981. The relevant rules are 17 and 23, which state that negations are important for the answer and that passive sentences have the subject acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: 1981", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: leaders of Muslim states who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the leaders were guilty of holding secular leanings or introducing/promoting Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies, which goes against the extremist group's beliefs. Therefore, they were considered \"apostate\" leaders of Muslim states. The word \"apostate\" means someone who has abandoned their religious or political beliefs, so the sin they were guilty of was abandoning their Islamic beliefs. \nThe answer: Abandoning their Islamic beliefs.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the author of a pamphlet outlining the radical ideas of the extremists. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for a name in the passage. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to make sure we are not looking for the author of a pamphlet outlining moderate ideas. The answer: Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag.", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order, which is a negation of peaceful means. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so \"employed violence\" cannot be interpreted as a profession. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so \"employed violence\" must be interpreted as a negation of peaceful means.\nThe answer: violence", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2003", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: unsuccessful", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Names are equally important for the answer, so it is relevant. \nThe answer: political figures", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a \"quiescent\" stance, focusing on preaching, education and social services, and benefiting from Israel's \"indulgence\" to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations.", "{1, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS ('zeal'), devoted to Jihad against Israel.\" The use of the word \"devoted\" indicates a strong commitment to this goal, which aligns with rule 1. The mention of HAMAS as an organization aligns with rule 4, which distinguishes between profession and nationality. The question uses the synonym \"Jihad\" for \"holy war,\" which aligns with rule 7. Finally, the use of the word \"against\" in the question indicates a negation, which aligns with rule 17. \nThe answer: HAMAS", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for what the Hamas charter \"uncompromisingly\" encouraged, indicating a strong stance. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"encouraged\" which is a synonym for \"called for\" in the context of the article. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for what the charter \"uncompromisingly\" encouraged, indicating a strong stance. \nThe answer: the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any irrelevant information about the members of the Brotherhood. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" allows us to infer that if the Brotherhood is against drinking alcohol, then they are in favor of abstaining from it. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" tells us that the answer is \"alcohol.\"\nThe answer: alcohol", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question asks where HAMAS wants to establish an Islamic state, implying that they do not currently have one. Therefore, the answer is \"in Palestine.\"", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the organization that has been causing disruption in Palestine. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answer choices that refer to a profession. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What organization has continued to be a major force of disruption in Palestine?\" Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negative connotation of \"disruptive force.\" \nThe answer: Hamas", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question specifically asks for the number of people Hamas killed between 2000 and 2007, which is a negation of the information provided in the article. Therefore, rules 17 and 18, which state that negations in both the question and context are important for the answer, are relevant.\nThe answer: 542", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the majority of the seats", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"In 2007 it drove the PLO out of Gaza\" is in the active voice, meaning that Hamas was the subject and the PLO was the object of the verb \"drove\". Therefore, the answer is 2007.\nThe answer: 2007", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: Muslims have praised Hamas for driving Israel out of the Gaza Strip, as stated in the passage. This answer is not affected by any of the other rules.\nThe answer: driving Israel out of the Gaza Strip", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being \"Islamic regime.\" The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is irrelevant to the question. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks for the type of regime, not the absence of a regime. Therefore, the answer is \"Islamist regime.\" \nThe answer: Islamist regime", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: We need to identify the leader of the Islamist regime in Sudan. Rule 1 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that the leader was also a minister of education. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer. Therefore, the answer is: Hassan al-Turabi.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: General Gaafar al-Nimeiry invited members of the National Islamic Front to serve in his government in 1979.\nThe answer: National Islamic Front", "{3, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding how Turabi built a strong economic base. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts like \"economic base\" are distinct from concepts like \"profession\" or \"nationality.\" Rule 4 reminds us that professions and political affiliations are also distinct. Rule 7 reminds us to look for synonyms or related concepts in the question and passage. Rule 13 reminds us that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign Islamist banking systems, especially those linked with Saudi Arabia.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Turabi placed sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education.\nThe answer: university and military academy", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify the time when al-Nimeiry was overthrown, which is a specific event in the past. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we need to look for the first mention of al-Nimeiry in the article. Rule 23 tells us that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", so we need to pay attention to the verb form to determine whether the sentence is active or passive. The sentence \"After al-Nimeiry was overthrown in 1985\" is in the passive voice, so al-Nimeiry was the subject of the action. Therefore, the answer is: 1985.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The party was able to overthrow the elected post-al-Nimeiry government with the help of the military.\nThe answer: with the help of the military", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: Turabi proclaimed his support for the democratic process before coming to power, but after coming into power, he strictly applied sharia law, tortured and imprisoned the opposition, and intensified the war in southern Sudan. Therefore, negations are important for the answer. Also, the use of \"strictly\" implies that Turabi applied sharia law in a very strict manner, making it the most appropriate answer.\nThe answer: sharia law", "{rule list: 13, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The NIF regime also harbored Osama bin Laden for a time (before 9/11).\" This sentence directly answers the question by stating that the NIF regime harbored Osama bin Laden prior to 9/11. The relevant rules are 13 (names are equally important for the answer), 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first), and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb), as they help identify the subject (NIF regime) and the object (Osama bin Laden) of the sentence. \nThe answer: Osama bin Laden", "{rule list: 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The question asks what the NIF tried to unify Islamist opposition against, which implies that the NIF was trying to bring together different groups of Islamists against a common enemy. The passage states that the NIF worked to unify Islamist opposition to the American attack on Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War. Therefore, the answer is: the American attack on Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the FIS advocated for gender segregation and for women to stay home to alleviate unemployment among young Algerian men. The use of \"force\" in the question implies a negative connotation, so rule 17 (negations are important for the answer) is also relevant. \nThe answer: stay home", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that the FIS was founded in 1989, which is a simple statement of fact. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the year 1989 refers to the founding of the FIS. Rule 23 is also relevant because it reminds us that passive voice can be used, so we need to look for the verb \"founded\" instead of \"founded by.\" \nThe answer: 1989", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the FIS was \"founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989.\" This means that the FIS was formed in Algeria.\nThe answer: Algeria", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Front Islamique de Salut", "{1, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant information in the passage is that the national elections in 1991 were canceled by a military coup d'\u00e9tat. Rule 1 applies because \"canceled\" is the antonym of \"won\" in the question. Rule 16 applies because \"1991\" comes before \"national elections\" in the question. Rule 23 applies because the sentence is in the passive voice. \nThe answer: a military coup d'\u00e9tat", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: The mujahideen's victory against the Soviets in the 1980s did not lead to justice and prosperity.\nThe answer: justice and prosperity", "{3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The first comes before last and last comes after first rule is also not relevant. However, the negations in the question and the fact that the question is asking for a specific type of civil war make rules 16 and 17 relevant. The answer is a \"vicious and destructive civil war.\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan happened after the mujahideen's victory against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is the action being described in the sentence. \nThe answer: 1992", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the civil war was \"vicious and destructive\" and that it left Afghanistan as \"one of the poorest countries on earth.\" This implies that the civil war had a negative impact on the state of Afghanistan's economy.\nThe answer: poor", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Taliban \"took over roughly 80% of Afghanistan.\" This is a clear and direct answer to the question.\nThe answer: roughly 80%", "{rule list: 1, 2, 4, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The Taliban were spawned by the thousands of madrasahs the Deobandi movement established.\" This means that the Deobandi movement established thousands of madrasahs that led to the creation of the Taliban.\nThe answer: the Deobandi movement", "{rule list: 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the source of support for the Taliban. Rule 4 reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can't assume that the support came from Afghan or Pakistani governments. Rule 7 reminds us that questions may contain synonyms, so \"governmental and religious groups\" could be replaced with \"state and religious organizations.\" Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to note that the support was not just from Afghan or Pakistani governments, but also from religious groups. \nThe answer: governmental and religious groups in neighboring Pakistan.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is \"Islamic fundamentalist or neofundamentalist\".", "{rule list: 3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The Taliban wanted to subject the entire country to an \"idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs\" under the label of Sharia. This is a concept related to religion and culture, which falls under the category of \"different concepts\" (rule 3). The Taliban's ideology was influenced by Wahhabism and extremist jihadism, which are both related to religion and ideology, falling under the category of \"different concepts\" (rule 4). The question contains the word \"subject\", which is a negation, and therefore important for the answer (rule 17).\nThe answer: an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs under the label of Sharia.", "{rule list: 4, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that the Taliban's ideology was influenced by Wahhabism and the extremist jihadism of Osama bin Laden. This falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 7, which allows for synonyms to be used in the question. \nThe answer: Wahhabism and Osama bin Laden", "{rule list: 1, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the subject and verb in the sentence \"In July 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq overthrew Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's regime in Pakistan.\" The subject is \"General Zia-ul-Haq\" and the verb is \"overthrew.\" Additionally, the order of the date and month in the sentence follows the day-month-year format commonly used in British English. Therefore, rules 1, 16, and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: July 1977.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that Bhutto had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months before he was overthrown. The use of \"announced banning\" indicates that the ban had not yet been implemented at the time of his overthrow, so the answer is \"alcohol and nightclubs\". \nThe answer: alcohol and nightclubs", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: Zia-ul-Haq's official state ideology was Islamism, which is a political ideology based on Islamic principles. This is a profession-related concept, as it refers to a set of beliefs and values that guide the actions of a government. Therefore, rule 4 applies, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Additionally, rule 8 applies, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, Zia-ul-Haq was more committed to Islamism than Ali Bhutto, who was a leftist in democratic competition with Islamists. Therefore, Ali Bhutto was less committed to Islamism than Zia-ul-Haq. \nThe answer: Islamism", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Profession and ideology are different concepts, negations are important for the answer, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. \nThe answer: his means of seizing power.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the date of Zia-ul-Haq's death. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the date of his death comes after the date of his overthrow in 1977. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can identify the passive sentence \"Zia-ul-Haq was killed in 1988\" as the answer.\nThe answer: 1988", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that The Islamic State is composed of Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria does not define its type. However, rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that The Islamic State is a Wahhabi/Salafi jihadist extremist militant group, so we can infer that it is not a peaceful or moderate group. Therefore, the answer is: extremist militant group.", "{4, 8, 20}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the leader's nationality is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Who does not lead The Islamic State?\" and look for the nationality of the leader. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so we know that the leader is male. \nThe answer: not applicable (since we are looking for the nationality of the leader, and not the leader himself)", "{rule list: 1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that as of March 2015, the Islamic State had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria. This means that the number of people under their control was more than 10 million, but less than the total population of Iraq and Syria combined. Rule 1 applies because it compares the number of people under their control to the total population of the two countries. Rule 2 applies because it clarifies that the Islamic State had the most control over the territories they occupied, and any other group or entity had less control. Rule 8 applies because it states that the number of people under their control is the opposite of the number of people not under their control. \nThe answer: ten million", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"While a self-described state, it lacks international recognition.\" This is a negation and therefore rule 17 applies. Additionally, the question uses the word \"lack\" which is also a negation. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply to ensure that the answer is not a concept related to size, shape, age, color, profession, or nationality. \nThe answer: international recognition", "{rule list: 2, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for what the Islamic State proclaimed itself, which is a statement of identity. Rule 2 applies because the question uses the word \"proclaim\" which implies a strong assertion of identity. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the positive statement, not the negative statement. \nThe answer: a caliphate", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2004", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces\" followed the Iraqi insurgency that the group participated in. This means that the invasion occurred in March 2003.\nThe answer: March 2003", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Al-Qaeda complained of ISIL's failure to consult and \"notorious intransigence\", indicating a negative relationship between the two groups. This is a case of negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: failure to consult and \"notorious intransigence\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: March 2011", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that \"The group has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and member states, the United States, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria and other countries.\" The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) and 17 (negations are important for the answer), as the question uses \"designed\" instead of \"designated.\" \nThe answer: a terrorist organization", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The party's view on Muslim history is being asked, which is a matter of belief and interpretation, not physical attributes. However, the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the party's view is contrasted with that of other Islamists, implying that they have different views. Therefore, the answer is that the party sees Islam's pivotal turning point as occurring with the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924, which it believes ended the true Islamic system.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the four rightly guided Caliphs are mentioned as a group, and there is no indication of their individual order. Therefore, the question cannot be answered.\nThe answer: Cannot be answered.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that age is a different concept from other concepts is irrelevant to the question. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B is relevant because the question asks for the year in which the Ottoman Caliphate was abolished, and the answer should reflect the opposite of \"abolished.\" \nThe answer: 1924", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article discusses the belief of the HT party that the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1924 ended the true Islamic system. This belief is based on the party's view of Muslim history, which sees the Caliphate as a pivotal turning point. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"system\" are different from concepts such as \"age\" or \"color.\" Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph.\nThe answer: the true Islamic system", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that negations are important for the answer is relevant because the question asks for what the colonial powers are blamed for. The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant because neither profession nor nationality are mentioned in the article. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts is not relevant because none of these concepts are mentioned in the article. The answer is: the abolition of the true Islamic system.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is \"armed jihad.\" The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is irrelevant. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks what type of jihad HT does not engage in. \nThe answer: armed jihad", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that HT does not engage in armed jihad or work for a democratic system, but instead works to take power through \"ideological struggle.\" Rule 4 applies because the article mentions that HT attempted and failed coups in Jordan and Egypt. Rule 17 applies because the question asks how HT strives to amass power, and the article states that they do so through \"ideological struggle\" and attempting \"bloodless\" coups. \nThe answer: Through \"ideological struggle\" and attempting \"bloodless\" coups.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: HT works to change Muslim public opinion, and in particular through elites who will \"facilitate\" a \"change of the government.\"\nThe answer: Muslim elites", "{rule list: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location where HT failed to pull off a bloodless coup in 1974. Rule 1 applies because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, the article states that HT failed to pull off coups in Jordan in 1968 and 1969, and in Egypt in 1974. Therefore, we can infer that the answer is Egypt. Rule 2 applies because it states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, the article states that HT works to take power through \"ideological struggle\" to change Muslim public opinion, and in particular through elites who will \"facilitate\" a \"change of the government,\" i.e., launch a \"bloodless\" coup. Therefore, we can infer that HT's goal is to take power through a bloodless coup. Rule 3 applies because it states that size,", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be \"Jordanian\" or \"Egyptian\". The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if HT does not engage in armed jihad or work for a democratic system, then the answer must be a group that does engage in those activities. \nThe answer: terrorist groups", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Greater London has over 900,000 Muslims.\nThe answer: over 900,000", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Some Muslims in London have a strong Islamist outlook.\nThe answer: Islamist outlook", "{rule list: 7, 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific date related to the airing of a documentary. Relevant rules include 7 (synonyms), 12 (irrelevant passages), 13 (names and locations), and 17 (negations). The answer can be found in the passage: \"heightened by expos\u00e9s such as the 2007 Channel 4 documentary programme Undercover Mosque.\" The answer is: 2007.", "{1, 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rules of 1 and 3 are used to understand that if a policy is perceived as hands-off, then it is not actively intervening. Rule 4 is used to understand that \"British policy\" refers to the policy of the British government. Rule 7 is used to understand that \"derogatory term\" means a negative or insulting term. Rule 17 is used to understand that \"perceived\" means that the term may not be accurate or true. \nThe answer: Londonistan", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: incitement to terrorism", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the U.S. government has been engaged in efforts to counter Islamism since 2001. This means that the government has been actively engaged in these efforts for at least 20 years (as of 2021). Additionally, since the question asks for a duration, rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant to ensure that the answer includes the full time period. \nThe answer: Since 2001.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the efforts against Islamism were centered around public diplomacy programs conducted by the State Department. The negation in the question (\"spearheaded\") is important to note, as it implies a leading role. \nThe answer: State Department", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific person who called for the creation of an agency to undermine the Islamism ideology. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the person's profession. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a statement that includes the word \"not\" or a similar negation. The only statement that fits these criteria is \"There have been calls to create an independent agency in the U.S. with a specific mission of undermining Islamism and jihadism.\" Therefore, the answer is: It is not specified who called for the creation of an agency to undermine the Islamism ideology.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: U.S. Defense Secretary", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The U.S. Information Agency was charged with undermining the communist ideology during the Cold War, which is a passive sentence where the subject (U.S. Information Agency) is acted upon the verb (charged with).\nThe answer: Undermining the communist ideology during the Cold War.", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking about the origin of the word imperialism, which is given in the passage as originating from the Latin word \"imperium\". \nThe answer: Latin", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility of the answer being a specific profession or nationality. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is also not relevant. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is not relevant either. The answer can be found in the sentence \"Imperialism is 'a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means'.\" This sentence indicates that imperialism can be administered through colonization, use of military force, or other means. \nThe answer: colonization, use of military force, or other means", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The rules state that nationality is a different concept from profession, size, shape, age, and color, and that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for an eastern country that has been applied the term imperialism to. Therefore, the answer is none, as the question is negated and asks for a country that has not been applied the term imperialism to. \nThe answer: none", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage states that imperialism has allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas. This fits under rule 3, which states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different from each other. The answer is \"technologies and ideas\".\nThe answer: technologies and ideas", "{1, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"extending a country's power\" implies that the country has more power than before, and therefore other countries have less power in comparison. Rule 4 applies because \"country's power\" refers to a political entity, while \"nationality\" refers to an individual's identity. \nThe answer: influence", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the type of imperialism that involves physical control or full-fledged colonial rule. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"type of imperialism\" can be considered synonymous with \"form of imperialism\". Therefore, the answer is \"formal imperialism\". \n\nThe answer: formal imperialism", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that imperialism often uses \"othering\" based on racial, religious, or cultural stereotypes to divide countries. This aligns with rule 3, which states that concepts such as race and culture are distinct, and rule 7, which allows for synonyms to be used in the question. \nThe answer: \"othering\" based on stereotypes", "{2, 8}\nExplanation: \"Informal imperialism\" is still a powerful form of dominance, but it is less direct.\nThe answer: direct", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the concept of imperialism and how it can take on different forms, including \"informal\" imperialism which involves less direct rule but still contains perceivable kinds of dominance. The passage also mentions that one way to enforce this dominance is through \"uneven trade agreements forcefully.\" This implies that a forced trade agreement between two countries would be an example of informal imperialism.\nThe answer: informal imperialism", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. These rules are not directly applicable to the question, but they help eliminate any confusion about what imperialism refers to in the context. The answer to the question is \"formal imperialism\".", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a generalization of the meaning of imperialism. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"general-purpose.\" The passage mentions \"simply, general-purpose aggressiveness\" and \"all kinds of domination or control,\" so we can infer that the answer is \"domination or control.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: domination or control", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a subtle tool used in an informal imperialistic situation to expand a controlled area. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if a subtle tool is used to expand a controlled area, then forceful methods are not used. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negation in the question. The answer is ownership of private industries. \nThe answer: ownership of private industries", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks which type of imperialism is more costly, and the passage explains that informal rule is generally less costly than formal rule. Therefore, the answer is that formal imperialism is more costly. \nThe answer: formal imperialism", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so \"amount of land\" is not related to any of these concepts. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the amount of land a country controls is its greatest \"expansion\", then its antonym is \"reduction\". Therefore, the answer is \"reduction\". \nThe answer: reduction", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about the theory that divided the world according to how developed and developing nations are portrayed. This is referring to the world systems theory, which is a critical theory of geopolitics. The answer is not affected by gender, names, locations, or irrelevant passages. Negations are important, as the question asks for the theory that divided the world, not united it. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 7 (synonyms), 12 (irrelevant passages), 13 (names and locations are equally important), and 17 (negations). \nThe answer: world systems theory", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lenin", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an empire", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". This means that most imperialism was carried out using sea transport.\nThe answer: sea transport", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The article explains that imperialism is often conflated with colonialism, but they have distinct definitions. Rule 3 states that concepts like size, shape, age, and color are different, so imperialism and colonialism cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"confused\" can be used instead of \"conflated\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so \"confused with\" indicates that the answer is not imperialism, but rather another term that is often used in place of it. \nThe answer: colonialism", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, while rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. In the given context, the article discusses the difference between imperialism and colonialism, and how each has its own distinct definition. The question asks for what colonialism lacks that imperialism has, implying that the two concepts are different. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are relevant in understanding that the answer should be a concept that is unique to imperialism and not present in colonialism. \nThe answer: a state policy and ideological reasons", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that colonialism is developed for settlement or commercial intentions, which can be interpreted as financial reasons. Rule 3 states that concepts such as finance are different from concepts such as profession or nationality. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means that \"caused by\" can be synonymous with \"developed for\". Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question.\nThe answer: settlement intentions", "{3, 4, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. The question contains a synonym for \"excluded\" which is \"left out.\" Some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer. Negations are important for the answer. The answer: Ottoman.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. These rules help us understand that imperialism and colonialism both assert a state's dominance over a person or group of people.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that political advantage is not related to size, shape, age, or color. Therefore, the answer cannot be related to any of these concepts. The answer must be related to state policies, which is a different concept from the others. \nThe answer: colonialism and imperialism", "{3, 5, 9, 17}\nExplanation: Colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another and exploiting its valuable assets and supplies. It can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure, and economics of an area. Negation is important for the answer as the question asks for what colonialism often means, implying that it can have other meanings as well. \nThe answer: taking physical control of another country", "{3, 4, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance over a land and its indigenous populations, either formally or informally. To create an empire through imperialism, a country would need to conquer other states' lands and increase its own dominance. The conquered lands would then become part of the empire. \nThe answer: By conquering other states' lands and increasing its own dominance.", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: Colonialism is the process of a country taking physical control of another and exploiting its valuable assets and supplies, with the conquering nation gaining the benefits from the spoils of war.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.\nThe answer: characteristics", "{1, 3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between imperialism and its defense and justification. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including imperialism and its justification. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for the use of synonyms in the question. Rule 17 is relevant because it acknowledges the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: The defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Ratzel believed that imperialism was necessary for a state to survive, implying that without it, a state would be less likely to survive. Rule 3 applies because \"state\" and \"survive\" are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what Ratzel believed was necessary, implying a negation of the opposite. \nThe answer: imperialism", "{rule list: 1, 2, 8}\nExplanation: J. A. Hobson believed that the races of highest \"social efficiency\" should develop the world. This statement implies that he believed some races were more efficient than others, which falls under rule 1. Additionally, the use of \"highest\" implies a comparison between races, which falls under rule 2. Finally, the use of \"social efficiency\" and the context of imperialism suggest a positive connotation to Hobson's statement, which falls under rule 8.\nThe answer: races of highest \"social efficiency\"", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a theory that justifies imperialism, which is a concept. Rule 3 states that concepts such as imperialism cannot be compared to physical attributes such as size or shape. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms, so \"theory\" can be replaced with \"justification.\" Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a theory that justifies imperialism in part. \nThe answer: \"Social Darwinism\" and a theory of races", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: whiteness", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the name of the person and their place of birth.\nThe answer: Germany.", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Halford Mackinder's nationality is being asked, which falls under rule 4. The question asks for his place of birth, which is a specific detail that can be found using rule 16.\nThe answer: Britain", "{4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can infer that Halford Mackinder and Friedrich Ratzel are not defined by their nationality, but by their profession as geographers. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if Halford Mackinder and Friedrich Ratzel supported imperialism, they are not pacifist geographers. \nThe answer: political geographers", "{rule list: 1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Ratzel believed that expansion was necessary for a state's survival.\nThe answer: necessary for a state's survival", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The geographical societies in Europe were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries. They also served as a space for travelers to share these stories.\nThe answer: They would fund them and provide a space for them to share their stories.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a theory that suggests people in the tropics were uncivilized, which is a negation. Rule 3 states that concepts such as geography and profession are different, so we can ignore the mention of geographer Ellen Churchill Semple. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can look for a theory that suggests people in the tropics are less civilized than those in other regions. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"uncivilized\". The answer is environmental determinism. \nThe answer: environmental determinism", "{rule list: 3, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Ellen Churchill Semple's theory is an example of environmental determinism, which suggests that the environment shapes human behavior and culture. The question asks for the specific type of climate that Semple believed was necessary for humans to become fully human. The answer is the temperate zone. The rules used are 3 (climate is a different concept from humans), 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A), 16 (first comes before last), and 17 (negations are important for the answer).", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which mentions \"Edward Said's Orientalism.\" Rule 3 tells us that concepts such as \"tropicality\" and \"Orientalism\" are different from each other. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any mention of Ellen Churchill Semple's profession as a geographer. Rule 7 tells us that synonyms in the question are important, so we can look for a reference to \"the east\" or \"others\" in relation to Said's work. Rule 17 tells us that negations in the question are important, so we can note that the question asks for the book that portrays the east as the \"others.\" \nThe answer: Orientalism", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that some geographical theories suggest that tropical environments create uncivilized people. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about the type of human produced by a tropical climate, which is a concept related to geography. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the type of human produced by a tropical climate, which is the opposite of what the geographical theories suggest. \nThe answer: uncivilized people", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking about Europe's self-perception based on certain theories. Rule 3 and 4 remind us that concepts such as race and geography are different and should not be conflated. Rule 8 tells us that if Europe justified its dominance based on certain theories, then those theories must have been seen as superior. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important, so we need to look for the opposite of what Europe thought of itself. \nThe answer: superior and the norm", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage mentions the concept of Terra nullius, which is a Latin expression that means \"empty land\". This concept was used by British imperialism to justify their settlement and colonial rule of Australia. Therefore, the answer is that the concept of Terra nullius justified British imperialism. \nThe answer: Terra nullius", "{rule list: 3, 13}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Great Britain settled and colonized Australia in the eighteenth century, based on the concept of Terra nullius. This information is directly relevant to the question and does not violate any of the relevant rules.\nThe answer: in the eighteenth century", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The concept of imperialism is not associated with any specific sovereignty, so rule 3 applies. The article mentions the policies and practices of the British Empire, so rule 4 applies to distinguish between profession and nationality. The question asks for a sovereignty associated with imperialism, so rule 8 applies to infer that the answer is not a sovereignty associated with anti-imperialism.\nThe answer: None (imperialism is not associated with any specific sovereignty)", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Aboriginals", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: Terra Nullius is a Latin expression that means 'empty land'.\nThe answer: 'empty land'", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the West developed an X of the East, then X must be the antonym of something positive. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the answer must be the opposite of something positive. Therefore, the answer is: an imaginative geography.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: irrational and backward", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: irrational and backward", "{3, 17, 23}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the discourse of Orientalism served as an ideological justification for Western imperialism, allowing the West to dominate and control the East. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as place-based identities and social reality. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks about what was used to justify control, implying a negation. Rule 23 is relevant because it explains the difference between active and passive sentences, which is important for understanding the passage. \nThe answer: The discourse of Orientalism", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a comparison between the West and the East. Rules 1 and 2 are relevant for comparisons. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant for this question. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is also not relevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which is relevant for understanding the question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant for understanding the question. The answer is: the West saw themselves as rational and progressive compared to the East, which was positioned as irrational and backward.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question uses the phrase \"to illustrate his idea\", which implies a comparison between two things. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves a concept, specifically the role of nineteenth-century maps. \nThe answer: The role of nineteenth-century maps during the \"scramble for Africa\".", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the use of blank space on maps to denote unexplored territory provided an incentive for imperial and colonial powers to obtain information and fill in those blank spaces on maps. This implies that the lack of knowledge about certain areas of Africa incentivized western empires to colonize the continent. \nThe answer: lack of knowledge about certain areas of Africa", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 and 17. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which means that blank space on a map is not related to any of these concepts. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the negation is the word \"unknown\" or \"unexplored\". Therefore, the answer is: Blank spaces were used to denote unknown or unexplored territory.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the role of nineteenth-century maps during the \"scramble for Africa\"", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The article does not provide any information about which other countries besides Britain colonized Africa. The irrelevant information about Bassett's analysis of maps and their role in promoting imperialism can be ignored.\nThe answer: N/A", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists various empires throughout history, but the question specifically asks about the Aztec and Incan empires. Rule 3 reminds us that age is a different concept from other characteristics, so we can ignore the other empires mentioned. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last,\" so we can determine that the Aztec Empire and the Incan Empire both existed during the pre-Columbian era.\nThe answer: pre-Columbian era", "{rule list: 23, 24, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the subject who used imperialism during their rule of the Mongol Empire, which is a passive construction. Therefore, we need to apply rules 23 and 24 to identify the subject of the sentence. Additionally, we need to apply rule 20 to correctly identify the pronoun referring to the subject. \nThe answer: Genghis Khan", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Muslim empires are mentioned in the passage, but there is no indication of how many have used imperialism. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the empires are Muslim does not necessarily mean they used imperialism. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if there were any Muslim empires that did not use imperialism, then the answer would be \"none\". \nThe answer: None.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that age is a different concept from other characteristics, and Rule 16 states that first comes before last. \nThe answer: The Ethiopian Empire predates the British Empire.", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The rules indicate that regions and empires are different concepts, and that names are important for the answer. The answer: The Asante and Lunda Empires were in Sub-Saharan Africa.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article defines cultural imperialism as the impact of a country's soft power on the moral, cultural, and societal worldview of another, changing their own expectations of life and desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. This goes beyond just the popularity of foreign music, television, or film. The question asks for the term used when imperialism impacts social norms, which is cultural imperialism.\nThe answer: cultural imperialism", "{rule list: 1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: Cultural imperialism is a term used to describe a country's influence on the social and cultural circles of another country, changing their moral, cultural, and societal worldview. This is more than just the popularity of foreign music, television, or film, but rather a change in the expectations of life and a desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. Negations are important for the answer because the question asks for the term often used to refer to Cultural Imperialism.\nThe answer: Cultural Imperialism", "{1, 2, 7}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the American show that changed the expectations of Romanians during the Cold War. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A changes B, then B is changed by A. Rule 2 is relevant because it establishes that if A changes B and C, then A is the most responsible for the change in B and C is the least responsible. Rule 7 is relevant because it establishes that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph. \nThe answer: Dallas", "{3, 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the Roman empire used cultural imperialism to influence local elites. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including empires and their actions. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including nationality and actions taken by a country or empire. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes the order of events, in this case the Roman empire coming before the present day. Rule 17 is relevant because it acknowledges the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Roman empire", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer mentions bans on foreign popular culture and control of the internet, which are examples of regimes fighting against cultural imperialism. The relevant rules are 3 (distinguishing between concepts), 4 (distinguishing between profession and nationality), and 17 (negations are important for the answer).\nThe answer: Bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet, and unauthorised satellite dishes.", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period, which can be answered by identifying the time period mentioned in the article. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can assume that the Age of Imperialism began sometime after 1700. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we should note that the article mentions that imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years, but the term \"Age of Imperialism\" specifically refers to the activities of European powers from the early 18th century through to the middle of the 20th century. \nThe answer: around 1700", "{rule list: 3, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: European industrializing nations were engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power during the Age of Imperialism, which began around 1700.\nThe answer: colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years.\" This means that the number of years is more than 1000, so we can use rule 3 to infer that the answer is not a specific number. Instead, we can use rule 8 to infer that the answer is \"more than 1000 years.\" \nThe answer: thousands of years", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage does not provide a specific end date for the Age of Imperialism, but it does state that it lasted from the early 18th century to the middle of the 20th century. Therefore, we can infer that the Age of Imperialism ended sometime in the mid-1900s. \nThe answer: mid-1900s", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 7 (questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph), and 17 (negations are important for the answer). The question asks for the name of an imperialistic policy in China, so we can infer that the policy was implemented by a foreign power. The article mentions the \"Open Door Policy\" in China, which was an imperialistic policy implemented by various foreign powers to gain access to Chinese markets. Therefore, the answer is the \"Open Door Policy\". \nThe answer: Open Door Policy", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the birth year of John Gallagher, a historian mentioned in the article. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to look for information about Gallagher's birth year. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so we can assume that any pronouns referring to Gallagher will use \"he.\" \nThe answer: 1919", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 helps us understand that \"Ronald Robinson\" comes after \"John Gallagher\" in the article. The rule 23 helps us understand that \"Ronald Robinson\" is the subject of the sentence \"During the 20th century, historians John Gallagher (1919\u20131980) and Ronald Robinson (1920\u20131999) constructed a framework for understanding European imperialism.\" Therefore, Ronald Robinson died in 1999.\nThe answer: 1999", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: Robinson and Gallagher were historians.\nThe answer: historians", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected as a result of imperialism. This growth is a different concept from the formal, legal control of one government over another country (rule 3). The passage also distinguishes between formal empire and the bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital that went to areas outside the formal British Empire (rule 4). The question uses the synonym \"grew\" to refer to the economic growth mentioned in the passage (rule 7), and the negation \"as a result of imperialism\" is important for identifying the cause of this growth (rule 17).\nThe answer: the world's economy", "{3, 4, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for who became rich and prosperous prior to World War I, which is a positive statement. Therefore, we need to apply rule 17 to consider negations in the question. Rules 3, 4, and 5 are relevant to ensure that we do not confuse concepts such as nationality, profession, and animals with the concept of being rich and prosperous. \nThe answer: the many imperial powers", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article discusses how Europe's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth. Rule 4 applies because the article distinguishes between economic growth and assuming political control. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the focus of European imperialism, which is a negation of what it was not necessarily valid for in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \nThe answer: economic growth", "{rule list: 3, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period, which can be found in the context paragraph. Rules 3 and 12 help to identify the relevant information about the colonization of India, while rule 8 helps to understand that the question is asking for a specific time period. Rule 17 is relevant because the question is asking for an affirmative answer, and the negation \"not\" is important to note. \nThe answer: mid-18th century", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage states that European expansion into imperialism was focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies. This implies that European empires relied on colonies to supply them with resources.\nThe answer: colonies", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article compares the British exploitation of the political weakness of the Mughal state to military and political means. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for a specific group of people, and the answer is a nationality. Rule 17 applies because the question uses the word \"not\" which is a negation. \nThe answer: local elites", "{3, 4, 5}\nExplanation: The passage only mentions advancements in communication and military technology, so rule 3 (different concepts) and rule 5 (animals and vehicles are different concepts) are not relevant. Rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) is also not relevant. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other advancements mentioned in the article besides communication and military technology.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: European chemists made deadly explosives that could be used in combat.\nThe answer: explosives", "{2, 3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage discusses advancements in military technology in Europe, including the invention of deadly explosives and improved firearms. By the 1880s, the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon, giving European armies an advantage over their opponents. Therefore, the answer is the machine gun. \nThe answer: the machine gun", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. This indicates that the Zulus were using these weapons.\nThe answer: arrows, swords, and leather shields", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"European chemists made deadly explosives\" and \"by the 1880s, the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon.\" This implies that Europe invented the machine gun.\nThe answer: Europe", "{3, 8, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if theories on imperialism are based on the British experience, then they are also based on the experiences of other countries. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the answer is that there is no specific country that theories on imperialism use as a model.", "{rule list} 1, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18\nExplanation: The question asks for when the term \"imperialism\" was first used in its current sense, which implies a change in definition. Rules 1 and 8 are relevant because they deal with comparisons and antonyms, respectively, which are important for understanding the change in definition. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant, but contractions are not, so we need to understand the meaning of \"its\" in \"its present sense.\" Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant, so we can ignore the parts of the article that discuss different theories of imperialism. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks about a negation (\"when did the term imperialism first come to be used by its current definition?\"). Rule 18 is also relevant because the question asks about the definition of a term. \nThe answer: In the late 1870s.", "{rule list: 2, 17}\nExplanation: The term \"imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy. \nThe answer: idealism and philanthropy", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Capitalistic economies need to constantly expand investment, material resources, and manpower, which necessitates colonial expansion.\nThe answer: To constantly expand investment, material resources, and manpower.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article discusses the correlation between capitalism and imperialism, and the debate surrounding it. The answer is \"aristocracy\". \nThe answer: aristocracy", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: from the 1950s", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time period when Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell were most prolific in their writing. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that we can determine the order of the writers based on their birth year. Schumpeter was born in 1883 and Angell was born in 1872, so Angell was born first and Schumpeter was born last. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to look for a negation in the question. The question asks for the time period when the writers were \"most prolific,\" which means we need to find the time when they were not most prolific. Therefore, the answer is any time period except for the time when they were most prolific.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that if Hobson argued that imperialism was an international disease, then he believed it to be a negative force. \nThe answer: disease", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation through state intervention via taxation to boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.\nThe answer: Through domestic social reforms and state intervention via taxation to boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the concept of environmental determinism was used as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples, which is a form of imperialism. Rule 3 emphasizes that concepts such as environmental determinism are different from concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 4 emphasizes that profession and nationality are different concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which applies to the question as it asks for the justification for imperialism, not the justification for not imposing imperialism. Rule 17 emphasizes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Environmental determinism", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article discusses how people's behaviors were believed to be determined by their environment. Rule 3 applies because behavior and environment are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what was believed to determine behavior, indicating a negation. \nThe answer: the environment in which they lived", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the description of people living in tropical environments. Rule 3 tells us that we need to consider concepts such as environment and behavior as different. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. The answer is \"less civilized\". \nThe answer: \"less civilized\"", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that nationality and location are different concepts, and that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Therefore, we can infer that the third continent to be colonized after the Americas and Asia was Africa.\nThe answer: Africa", "{3, 4, 5, 7}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how environmental determinism was used to categorize indigenous people in a racial hierarchy during European colonialism. This categorization took two forms: orientalism and tropicality. \nThe answer: orientalism and tropicality.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Scholars under colonizing empires\nThe answer: Scholars under colonizing empires", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"climate\" is a different concept from \"region\" applies, as the question is asking about climate specifically. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies, as the question is asking for the opposite of \"tropical climates.\" \nThe answer: Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The Europeans believed that the people in the tropics were in need of guidance and intervention from the European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure. This is a negation question, so rule 17 applies. Additionally, rule 3 applies as it distinguishes between concepts such as climate and attitudes. Rule 8 applies as it deals with antonyms. \nThe answer: guidance and intervention from the European empire", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a term used to describe a view of a people based on their geographical location, which is similar to the concept of orientalism. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, but there are no synonyms in this question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. \nThe answer: There is no specific term given in the article.", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the scholars were geographic scholars does not necessarily imply a specific employer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and since the question is asking for who the scholars worked for, the negation \"under colonizing empires\" implies that the scholars were not working for themselves, but rather for the colonizing empires. \nThe answer: colonizing empires", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the sixteenth century is the earliest time period mentioned in the article. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us understand that the sentence \"Britain's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century\" is in the passive voice, with \"sixteenth century\" being the subject and \"imperialist ambitions\" being the object. \nThe answer: The sixteenth century.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the establishment of the British East India Company is mentioned first in the paragraph. The rule that \"age\" is a different concept from \"profession\" or \"nationality\" helps us identify that the date of establishment is the answer, not the nationality or profession of the company.\nThe answer: 1599", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Queen Elizabeth", "{rule list: 16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: In 1767, political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy. This is a passive sentence, so we know that the subject (East India Company) was acted upon (plundered) by an unknown agent. Therefore, we can use rules 16 and 17 to determine that the question should be answered in the passive voice. Additionally, we can use rule 23 to understand the difference between active and passive sentences. \nThe answer: The East India Company was plundered, almost bringing it into bankruptcy.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that the answer must refer to a specific country. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" means that the answer must refer to a country that existed before Britain. \nThe answer: Portugal", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Algeria is a location and its acquisition by France is a historical event, so rule 3 applies to distinguish them. The question asks for a specific time, so rule 16 applies to prioritize temporal information.\nThe answer: 1830", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: France began in earnest to rebuild its global empire after 1850.\nThe answer: 1850", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 separates religion from the concepts of size, shape, age, and color. Rule 4 separates religion from the concept of nationality. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Catholicism", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that France concentrated its efforts in North and West Africa, as well as South-East Asia, with other conquests in Central and East Africa, as well as the South Pacific. The rule that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and the rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, apply here to eliminate any confusion about what \"focus\" means. \nThe answer: France focused its efforts to rebuild its empire in North and West Africa, South-East Asia, Central and East Africa, and the South Pacific.", "{rule list: 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: French Republicans were initially hostile to empire, but they became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire, which is a negation. Therefore, rules 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 8 (if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B), and 17 (negations are important for the answer) are relevant.\nThe answer: When Germany started to build her own colonial empire.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"higher\" is a comparative term. Rule 3 applies because \"duty\" is a different concept from \"civilizing.\" Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the opposite of what Jules Ferry believed. \nThe answer: Jules Ferry thought that the \"higher races\" have a duty to civilize the inferior.", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that France offered \"full citizenship rights - 'assimilation'\". Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as size, shape, age, and color, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is important for understanding that France offering assimilation was rare compared to other imperial powers. \nThe answer: full citizenship rights/assimilation", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority. This contrasts with Britain's approach to managing its colonies. \nThe answer: France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, while Britain did not.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The French believed in bringing Christianity and French culture to uplift other regions.\nThe answer: Christianity and French culture", "{3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rules state that nationality and profession are different concepts, and if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the passage states that \"Contrasting from Britain, France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority.\" Therefore, the answer is Algeria.\nThe answer: Algeria", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: overseas colonies", "{1, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for what challenged the French empire after 1945, indicating a negation. Therefore, rule 17 applies. Rule 1 applies because it is necessary to understand that the anti-colonial movements were a result of France's use of its colonies in World War II. The answer is anti-colonial movements. \n\nThe answer: anti-colonial movements", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is a location where France lost a war. Rule 3 tells us that location is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 4 tells us that location is a different concept from profession and nationality. Rule 5 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts from locations. Rule 6 tells us that animals and vehicles are different concepts from each other. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, which may be relevant for identifying the time period in which the war occurred. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Vietnam", "{rule list: 3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts, so the location of the war is not relevant. The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the nationality of the opposing force is not relevant. The rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer is \"Algeria\".\nThe answer: Algeria.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a specific time frame, so rule 3 (size, shape, age, and color are different concepts) and rule 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) are not relevant. However, rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is relevant as it helps us understand that the question is asking for a specific point in time. The answer is: by 1960.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Germanic tribes were originally from Scandinavia and northern Europe, which indicates a location. The article also mentions their expansion into other regions, but the question specifically asks for their original location.\nThe answer: Scandinavia and northern Europe", "{3, 10, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be confused with the concept of region. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore any potential typos. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negation in the question. \nThe answer: Muslim Iberia", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Germanic tribes expanded throughout northern and western Europe in the middle period of classical antiquity. This means that they claimed territory in north and west Europe during the middle period of classical antiquity. Additionally, since the passage mentions the formation of the Holy Roman Empire by 800 CE, we can infer that the Germanic conquest of central, western, and southern Europe was complete by that time. \nThe answer: during the middle period of classical antiquity", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: late antiquity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. This means that just because an area is referred to as \"Germany\" does not necessarily mean it is a country with defined borders. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"Germany\" is more of a conceptual term than an actual country, so the answer is \"an amorphous area of central Europe.\"", "{3, 16, 18}\nExplanation: Germany's participation in Western imperialism was negligible until the late 19th century.\nThe answer: late 19th century", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" Therefore, we can infer that Bismarck's birthdate is not mentioned in the article, as it is not relevant to the topic at hand.\nThe answer: N/A", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that after the defeat of Napoleon, Prussia and the German states continued to stand aloof from imperialism, preferring to manipulate the European system through the Concert of Europe. After Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire after the Franco-German War. This means that the second German Empire was founded after the Franco-German War.\nThe answer: after the Franco-German War", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The article states that \"After the defeat of Napoleon, who caused the dissolution of that Holy Roman Empire...\".\nThe answer: Napoleon", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Germany's central interest was Europe, as stated in the passage and inferred from the fact that they preferred to manipulate the European system through the Concert of Europe and that Otto von Bismarck argued that diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract Germany from its central interest, Europe itself.\nThe answer: Europe", "{3, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a location where Germany had imperial interests besides Africa. Rule 3 and 7 indicate that location and other concepts are different, so we can focus on information related to locations. Rule 4 indicates that nationality is a different concept, so we can ignore information related to Germans. Rule 17 indicates that negations are important, so we need to look for information that explicitly states that Germany did or did not have imperial interests in a certain location. The answer: the South Pacific.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the reason why European countries wanted colonies. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that colonies were a sign of power or prestige among European countries. \nThe answer: power/prestige", "{1, 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares Germany's colonial empire building before and after 1883-84. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the founding of a settlement, which is a different concept from building an empire. Rule 12 applies because the article provides additional information about Germany's colonial empire that is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question contains a negation. \nThe answer: 1884.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of the first German settlement, which is a specific piece of information. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" meaning that the first colony established would be the one mentioned first in the article. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"The establishment of the German colonial empire proceeded smoothly, starting with German New Guinea in 1884\" is in the active voice and states that German New Guinea was the first colony established. \nThe answer: German New Guinea", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: Bismarck was influenced by Hamburg merchants and traders, who were his neighbors at Friedrichsruh.\nThe answer: Hamburg merchants and traders", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: Japan took part of Sakhalin Island from Russia.\nThe answer: Japan took part of Sakhalin Island from Russia.", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year of the first Sino-Japanese War, which is an event in the past. Therefore, we need to use rule 16 to determine that events in the past should be ordered chronologically. We also need to take into account negations, as the question asks for the year of the war, not the year it did not happen. Therefore, we need to use rule 17 to consider negations in the question.\nThe answer: 1894", "{4, 20}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts means that the answer cannot be a profession, so we can eliminate that possibility. The rule that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names means that we can determine the gender of the country that Japan forced into an alliance. The answer: Thailand.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 7, 13}\nExplanation: Japan conquered Manchuria from China.\nThe answer: Manchuria", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks about a country or countries that supported post WW-II communist movements. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we cannot assume that a person's nationality is the same as their profession. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the use of \"not always successful\" in the context. The answer: The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify when the policy of \"Indigenization\" stopped being implemented, which is a negation. Therefore, we need to apply rule 17. Additionally, we need to be careful with the word \"defunded\" in the question, which is a negation. Therefore, we also need to apply rule 8 to get the antonym of \"implemented.\" Finally, we can ignore the irrelevant information about the Soviet Union and China. \nThe answer: after 1932.", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who asserted Russia's right to \"self-determination.\" The concept of \"self-determination\" falls under the category of \"topics\" that are the shared authority of the states and the federation, as stated in the German constitution. Therefore, rule 3 applies. The question contains a negation (\"not always successful\"), so rule 17 applies. Finally, there is no mention of a specific person in the article, so rule 8 applies. \nThe answer: N/A (cannot be answered from the given article)", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: We need to identify the location where Russia applied its old Tsarist regimes after World War II. Rule 3 tells us that location is a different concept from other concepts like ideology or time. Rule 4 tells us that nationality is a different concept from profession. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, the answer is: in areas its forces occupied in Eastern Europe.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Bolshevik leaders", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: Trotsky believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution, meaning that it needed to be a global movement rather than just a local one. This is an example of rule 1, where A (world revolution) is more needed than B (local revolution). Additionally, this can be interpreted as Trotsky believing that a true Russian revolution required a global revolution, making the global revolution the most important factor and the local revolution the least important. This is an example of rule 2, where A (global revolution) is most needed and B (local revolution) is least needed. \nThe answer: A world revolution", "{3, 4, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where Lenin is mentioned as having written extensively on the matter and famously declaring that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. Rules 3 and 4 are relevant to ensure that size, shape, age, and color, as well as profession and nationality, are not confused with the concept of imperialism. Rule 12 is relevant to ignore irrelevant passages in the context. Rule 17 is relevant to consider negations in the question, as the question asks for the author of a statement, not for someone who disagreed with it. \nThe answer: Lenin", "{rule list: 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying who argued that the USSR had become an imperialist power. Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we need to focus on the person's name rather than their nationality. Rule 8 is relevant because it tells us that if someone argues that A is more X than B, then we can infer that they believe B is more antonym(X) than A. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Mao Zedong", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the leader of Russia in the 1960s, which refers to the head of state or government of the Soviet Union. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer should not refer to the person's profession but rather their position as a leader. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer should refer to the first and last name of the leader. \nThe answer: Nikita Khrushchev", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 'socialism in one country'", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. The answer to the question is \"mercantilism,\" which is a concept related to economics and trade, not to size, shape, age, or color, nor to nationality. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are the most relevant. \nThe answer: mercantilism", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the loss of the American colonies occurred in 1776, which is a specific date and therefore falls under rule 16. The question asks for when this event occurred, which is a straightforward factual question and does not require any additional rules.\nThe answer: 1776", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to a policy that gave Britain dominance in world trade, so we can eliminate rules 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, and 22. The answer is not affected by typos or contractions, so we can eliminate rules 10 and 11. The answer is not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles, so we can eliminate rules 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The answer is not affected by the gender of the subject, so we can eliminate rules 19, 20, and 21. The answer is not related to the order of events, so we can eliminate rule 16. The answer is not related to the passive or active voice, so we can eliminate rules 23 and 24. The answer is related to a policy that gave Britain dominance in world trade, so we can", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: about 1820", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In this case, the defeat of Napoleonic France is mentioned after the year 1815, which is when the defeat occurred.\nThe answer: 1815", "{3, 4, 8, 16, 17}\nExplanation: Size and power are different concepts, so rule 3 applies. The question asks about a country, so nationality is relevant, making rule 4 applicable. The question uses the phrase \"largest empire ever to exist in the world,\" which implies a comparison, so rule 8 applies. The question specifies the time period as the late 19th century, so rule 16 applies. The question does not contain any negations, so rule 17 is not applicable.\nThe answer: British Empire", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The third rule states that different concepts, such as sciences, should not be confused with each other. The eighth rule states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"pseudo-sciences\" is used to describe both Social Darwinism and theories of race, indicating that they are not legitimate sciences. \nThe answer: pseudo-sciences", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: Rudyard Kipling is mentioned as one of the influential spokesmen during the late 19th century British imperialism. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we cannot assume that Kipling's nationality automatically determines his profession. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can infer that Kipling was an influential spokesman for British imperialism. \nThe answer: British imperialism", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that we need to pay attention to the specific regions mentioned in the article. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant here. \nThe answer: Africa", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the early United States opposed imperialism through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine. Therefore, the answer is that the United States expressed its opposition to imperialism through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine.\nThe answer: through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine", "{1, 2, 4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the name of Theodore Roosevelt's policy of imperialism, which is a specific concept. Rules 1 and 2 are relevant because they help us understand that if there is a comparison between two concepts, we can use the antonym to infer the relationship between them. Rule 4 is relevant because it tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, which helps us identify that we are looking for a policy and not a person. Rule 7 is relevant because it tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, which means we need to look for synonyms of \"policy of imperialism\". Rule 17 is relevant because it tells us that negations are important for the answer, which means we need to look for a policy that is not opposed to imperialism. \nThe answer: There is no specific policy name mentioned in the article.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba. Therefore, the answer is the Philippines.\nThe answer: Philippines", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a \"racket\"", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us identify that the person mentioned first in the passage, Isiah Bowman, is the one we are looking for. The rule that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\" helps us identify that the sentence \"Bowman was the director of the American Geographical Society in 1914\" is in the passive voice, and therefore \"Bowman\" is the subject. \nThe answer: Isiah Bowman.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Isiah Bowman was appointed to President Wilson's inquiry in 1917.\nThe answer: 1917.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the inquiry was the idea of President Wilson and the American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference, indicating that it was not solely Wilson's idea. Additionally, the sentence structure places the mention of Wilson's name after the mention of the inquiry, indicating that there was someone else involved in the idea. \nThe answer: the American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: To build a premise that would allow for U.S authorship of a 'new world' which was to be characterized by geographical order.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Isiah Bowman was known as \"Wilson's geographer\" due to his role in President Wilson's inquiry in 1917.\nThe answer: Wilson's geographer", "{rule list} 1, 3, 4, 5, 17\nExplanation: The passage discusses how some people describe internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism. This is because one group is exerting power and control over another group, similar to how a colonizing power would exert control over a colonized people. Rules 1, 3, 4, and 5 help to clarify that imperialism and colonialism are distinct concepts from each other, and that size, shape, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles are not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 is important because it highlights that negations are important for the answer, and the question asks about what some people describe as imperialism or colonialism, indicating that not everyone may agree with this characterization. \nThe answer: internal strife between various people groups", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage distinguishes between different forms of imperialism and colonialism, including internal colonialism, which is described as the treatment of indigenous peoples during westward expansion. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because the question asks for a type of colonialism, and the passage distinguishes between different forms of imperialism and colonialism. The answer: internal colonialism.", "{rule list: 3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"12 to 15 million Africans\" were brought into the United States during the slave trade. The question uses the synonym \"brought\" for \"participation in the African slave trade.\" The irrelevant information in the passage includes the discussion of internal and external imperialism and the quote from Edward Said. \nThe answer: 12 to 15 million.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the contemporary Orient", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions the Ottoman Empire lasting until 1923, implying that it fell in that year. Additionally, the article does not mention any other event that could be interpreted as the fall of the Ottoman Empire. \nThe answer: 1923", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it compares the Ottoman Empire's power at different times. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of power and reign. Rule 16 applies because it asks for the specific person who reigned during the Ottoman Empire's height of power. \nThe answer: Suleiman the Magnificent", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that at the beginning of the 17th century, the Ottoman Empire contained 32 provinces. \nThe answer: 32", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts. Therefore, the answer is not \"Europe\" because it is a location, which is a different concept from the continents. The answer is \"North America\" because it is a continent, which is a different concept from Africa and Asia. \nThe answer: North America", "{rule list: 1, 2}\nExplanation: The question asks for the time when the Ottoman Empire was at its height, which implies a comparison of power and influence over time. Therefore, rules 1 and 2 are relevant as they deal with comparisons. Rule 1 states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. In this case, we can say that if the Ottoman Empire was at its height during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, then it was less powerful before and after his reign. Rule 2 states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X. In this case, we can say that if the Ottoman Empire was at its height during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, then he was the most powerful ruler of the empire. \nThe answer: During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th and 17th centuries.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Istanbul", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century\". Rule 4 is relevant because it reminds us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we know that Germany is a nationality and not a profession. Rule 16 is relevant because it tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the Ottoman Empire allied with Germany and not the other way around.\nThe answer: Germany", "{rule list} 1, 17, 23\nExplanation: The question asks for the event that ended Turkish imperial ambitions. Rule 1 applies because \"ending Turkish imperial ambitions\" is the opposite of \"Turkish colonial ambitions\". Rule 17 applies because the question contains the negation \"What ended\" which is important for the answer. Rule 23 applies because the sentence structure is passive. \nThe answer: The dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after World War I.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that nationality and location are different concepts (4) eliminates any answer that refers to a nationality, such as Turkish. The rule that first comes before last (16) helps to identify that the Ottoman Empire is the entity being referred to. The answer: None, as the Ottoman Empire no longer exists.", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: UMC is an acronym for United Methodist Church, which is a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination. \nThe answer: United Methodist Church", "{3, 4, 16, 19}\nExplanation: The rules selected are based on the fact that the question is asking for a definition of the United Methodist Church. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes color from other concepts that may be mentioned in the article. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes profession from nationality. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes the order of events mentioned in the article. Rule 19 is relevant because it clarifies that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession. \nThe answer: The United Methodist Church is a mainline Protestant Methodist denomination that traces its roots back to the revival movement of John and Charles Wesley in England as well as the Great Awakening in the United States. It embraces both liturgical and evangelical elements.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that the UMC was founded in 1968 by the union of two churches. This is a passive sentence, where the subject (UMC) is acted upon the verb (was founded). Therefore, we apply rules 16 and 23 to determine that the year 1968 is the answer.\nThe answer: 1968", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that the UMC was founded in 1968 by the union of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, so we need to identify who led this union. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", so we know that the Methodist Church (USA) was the first predecessor mentioned and the Evangelical United Brethren Church was the last. Rule 23 tells us that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can rephrase the question as \"By whom was the UMC founded?\" The answer is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it was founded by the leaders of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church who agreed to the union. \nThe answer: The leaders of the Methodist Church (USA) and the Evangelical United Brethren Church.", "{3, 4, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding the concept of \"theological orientation\" of the United Methodist Church. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including theology. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, which is important in understanding the church's theological orientation. Rule 5 is relevant because it distinguishes between animals and vehicles, which is not relevant to this question but helps to narrow down the relevant rules. Rule 13 is relevant because it emphasizes the importance of names in the answer. \nThe answer: Wesleyan.", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 13}\nExplanation: The rules selected ensure that we focus on the concept of \"denomination\" and avoid confusion with other concepts such as profession or location. The answer is: The United Methodist Church.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: approximately 80 million", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 16}\nExplanation: Size and shape are different concepts, so the fact that UMC is the largest denomination does not mean it is the largest in terms of physical size or shape. Profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that UMC is the largest denomination does not mean it is the largest in terms of being American. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so the fact that UMC is the largest denomination does not mean it is the largest in terms of being a type of vehicle or animal. The order of largest denomination is being compared to other denominations, so rule 16 applies. \nThe answer: mainline Protestant denomination", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: We need to find the percentage of the U.S. population that self-identifies with the United Methodist Church. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about the nationality of UMC members. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the fact that the question asks for the percentage of the population that self-identifies with UMC, not the percentage of UMC members in the population. The answer: 3.6%.", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The first sentence of the article states that the movement began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England.\nThe answer: mid-18th century", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which is in the passive voice. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to look for the agent of the action. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that \"The United Methodist Church\" is the last entity mentioned in the sentence and therefore the subject of the sentence. The answer is: \"within the Church of England\".", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the student group was called \"the Methodists\" because they were methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions, and disciplined lifestyle. This fits with rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 7, which states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph.\nThe answer: Because they were methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions, and disciplined lifestyle.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the passage, which is in the active voice and states that John and Charles Wesley went to America in 1735.\nThe answer: 1735", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that John and Charles Wesley went to America before the \"Holy Club\" disbanded. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb\", which means that the sentence \"John and Charles Wesley went to America to teach the gospel to the American Indians in the colony of Georgia\" is in the active voice. \nThe answer: colony of Georgia", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: American Indians", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the teachings emphasized by \"The Holy Club.\" Rule 3 states that concepts such as teachings are different from concepts such as age or color. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The answer is that \"The Holy Club's\" teachings emphasized salvation by God's grace, acquired through faith in Christ.", "{1, 3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The Methodists were originally part of the Church of England, but the American Revolution caused a separation from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church. \nThe answer: the American Revolution", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it says \"In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society.\" This means that Wesley appointed Thomas Coke as bishop in 1784.\nThe answer: 1784", "{16, 23, 24}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society\" is in the active voice, with Wesley as the subject and Thomas Coke as the object. Therefore, rule 16 applies to determine that Wesley came before Coke in the sentence. Additionally, the sentence structure is in the passive voice, with \"was appointed\" being the passive verb and \"Wesley\" being the subject. Therefore, rules 23 and 24 apply to determine that Wesley appointed Thomas Coke as bishop in 1784.\nThe answer: Thomas Coke", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lovely Lane Methodist Church", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Lovely Lane Methodist Church", "{rule list: 13, 14}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name and location of a church in Philadelphia.

Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that \"initially\" means before they purchased the building mentioned later in the sentence. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of location (where they met) and age (when they met). Rule 16 is relevant because it clarifies that \"initially\" comes before the later location mentioned in the sentence.\nThe answer: sail loft on Dock Street", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Methodists had not yet broken away from the Anglican Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church was not founded until 1784.\" This means that the Methodist Episcopal Church was founded in 1784, which is a passive sentence where the subject (Methodist Episcopal Church) is acted upon the verb (founded).\nThe answer: 1784", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Richard Allen and Absalom Jones were the first African Americans ordained by the Methodist Church. This information is presented in a straightforward manner and does not require any complex reasoning or inference. Therefore, rules 13 (names are equally important for the answer) and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) are the most relevant. \nThe answer: Richard Allen and Absalom Jones", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Richard Allen and Absalom Jones were licensed by St. George's Church in 1784. This is a simple statement of fact that can be extracted without any complex reasoning.\nThe answer: St. George's Church", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1784", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the date when the split occurred between the Methodist Protestant Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church.\nThe answer: 1830", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The first and fourth rules are relevant because they establish that profession and denomination are different concepts, and that a split can occur over an issue. The seventeenth rule is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: over the issue of laity having a voice and vote in the administration of the church", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In 1844, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church split into two conferences because of tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination.\" This is a clear statement of when the split occurred, using the chronological order of events (rule 16) and the passive voice (rule 23) to convey the information.\nThe answer: 1844", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: tensions over slavery and the power of bishops in the denomination.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that the United Methodist Church was created on April 23, 1968. Rule 1 applies because \"created\" implies that the United Methodist Church did not exist before that date. Rule 16 applies because the date is a specific point in time. \nThe answer: April 23, 1968.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the Evangelical United Brethren Church (represented by Bishop Reuben H. Mueller) and The Methodist Church (represented by Bishop Lloyd Christ Wicke) joined hands at the constituting General Conference in Dallas, Texas.\" This is a clear indication of a physical action taking place, which is described in an active sentence. Therefore, rules 16 and 23 apply.\nThe answer: Dallas, Texas", "{rule list: 13, 16, 20}\nExplanation: The question asks for the name of one man who joined hands and said a specific phrase. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, but since the question only asks for one name, this rule is not relevant. Rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names, so we know that the person referred to in the question is male.\nThe answer: Bishop Reuben H. Mueller or Bishop Lloyd Christ Wicke", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the United Methodist Church understands itself to be part of the \"holy catholic (or universal) church.\" The word \"catholic\" in this context does not refer to the Roman Catholic Church, but rather to the universal Christian Church. The use of \"holy\" emphasizes the church's belief in its connection to the divine. The negation rule is also relevant here, as the question asks for what church the UMC is a part of, rather than what church it is not a part of. \nThe answer: the holy catholic (or universal) church", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Book of Discipline", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The concept of the visible and invisible Church is that all true believers in every age belong to the holy Church invisible, while the United Methodist Church is a branch of the Church visible, to which all believers must be connected as it is the only institution wherein the Word of God is preached and the Sacraments are administered.\nThe answer: All true believers in every age belong to the holy Church invisible, while the United Methodist Church is a branch of the Church visible.", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between Wesley's breaking with standard practice and the reason for it. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between Wesley's profession and his nationality. Rule 17 applies because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Because of the American Revolution.", "{7, 13}\nExplanation: The passage states that Dr. Thomas Coke, already an Anglican priest, assisted Wesley in ordaining Whatcoat and Vasey as presbyters.\nThe answer: Dr. Thomas Coke", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"John Wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters, Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat.\" Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the two preachers that Wesley ordained, and the sentence provides the answer in reverse order (Whatcoat and Vasey). Rule 16 applies to determine that the first name listed (Whatcoat) comes before the second name listed (Vasey). \nThe answer: Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat", "{16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"With the formation of The United Methodist Church in 1968...\".\nThe answer: 1968", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the practices and beliefs of the United Methodist Church can be traced back to the writings of its founders, including John Wesley and Charles Wesley (Anglicans), Philip William Otterbein and Martin Boehm (United Brethren), and Jacob Albright (Evangelical Association). Therefore, we can use rule 4 to identify that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 16 to determine that the first founder mentioned is John Wesley and the second is Charles Wesley.\nThe answer: John Wesley and Charles Wesley", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for a person who led a team in 1968. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore the fact that the person is a theologian. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that Albert C. Outler is the person being referred to. \nThe answer: Albert C. Outler", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying a person's profession. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so nationality is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that Albert C. Outler is a person's name and not a location. \nThe answer: Albert C. Outler", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"grace that goes before us\" is a comparative phrase. Rule 3 applies because \"grace\" and \"power\" are different concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a definition of a term. \nThe answer: Prevenient grace", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that prevenient grace is the power that enables us to love and motivates us to seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. The use of \"enables\" indicates a positive aspect, so we do not need to consider rule 8. The question asks for the specific term used in the passage, so we do not need to consider rule 7. The answer is: prevenient grace.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because \"prevenient grace\" is being compared to other types of grace. Rule 3 applies because \"prevenient grace\" is a concept that is being defined. \nThe answer: the grace that \"goes before\" us, given to all people, that enables us to love and seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ, and turns us from our sin-corrupted human will to the loving will of the Father.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The concept of being \"tainted by sin\" is mentioned in the passage, which is a negation of being pure or free from sin. Therefore, rule 3 applies. Additionally, the question uses the word \"allow\" which implies permission, and the passage states that prevenient grace enables people to make a free choice to accept or reject God's salvation. This implies that without prevenient grace, they would not have the ability to make that choice, which is a negation. Therefore, rule 8 applies. Finally, the question contains the negation \"tainted by\", which is important for understanding the answer. Therefore, rule 17 applies. \nThe answer: sin", "{1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the type of grace that is received by faith and trust in God. Rule 1 applies because it establishes that if A is received more than B, then B is received less than A. Rule 2 applies because it establishes that if A is received and B is somewhat received, then A is received most and B is received least. Rule 17 applies because the question is asking for the grace that is received, and negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Justifying Grace or Accepting Grace", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is describing the concept of justifying grace, which is a theological concept and not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles. Rule 3 applies to differentiate between these concepts. Rule 9 applies because the answer describes how justifying grace cancels guilt and empowers the believer, which is a comparison of two opposite concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what cancels guilt and empowers the believer, which is a negation of the opposite concept of guilt and powerlessness. \nThe answer: justifying grace", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: Profession and religion are different concepts, and synonyms may be used in the question. \"Accepting Grace\" is a synonym for \"Justifying Grace\". \nThe answer: conversion, \"accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior,\" or being \"born again\"", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: Being \"born again\" is another name for justifying grace or conversion.\nThe answer: justifying grace or conversion", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the New Birth", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the definition of Sanctifying Grace includes the concept of \"Christian Perfection,\" implying that it is a higher level of grace than other forms. Rule 3 applies because the definition distinguishes Sanctifying Grace from other types of grace based on its specific purpose and effects. \nThe answer: the grace of God which sustains believers in the journey toward Christian Perfection", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Sanctifying grace is the grace of God that sustains believers in their journey towards Christian Perfection, enabling them to respond to God by leading a Spirit-filled and Christ-like life aimed towards love. It is a genuine love of God and our neighbors as ourselves. This answer is found in the first sentence of the passage and is a direct answer to the question. The relevant rules are 1 and 2 because they help to clarify the meaning of \"grace of God\" and \"Christian Perfection,\" and rule 17 because it emphasizes the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Sanctifying Grace", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Christian Perfection is described as a state in which a person cannot fall into sin, which implies that they are more perfect than someone who can still sin. Rule 3 applies because Christian Perfection is a concept, not a physical attribute like size or shape. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a definition, and \"what is\" indicates that the answer should be a positive statement. \nThe answer: a state in which a person cannot fall into sin", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for a definition of \"a genuine love of God with heart, soul, and mind.\" Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"love\" and \"mind\" are different, so we cannot assume that they are interchangeable. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can infer that a genuine love of God with heart, soul, and mind is a love that is not superficial or limited to one aspect of a person, but rather a deep and all-encompassing love that involves the entirety of one's being. \nThe answer: A deep and all-encompassing love of God that involves the entirety of one's being.", "{1, 3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The answer involves a characterization of Wesleyan theology, which is a concept. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 apply to ensure that the answer is not confused with a profession or nationality. Additionally, the question uses the phrase \"has been characterized as,\" indicating that the answer is a description or attribute of Wesleyan theology, which is a comparison. Therefore, rule 1 applies. Finally, the question uses the phrase \"with an emphasis on,\" indicating that the answer involves a focus or priority. Therefore, rule 7 applies.\nThe answer: Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a definition, which falls under the category of \"different concepts\" (rule 3). The question also contains the phrase \"primary authority,\" which is a negation (rule 17). \nThe answer: prima scriptura", "{4, 17, 19}\nExplanation: Profession and nationality are different concepts (4), negations are important for the answer (17), and a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession (19).\nThe answer: The United Methodist Church", "{3, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"according to The Book of Discipline, United Methodist theology is at once 'catholic, evangelical, and reformed.'\" This statement is a direct quote from a source and therefore should be considered important for the answer. Additionally, the passage mentions the UMC's stance on various theological matters, but this information is not directly relevant to the question. Finally, the order of the words \"catholic, evangelical, and reformed\" is important for the answer, so rule 16 should be applied to ensure that the answer is \"catholic, evangelical, and reformed\" and not \"evangelical, reformed, and catholic\" or some other permutation. \nThe answer: \"catholic, evangelical, and reformed\"", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2008", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the UMC upholds the sanctity of human life for both the child and the mother, but is also pro-choice and supports the work of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. Therefore, both pro-life and pro-choice stances are present. Negation is important in this question because it asks whether the UMC is one or the other, not whether it has elements of both. \nThe answer: The UMC is both pro-life and pro-choice.", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage \"Still, the denomination is pro-choice and also 'was a founding member of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice...[and] 2008 General Conference [went] on record in support of the work of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice'.\" \nThe answer: Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that two official bodies of the United Methodist Church are part of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice's governing coalition. \nThe answer: The General Board of Church and Society and the United Methodist Women.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to women who have made the choice to have an abortion. The rule 3 is important because it distinguishes between the concept of \"women\" and the concept of \"choice\". The rule 4 is important because it distinguishes between the concept of \"religion\" and the concept of \"nationality\". The rule 17 is important because it highlights the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: women who have had an abortion", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The church believes that both the life and well-being of the mother are sacred and must be respected. This includes cases where an unacceptable pregnancy may cause devastating damage to the mother. However, the church also recognizes that there may be tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion. Therefore, the church emphasizes the need to be in supportive ministry with all women, regardless of their choice. \nThe answer: the mother", "{4, 19}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the taskforce cannot be a nationality. The rule 19 states that a person's gender is irrelevant to their profession, so the taskforce can be identified as \"pro-life\" without specifying the gender of its members. \nThe answer: Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality (TUMAS)", "{rule list: 17, 18}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific year in which an event occurred. The word \"attempt\" implies that the action was not successful. The question also contains a synonym for \"membership\" with \"UMC.\" Therefore, rules 17 and 18, which state that negations and negations in the question are important for the answer, are relevant.\nThe answer: 2012", "{16, 21}\nExplanation: We use rule 16 to determine that \"Rev. Paul T. Stallsworth\" is the last name mentioned in the passage and therefore the president of TUMAS. We use rule 21 to determine that \"he\" refers to \"Rev. Paul T. Stallsworth\".\nThe answer: Rev. Paul T. Stallsworth", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that historically, the Methodist Church has supported the temperance movement, which is a movement advocating for abstinence from alcohol. Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that supporting the temperance movement means advocating for abstinence from alcohol. Rule 4 applies because it distinguishes between profession (Methodist Church) and movement (temperance movement). Rule 17 applies because the question asks for a negation (which movement has the Methodist Church supported?). \nThe answer: temperance movement", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2011 and 2012", "{rule list: 3, 11}\nExplanation: The name of the sermon is important for the answer, and contractions in the question are irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: \"The Use of Money\"", "{rule list: 3, 9}\nExplanation: The article states that the United Methodist Church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of Holy Communion, which is a specific detail that answers the question.\nThe answer: unfermented grape juice", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The UMC condemns capital punishment, as stated in the article.\nThe answer: capital punishment", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the passage where it states that \"The United Methodist Church also believes that Jesus explicitly repudiated the lex talionis in Matthew 5:38-39 and abolished the death penalty in John 8:7.\" Therefore, we need to consider rule 3 to understand that \"Matthew 5:38-39\" and \"John 8:7\" are different concepts. Rule 8 is also relevant because it tells us that if Jesus abolished the death penalty, then the opposite is true for the death penalty. Finally, rule 17 is important because it tells us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: John 8:7", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the UMC believes that Jesus explicitly repudiated the lex talionis in Matthew 5:38-39. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including religious concepts like the lex talionis. Rule 8 is relevant because it deals with comparisons and antonyms, which is important for understanding the meaning of \"repudiated.\" Rule 17 is relevant because it deals with negations, which is important for understanding the UMC's stance on capital punishment. \nThe answer: Matthew 5:38-39", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: The United Methodist Church as a whole condemns capital punishment, but it is the General Conference that specifically calls for its bishops to uphold opposition to it.\nThe answer: General Conference", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The UMC prohibits the celebration of same-sex unions.\nThe answer: same-sex unions", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1999", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2016", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Connectional Table", "{4, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the community that many organizations have called for broader acceptance of. Rule 4 tells us that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"LGBT community\" in the passage. Rule 17 tells us that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the use of \"not\" in the passage. The answer is the \"LGBT community\".", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that many conferences have voted in favor of same-gender marriages with resolutions. The use of the phrase \"in favor of\" indicates a positive stance towards same-gender marriages. The rules of 3 and 7 help to clarify that \"same-gender marriages\" refers to marriages between individuals of the same gender, and that \"voting in favor of\" means supporting or approving. \nThe answer: same-gender marriages", "{1, 12, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: We need to identify the year in which Rose Mary Denman was defrocked for living with a same-sex partner. The passage provides this information directly, so we only need to focus on relevant details and ignore irrelevant ones. \nThe answer: 1987", "{rule list: 10, 18}\nExplanation: Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer, and Rule 18 states that negations in the question are important for the answer. The question asks for the year in which Irene Elizabeth Stroud was convicted, so we need to look for the year in the passage. The answer is \"2005\".\nThe answer: 2005", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article discusses the United Methodist Church and its policies regarding LGBTQ individuals. The answer to the question is the Baltimore-Washington Conference of the UMC.\nThe answer: Baltimore-Washington Conference of the UMC", "{rule list: 4, 17}\nExplanation: The UMC's opposition is based on religious beliefs, which fall under the category of \"values and beliefs\" (rule 4). The use of the word \"oppose\" indicates a negation, which is important for the answer (rule 17).\nThe answer: conscription", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The church states that neither the way of military action nor the way of inaction is always righteous before God.\nThe answer: military action or inaction", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because opposing conscription means being against mandatory military service. Rule 3 applies because \"oppose\" and \"conscientiously oppose\" are synonyms. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for what the Church supports, not what it opposes. \nThe answer: all war, or any particular war, and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription.", "{rule list: 1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: The UMC rejects war as an instrument of national foreign policy and insists that the first moral duty of all nations is to resolve disputes by peaceful means. The negation in the question is important, as it asks what war is incompatible with, not what the UMC is incompatible with. Therefore, we use rule 17 to determine that \"incompatible\" is a negation and rule 1 to determine that if war is incompatible with Christ's message and teachings, then Christ's message and teachings are incompatible with war.\nThe answer: Christ's message and teachings", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"war\" is a different concept from \"Christ's message and teachings\" (rule 3) is relevant because it clarifies what the Church is rejecting war as an instrument of. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" (rule 17) is also relevant because the question asks for what the Church rejects war as an instrument of. \nThe answer: national foreign policy", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The UMC endorses general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, which means the reduction and control of the manufacture, sale, and deployment of armaments. This is in line with rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 17, which states that negations are important for the answer.\nThe answer: general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The Sexual Ethics Task Force of The United Methodist Church states that 'Research shows it [pornography] is not an 'innocent activity.' It is harmful and is generally addictive.\" This directly answers the question. \nThe answer: The Sexual Ethics Task Force of The United Methodist Church.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" is relevant because the question asks about what pornography is \"about,\" which implies a negative connotation. The answer is \"violence, degradation, exploitation, and coercion.\" \n\nThe answer: violence, degradation, exploitation, and coercion.", "{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is \"girls and women.\" Rule 1 applies because \"altered perceptions\" implies a comparison to a normal perception. Rule 3 applies because \"perceptions\" is a different concept from \"relationships.\" Rule 4 applies because \"persons\" is a different concept from \"girls and women.\" Rule 5 applies because \"persons\" is a different concept from \"animals.\" Rule 6 applies because \"girls and women\" is a different concept from \"vehicles.\" Rule 7 applies because \"altered\" is a synonym of \"changed.\" Rule 8 applies because \"addicted\" implies a comparison to a non-addicted state. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a negation. \nThe answer: girls and women.", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The UMC supports federal funding for research on embryos created for IVF that remain after the procreative efforts have ceased, if the embryos were provided for research instead of being destroyed, were not obtained by sale, and those donating had given prior informed consent for the research purposes. The UMC opposes the creation of embryos for the sake of research. Therefore, the answer is: embryos created for IVF that remain after the procreative efforts have ceased.", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the UMC supports research on stem cells retrieved from umbilical cords and adult stem cells. The rules applied are: 3 (distinguishing between different concepts), 4 (distinguishing between profession and nationality), 5 (distinguishing between animals and vehicles), 6 (distinguishing between animals and vehicles), 7 (synonyms in the question may be relevant), 8 (antonyms), 9 (antonyms), 12 (irrelevant passages), and 17 (negations). \nThe answer: stem cells retrieved from umbilical cords", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: research", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that John Wesley provided a revised version of The Book of Common Prayer when the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England. This is a passive sentence, so we need to reverse the order of the subject and object to get an active sentence: \"John Wesley provided a revised version of The Book of Common Prayer when the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England.\" This sentence follows rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and rule 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb). \nThe answer: John Wesley provided a revised version of The Book of Common Prayer when the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that John Wesley provided a revised version of The Book of Common Prayer called the Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America. Therefore, we need to identify the book that was revised by Wesley. Rule 13 tells us that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the names mentioned in the passage. Rule 16 tells us that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we know that The Book of Common Prayer comes before the Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America. \nThe answer: The Book of Common Prayer", "{4, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that the clergy in question are from the United Methodist Church in Africa is relevant information. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that exorcism is an occasional practice by some clergy in the UMC in Africa implies that it is not a common practice in other regions. \nThe answer: Africa", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Liturgies are derived from a book. This implies that there is a source for these liturgies. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in the question. Therefore, the answer is \"The Anglican tradition's Book of Common Prayer.\"", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts from the laying on of hands. Animals and vehicles are different concepts from the laying on of hands. \nThe answer: anointing with oil", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Methodist institutions", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that William Booth is the founder of the Salvation Army is not affected by his nationality. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so the fact that William Booth is mentioned in the passage is relevant.\nThe answer: William Booth", "{rule list: 4, 13, 20}\nExplanation: John Wesley is a name and therefore equally important for the answer (rule 13). The question asks for a person's identity, which is a profession (rule 4). Gender is irrelevant to profession (rule 19), but the question uses the pronoun \"who,\" which refers to a person, and therefore, the gender rules apply (rule 20).\nThe answer: John Wesley", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The United Methodist Church", "{3, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The highest level is called the General Conference and is the only organization which may speak officially for the church.\" This is a clear statement that the General Conference is the only organization with the authority to speak officially for the church, and this is supported by rules 3 (different concepts) and 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts) as well as the fact that the article emphasizes this point. \nThe answer: The General Conference", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that different concepts, such as books and conferences, cannot be compared. Rule 16 states that \"after\" refers to a time later than the one mentioned. Therefore, the answer is: The Book of Discipline.", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the United Methodist Church is organized into conferences and that the highest level is called the General Conference, which is the only organization that may speak officially for the church. Rule 1 applies because \"highest level\" implies a comparison with other levels. Rule 4 applies because \"organization\" and \"officially\" are different concepts. Rule 13 applies because \"highest level\" is a name and therefore important for the answer.\nThe answer: General Conference", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The General Conference meets every four years (quadrennium).\" This means that the General Conference meets once every four years.\nThe answer: every four years", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about what \"divided\" means in this context. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" helps us understand that the United States is the first entity mentioned and the number of jurisdictions is the last. \nThe answer: five", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Outside the United States the church is divided into seven central conferences.\" \nThe answer: seven", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the main purpose of the jurisdictions and central conferences is to elect and appoint bishops, who serve as the chief administrators of the church. This aligns with rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that the answer to a question about purpose or function is typically the main goal or objective of the entity in question.\nThe answer: to elect and appoint bishops", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that bishops are the chief administrators of the church. This falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first.\nThe answer: bishops", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Episcopal Areas", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Mission Council (usually consisting of church bishops)", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the Mission Council usually consists of church bishops.\nThe answer: church bishops", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Mission Council approved a 99-year lease of 36 acres at Southern Methodist University for the George W. Bush Presidential Library.\nThe answer: 36 acres", "{3, 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the Mission Council approved a 99-year lease of 36 acres at Southern Methodist University for the George W. Bush Presidential Library. The question asks why the 36 acres were leased. The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it can be inferred that the lease was approved for the purpose of building the George W. Bush Presidential Library. \nThe answer: for the George W. Bush Presidential Library.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the Mission Council approved a 99-year lease for the George W. Bush Presidential Library at Southern Methodist University. The location of the library is therefore irrelevant to the answer.\nThe answer: Southern Methodist University", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the Judicial Council consists of \"nine members\".\nThe answer: nine", "{1, 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the highest court in the United Methodist denomination. Rule 1 is relevant because it clarifies that if A is the highest court, then B is the opposite of the highest court. Rule 4 is relevant because it clarifies that profession and nationality are different concepts, which helps to avoid confusion with other types of courts. Rule 13 is relevant because it clarifies that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Judicial Council", "{2, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 2, which states that if A has a term of X years, then the term of B is also X years if B is in the same position as A, and rule 16, which states that \"term\" refers to the length of time someone holds a position. Therefore, the answer is: eight years.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rule is rule 16, which states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" The passage states that \"The Council meets twice a year,\" indicating that the number of times the Council meets is two.\nThe answer: twice a year", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 16 and 22. Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\", which means that the information about the Council meeting twice a year is not relevant to the answer. Rule 22 establishes that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last, but since there are only two entities mentioned in the passage, this rule is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is: The Council meets at various locations throughout the world.", "{1, 3, 13}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that \"basic unit of organization\" is a comparative concept. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that \"basic unit of organization\" is not related to size, shape, age, or color. Rule 13 applies because it clarifies that names are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Annual Conference", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those options. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that the term \"Annual Conference\" refers to the geographical area it covers. \nThe answer: the geographical area it covers", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that the answer is \"the United Methodist Church.\" The rule that \"clergy are members of their Annual Conference rather than of any local congregation\" indicates that the answer is \"Annual Conference.\"\nThe answer: Annual Conference", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that \"The Book of Discipline is the guidebook for local churches and pastors.\" Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between profession and nationality, and in this case, \"local churches and pastors\" are professions. Rule 13 is also relevant because it emphasizes that names are equally important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Book of Discipline", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"All UM churches must have a board of trustees with at least three members and no more than nine members.\" Rule 3 tells us that size is a different concept, so we can focus on the number of members. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the minimum number of members is three.\nThe answer: 3", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"All UM churches must have a board of trustees with at least three members and no more than nine members.\" Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other characteristics, and rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can infer that the greatest number of members a board of trustees can have is nine.\nThe answer: 9", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for a specific term used in the article to describe a meeting. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can assume that the term we are looking for is mentioned after any other committees or groups mentioned in the passage. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" so we can assume that the term we are looking for is an active sentence. \nThe answer: church conference", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we can infer that the committee with the exclusive power to set pastors' salaries is the church conference. \nThe answer: church conference", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the United Methodist Church established and is affiliated with around one hundred colleges and universities in the United States. \nThe answer: around one hundred", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the United Methodist Church operates \"three hundred sixty schools and institutions overseas.\" The number is a specific quantity, so rule 3 applies to ensure that size is not confused with other concepts. Rule 16 applies to ensure that the answer is presented in a clear and concise manner.\nThe answer: 360", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The question is asking about a group that the schools established by the UMC belong to. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts. Therefore, the answer cannot be related to any of these concepts. The only relevant information in the passage is that the UMC is affiliated with around one hundred colleges and universities in the United States, and most are members of the International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities. Therefore, the answer is: International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: John Wesley", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Profession and nationality are different concepts, but the question is about profession, so rule 4 is relevant. Rule 16 is also relevant because it specifies that \"serve as pastors\" comes before \"in local congregations.\" \nThe answer: pastors", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. The answer can be found by applying the rules that shape and size are different concepts, and that in a list, first comes before last. The answer is: their Annual Conference Order of Elders.", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article explains that deacons in full connection are members of their Annual Conference Order of Deacons. This indicates that \"full connection\" is important, which is explained in rule 3 as a different concept from just \"deacons.\" Rule 4 is also relevant as it emphasizes that profession and nationality are different concepts, and being a member of the Order of Deacons is a professional affiliation rather than a nationality. Finally, rule 16 is important as it clarifies that \"each deacon\" comes after \"elders in full connection\" in the sentence, indicating that \"each deacon\" is a separate group from the elders. \nThe answer: their Annual Conference Order of Deacons.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Annual Conference Cabinet", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: The article states that \"an appointment is made one year at a time,\" but it is also common for appointments to be continued for multiple years. This means that clergy appointments are made annually, but can be continued for longer periods of time. \nThe answer: one year at a time", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Until the bishop has read the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference, no appointments are officially fixed\" is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject (the appointments) is being acted upon by the verb (being officially fixed) and that the bishop reading them is the agent of the action. This means that the appointments become officially fixed when the bishop reads them at the session of the Annual Conference.\nThe answer: when the bishop reads the appointments at the session of the Annual Conference", "{1, 4, 13, 19}\nExplanation: This question is asking for a specific role within the church, which is the Elder. According to the passage, Elders are called by God, affirmed by the church, and ordained by a bishop. This answer is not affected by any of the other rules. \nThe answer: Elders", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that elders are affirmed by the church and ordained by a bishop, indicating that the church and its leaders are responsible for appointing elders. Additionally, the article mentions that elders may be appointed to other valid extension ministries of the church. \nThe answer: the church and its leaders", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 2-3 years", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that profession and nationality are different concepts, and that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, it can be inferred that Elders may be assigned by bishops. \nThe answer: bishops", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The rule states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" In the passage, it is stated that deacons serve a term of 2-3 years as provisional deacons prior to their ordination. Therefore, the answer is 2-3 years.\nThe answer: 2-3 years", "{1, 2, 4, 13}\nExplanation: Deacons are ordained by a bishop to servant leadership within the church and give leadership, preach the Word, conduct marriages, bury the dead, and aid the church in embodying its mission within the world. Therefore, the answer is deacons. \nThe answer: Deacons", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Deacons are ordained to ministries of word, service, compassion, and justice and assist elders in the sacraments of Holy Communion and Baptism.\nThe answer: Deacons", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Deacons may be granted sacramental authority if they are appointed as the pastor in a local church. This means that they are given the authority to perform sacraments such as Holy Communion and Baptism. \nThe answer: sacramental authority", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the passage, which is in the active voice and states that the ordination order of transitional deacon was abolished at the 1996 General Conference.\nThe answer: 1996", "{1, 2, 4}\nExplanation: The answer is a title for a seminary graduate who serves a two-three-year term in full-time appointment after being commissioned. Rule 1 applies because \"provisional elder/deacon\" is more specific than \"seminary graduate.\" Rule 2 applies because \"provisional elder\" is the most specific title, while \"provisional deacon\" is the least specific. Rule 4 applies because profession and title are different concepts. \nThe answer: provisional elder", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that at the 1996 General Conference, the ordination order of transitional deacon was abolished, which led to the creation of new orders known as \"provisional elder\" or \"provisional deacon.\" This means that the abolition of the transitional deacon order provided for the creation of the new orders. \nThe answer: abolition of the transitional deacon order", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rules that apply are 3 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 4 (animals and vehicles are different concepts), and 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first). These rules are relevant because they help us identify the specific information we need to answer the question. The answer: Licensed Local Pastor.", "{3, 16, 19}\nExplanation: The article explains that Local Pastors are appointed by a bishop to a ministry of Word, Sacrament, Order and Service within the church and are given the authority to preach the Word of God, administer the sacraments of the church, to provide care and counseling, and to order the life of the church for ministry and mission, but are not ordained. They have the authority of a pastor only within the context and during the time of the appointment. \nThe answer: Local Pastors", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that local pastors are required to attend and pass an approved five-year course of study at an approved United Methodist seminary or course of study school. This means that they must attend a five-year course of study at an approved seminary. \nThe answer: 5 years", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Associate Membership", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"Baptized Members are those who have been baptized as an infant or child, but who have not subsequently professed their own faith.\" This means that members who have been baptized as an infant or child but have not made a personal profession of faith are considered Baptized Members.\nThe answer: Baptized Members", "{1, 2}\nExplanation: Baptized Members become Professing Members through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith.", "{3, 15}\nExplanation: Becoming a Professing Member can be achieved through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith, or through transfer from another Christian denomination.\nThe answer: Through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith, or through transfer from another Christian denomination.", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Baptism is a sacrament in the UMC, while confirmation and profession of faith are not sacraments. \nThe answer: Baptism", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Students learn about the Church and the Methodist-Christian theological tradition in confirmation and membership preparation classes.\nThe answer: In confirmation and membership preparation classes.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church directs the local church to offer membership preparation or confirmation classes to all people, including adults.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Church and the Methodist-Christian theological tradition", "{3, 4, 5, 6}\nExplanation: The rules state that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, as are profession and nationality, and animals and vehicles. Therefore, \"local church\" and \"certified\" cannot be related to any of these concepts. The only relevant rule is that different categories or types of something are different concepts. Therefore, \"local church\" and \"certified\" are two types of \"lay servant.\"\nThe answer: Lay servant", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage explains that to be recognized as a local church lay servant, one must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, and complete the basic course for lay servant. Each year they must reapply, reporting how they have served and continued to learn during that year. Therefore, rules 3 and 16 are relevant. \nThe answer: They must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, and complete the basic course for lay servant.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" and \"first comes before last and last comes after first.\" The passage explains that to be recognized as a local church lay servant, they must be recommended by their pastor and Church Council or Charge Conference, and complete the basic course for lay servant. Each year they must reapply, reporting how they have served and continued to learn during that year. Therefore, local lay servants must reapply annually.\nThe answer: annually", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that to be recognized as a local church lay servant, one must complete the basic course for lay servant. Therefore, only one course is required.\nThe answer: one", "{rule list: 3, 4}\nExplanation: The rule that \"religion\" and \"denomination\" are different concepts (rule 4) helps to clarify that the United Methodist Church is a specific denomination within the broader Christian Church tradition (rule 3). \nThe answer: United Methodist Church", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: observer status", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The concept of false ecumenism blurs theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity.\nThe answer: the blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity.", "{rule list: 13, 16}\nExplanation: Names and dates are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: 2000", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time when the UMC entered into full communion with several churches. Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" which means that the order of the churches listed in the passage matters. Rule 23 states that \"in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb,\" which means that we need to look for a passive sentence that indicates when the UMC entered into full communion. The answer is \"In May 2012, The United Methodist Church entered into full communion with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, African Union Methodist Protestant Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church.\" \nThe answer: May 2012", "{1, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which states that the UMC has been exploring a possible merger with three historically African-American Methodist denominations since 1985. The relevant rules are 1 (to understand that \"since 1985\" means \"starting from 1985 and continuing until now\") and 17 (to understand that the question is asking for the year when the exploration started). \nThe answer: 1985", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"At the time of its formation, the UMC had about 11 million members.\" This means that the UMC had 11 million members when it was first formed.\nThe answer: About 11 million.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 3, which states that size and number are different concepts, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The passage states that at the time of its formation, the UMC had nearly 42,000 congregations.\nThe answer: Nearly 42,000.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage provides information about the membership of the United Methodist Church over time and in different regions. The relevant information is that in 2005, there were about 8 million members in over 34,000 congregations. The rule about size (rule 3) is relevant because it clarifies that the number of members is a different concept from the number of congregations. The rule about first and last (rule 16) is relevant because it helps to identify which year's membership number is being referred to. \nThe answer: 8 million", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that in 2005, there were \"over 34,000 congregations\" in the UMC.\nThe answer: over 34,000", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Size and location are different concepts, and \"largest\" refers to size. The passage states that Texas has the largest number of members.\nThe answer: Texas", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million\". \nThe answer: 11.4 million", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size and location are different concepts, so we cannot assume that the total UMC membership includes only the U.S. population. However, the passage explicitly states that \"about 7.9 million\" of the total UMC membership was in the U.S. at the opening of the 2008 General Conference, so that is the answer.\nThe answer: about 7.9 million", "{3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: Size and nationality are different concepts, and first comes before last. \nThe answer: 3.5 million", "{4, 7}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the UMC is a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium, which seeks to reconceive and promote Biblical holiness in today's Church. Rule 4 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including religious groups and their beliefs. Rule 7 is relevant because it allows for synonyms to be used in the question, such as \"promote\" instead of \"advance\". \nThe answer: Wesleyan Holiness Consortium", "{4, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that profession and nationality are different concepts is not relevant to this question. However, the rule that names are equally important for the answer is relevant because the question asks for the name of a group. The answer is the World Methodist Council. \nThe answer: The World Methodist Council.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: July 18, 2006", "{rule list: 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific piece of information - the time period of the French and Indian War. Rules 10 and 12 indicate that typos and irrelevant information can be ignored, and Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. The article provides the answer in the first sentence: \"The French and Indian War (1754\u20131763) was the North American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War.\" \nThe answer: 1754-1763", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The French colonies of North America and the British colonies of North America fought in the French and Indian War.\nThe answer: The colonies of British America and New France, with support from Great Britain, France, and Native American allies.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, which is less than the 2 million in the British North American colonies. Rule 3 applies because population size is a different concept from nationality. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a comparison between two groups. \nThe answer: Roughly 60,000 European settlers.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies.\" This means that the British North American colonies had a population of 2 million people.\nThe answer: 2 million", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that the war was fought primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from Virginia in the South to Nova Scotia in the North. This indicates that the war was fought along the borders of these territories. Additionally, the article mentions the Battle of Jumonville Glen, which took place in present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This provides a specific location where the war was fought.\nThe answer: along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from Virginia in the South to Nova Scotia in the North, and specifically at the site of the French Fort Duquesne and present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24}\nExplanation: The question asks for the cause of the war, which is provided in the passage as a dispute over control of the Forks of the Ohio and the French Fort Duquesne. The Battle of Jumonville Glen was a violent incident that occurred during this dispute. \nThe answer: A dispute over control of the Forks of the Ohio and the French Fort Duquesne.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that the subject (the dispute) was acted upon by the verb (erupted into violence). Therefore, the answer is May 1754.\nThe answer: May 1754", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific time when colonial governors met with General Edward Braddock about attacking the French. This is a straightforward question that requires identifying the relevant information in the passage. Rule 16 helps to determine the order of events, and rule 23 helps to identify the passive voice in the sentence. \nThe answer: In 1755.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Braddock's initial effort was a disaster, meaning it was not successful. According to rule 1, if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, \"disaster\" is the antonym of \"successful\", so Braddock's effort was not successful, or a disaster.\nThe answer: Braddock's initial effort was a disaster.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"In 1755, the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour.\" This is a simple active sentence where the subject (British) performs the action (captured) on the object (Fort Beaus\u00e9jour). Rule 16 establishes that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that Fort Beaus\u00e9jour is the answer. Rule 23 reminds us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb. \nThe answer: Fort Beaus\u00e9jour", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The passage does not provide information about any specific order made by the British of the French.", "{1, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies.\" This indicates that a person, William Pitt, increased British military resources in colonies. Therefore, rules 1, 4, and 16 are relevant. \nThe answer: William Pitt", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that \"France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces it had in New France.\" This implies that France was not placing significant resources in North America.\nThe answer: not significant resources", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The article states that \"France concentrated its forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theatre of the war.\" This indicates that France was focusing its efforts in Europe. The relevant rules are 3 (location is important for the answer) and 17 (negations are important for the answer). \nThe answer: Europe", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the location of a British defeat in Canada. Rule 3 states that location is important for the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The passage states that the British were defeated at Sainte Foy in Quebec, so the answer is Quebec. \nThe answer: Quebec", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The article states that \"France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain.\" This means that Great Britain gained control of the territory that was previously controlled by France and located to the east of the Mississippi River. Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: territory east of the Mississippi", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: France ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans) to Spain.\nThe answer: French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans)", "{rule list: 2, 3, 4, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the significance of the British win. Rule 2 applies because the article mentions that France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain and ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain. This means that Great Britain gained significant territory in North America. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the significance of the win, not the size or shape of the territory gained. Rule 4 applies because the question asks for the significance of the win, not the nationality of the parties involved. Rule 16 applies because the article mentions that the outcome was significant in a century of Anglo-French conflict, implying that the British win was a major turning point in this conflict. \n\nThe answer: The British win was significant because it resulted in Great Britain gaining significant territory in North America and confirmed Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America, marking a major turning point in a century of Anglo-French conflict.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, so the question is asking for the specific time period of that war. The relevant rules are 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) and 23 (in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb). The answer is: in the 1740s.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The traditional name \"French and Indian War\" obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. This confusion arises from the use of a name that does not accurately reflect the nature of the conflict. \nThe answer: The name \"French and Indian War\" is confusing because it does not accurately reflect the nature of the conflict.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the definition of the Seven Years' War, which is mentioned in the passage as a larger conflict between France and Great Britain. Rules 3 and 8 are relevant because they remind us that size and names are different concepts, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Rule 17 is relevant because it reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: The Seven Years' War was a larger conflict between France and Great Britain.", "{3, 7, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the conflict is known by multiple names, including King George's War, French and Indian War, Seven Years' War, Fourth Intercolonial War, and Great War for the Empire. The question specifically asks for other alternative names, so the answer is Fourth Intercolonial War and Great War for the Empire. \nThe answer: Fourth Intercolonial War and Great War for the Empire.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Seven Years' War refers to events in Europe from 1756 to 1763, but the fighting between the two colonial powers in North America was largely concluded in six years, from 1754 to 1760. \nThe answer: 1756 to 1763 (for Europe), 1754 to 1760 (for North America)", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article explains that the Seven Years' War lasted from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763 in Europe. However, the fighting between the two colonial powers in North America was largely concluded in six years, from 1754 to 1760. Therefore, the answer is six years. \nThe answer: 6 years", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that the capture of Montreal occurred in 1760, which is the year mentioned in the sentence.\nThe answer: 1760", "{rule list: 16, 22}\nExplanation: The passage states that the fighting between the two colonial powers in North America was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760. Therefore, the answer is the Battle of Jumonville Glen.\nThe answer: Battle of Jumonville Glen", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: French population in North America numbered about 75,000.", "{3, 8, 12, 13}\nExplanation: The rule that \"locations are equally important for the answer\" means that the answer must include specific locations mentioned in the article. The rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" means that we must consider the negation in the question (\"where were they not settled?\"). The rule that \"names are equally important for the answer\" and \"some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer\" mean that we can ignore specific names and focus on the general location information. The answer: New England (not settled in New Orleans, Biloxi, Mobile, or the Illinois Country).", "{rule list: 3, 12}\nExplanation: French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds, doing business with local tribes and often marrying Indian women.\nThe answer: St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that British settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1.\nThe answer: 20 to 1.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that British settlers lived along the eastern coast of the continent, from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north, to Georgia in the south. It also states that many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west. Therefore, we can infer that British settlers lived primarily along the eastern coast, but also had settlements growing into the interior and land claims extending to the west. \nThe answer: along the eastern coast of the continent, from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north, to Georgia in the south.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the population centers were along the coast, but the settlements were growing into the interior. This means that the populations were centered along the eastern coast of the continent. Additionally, rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we can infer that the colonies mentioned first (Nova Scotia and Newfoundland) were among the population centers.\nThe answer: along the eastern coast of the continent", "{3, 8, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 8 (antonyms), 12 (irrelevant passages), and 17 (negations). The question asks for the groups that controlled land between the French and British, so we need to identify the native tribes mentioned in the passage. The passage states that the Mi'kmaq and Abenaki controlled parts of Nova Scotia, Acadia, and eastern Canada, as well as present-day Maine. The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of present-day Upstate New York and the Ohio Country, but also included Algonquian-speaking populations and Iroquoian-speaking Mingo who were formally under Iroquois rule. Therefore, the answer is native tribes, specifically the Mi'kmaq, Abenaki, Iroquois Confederation, Delaware, Shawnee, and Mingo.", "{1, 3, 7, 13}\nExplanation: The question asks for the specific tribes involved in Father Le Loutre's War, so rule 3 (color, shape, age, and profession are different concepts) and rule 13 (names are equally important for the answer) are relevant. Rule 1 (if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A) is also relevant because the passage mentions that the Mi'kmaq and Abenaki were \"engaged\" in the war, indicating their involvement was more significant than other tribes. \nThe answer: Mi'kmaq and Abenaki.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The rule of \"locations are equally important for the answer\" applies here, as the question is asking about a specific location mentioned in the article. The rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" also applies, as the article mentions Upstate New York before the Ohio Country.\nThe answer: Upstate New York and the Ohio Country.", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that some native tribes were formally under Iroquois rule and limited by them in authority to make agreements. This implies that some native tribes lived under the rule of other tribes or groups. \nThe answer: Some native tribes lived under Iroquois rule.", "{3, 4, 7}\nExplanation: The rule that \"languages are different concepts\" (3) is relevant because it distinguishes between the Siouan-speaking tribes and the Muskogee-speaking and Iroquoian-speaking tribes mentioned in the passage. The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" (4) is not relevant. The rule that \"questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph\" (7) is relevant because \"Siouan-speaking\" is a synonym for the tribes being asked about. \nThe answer: Catawba, as they are the only Siouan-speaking tribe mentioned in the passage.", "{3, 7, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage lists several Native American tribes in different regions, including the Great Lakes region. The French recruited fighters from tribes in this region, including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi. \nThe answer: the Great Lakes region", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations and the Cherokee, but the latter eventually sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. Therefore, the answer is: the Iroquois Six Nations and the Cherokee.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: no regular army troops stationed in North America", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"few British troops\" were stationed in North America at the start of the war. This implies that the number of British military was small.\nThe answer: few", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The passage states that most British colonies mustered local militia companies to deal with native threats, but did not have any standing forces. This means that the normal British defense was to rely on local militia rather than maintaining a standing army.\nThe answer: relying on local militia companies", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The expedition covered about 3,000 miles between June and November 1749, going up the St. Lawrence, continuing along the northern shore of Lake Ontario, crossing the portage at Niagara, following the southern shore of Lake Erie, moving inland to the Allegheny River, and following it to the site of present-day Pittsburgh.\nThe answer: About 3,000 miles.", "{rule list: 4, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is relevant because it helps us understand that the question is asking about the people on the expedition, not their professions or nationalities. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is relevant because the question is asking for the subject of the sentence, and the sentence is in the passive voice. Therefore, we need to look for the antonym of \"buried\" to find the subject. \nThe answer: about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians", "{rule list: 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: C\u00e9loron informed British merchants or fur-traders of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave, indicating a negation of allowing them to conduct business. \nThe answer: He told British merchants or fur-traders to leave.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"the Native Americans in the area informed C\u00e9loron that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British regardless of the French.\" This implies that they did not take C\u00e9loron's warning seriously and intended to continue trading with the British. The use of the word \"regardless\" indicates a negation, which is important for the answer.\nThe answer: They would trade with the British regardless of the French.", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that \"Old Briton\" was the chief of the village of Pickawillany. The negation in the question (\"call home\") is important to note, as it implies that the answer should be a specific location. \nThe answer: Pickawillany", "{rule list: 16, 18}\nExplanation: C\u00e9loron threatened \"Old Briton\" with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the British.\nThe answer: He threatened him with severe consequences.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: Old Briton ignored Celeron's warning.\nThe answer: ignored", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: C\u00e9loron wrote that the Natives were \"very badly disposed towards the French\" and \"entirely devoted to the English\", indicating a negative relationship between the French and the Natives. Therefore, he felt negatively about Native relations.\nThe answer: negatively", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and profession and nationality are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 3 is also not relevant as there is no mention of any of those concepts. Rule 4 is relevant as it distinguishes between leaders and their feelings. Rule 8 is relevant as it deals with comparisons. Rule 17 is relevant as it deals with negations. \nThe answer: They were proposing that action be taken.", "{4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can't assume that William Shirley's nationality has any bearing on his opinion of French advancement. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that Shirley was forceful in his opposition to French advancement, we can infer that he was not in favor of it. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"not\" in the question.\nThe answer: He was not in favor of it.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 1749", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country.\" This means that the entity given land was the Ohio Company of Virginia.\nThe answer: Ohio Company of Virginia", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Christopher Gist", "{3, 5, 13}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the Treaty of Logstown, which was an agreement made between Christopher Gist, representing Virginia and the Ohio Company, and the local Indian tribes, including the \"Half-King\" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative. The agreement included permission to build a \"strong house\" at the mouth of the Monongahela River for trade and settlements in the Ohio Country. \nThe answer: permission to build a \"strong house\" at the mouth of the Monongahela River for trade and settlements in the Ohio Country.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Treaty of Logstown included permission to build a \"strong house\" at the mouth of the Monongahela River, which is the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nThe answer: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "{3, 13}\nExplanation: The article states that the North American theater of the War of the Austrian Succession is known as King George's War. This is the relevant information needed to answer the question.\nThe answer: King George's War", "{rule list: 2, 12, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are 2 (comparing the end of the war to its beginning), 12 (ignoring irrelevant information), and 16 (ordering information chronologically). The answer: The War of the Austrian Succession formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The treaty was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe, but the issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America were turned over to a commission to resolve, but it reached no decision. Therefore, the issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America were not addressed in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.\nThe answer: conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that a commission was tasked with resolving the territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America, but it reached no decision. \nThe answer: Nothing happened, no decision was reached.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Marquis de la Jonqui\u00e8re", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Langlade was given 300 men.\nThe answer: 300", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following C\u00e9loron's orders to cease trading with the British.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage does not explicitly state the result of the French attack, but it does mention that they captured three traders and killed 14 people of the Miami nation, including Old Briton, who was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some aboriginal members of the expedition. Therefore, it can be inferred that the result of the French attack was the capture of traders and the killing of Miami people. \nThe answer: The French captured three traders and killed 14 people of the Miami nation, including Old Briton.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the first sentence of the article, which is in the passive voice. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we need to look for the object of the sentence, which is \"a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians.\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so we can identify the name \"Paul Marin de la Malgue\" as the person who was given command of this force. \nThe answer: Paul Marin de la Malgue", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the first fort built by Marin, implying that he built more than one. Rule 3 applies because the location of the fort is relevant to the answer. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the first fort, implying that Marin built others after it.\nThe answer: Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania)", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The rule of \"if A moves from place X to place Y, then A is in place Y\" applies here. Marin first constructed Fort Presque Isle and then moved south to construct a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf. Therefore, the answer is \"Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania)\". \nThe rule of \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" also applies, as Fort Le Boeuf is mentioned after Fort Presque Isle in the passage.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British", "{3, 16, 20}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the physical characteristics of the chief are not relevant. The order of events is important, so rule 16 applies. The use of \"he\" indicates that the chief is male, so rule 20 applies.\nThe answer: Tanaghrisson", "{rule list: 4, 15}\nExplanation: William Johnson was a British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond, and later commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia. \nThe answer: colonel", "{rule list}\nExplanation: The article states that William Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey.\nThe answer: Warraghiggey", "{rule list: 13, 20}\nExplanation: The Iroquois referred to William Johnson as Warraghiggey, which means \"He who does great things.\" This is a name or title given to him by the Iroquois, indicating their respect for him. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, and rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names. \nThe answer: Warraghiggey", "{rule list: 16, 22, 13}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the name of the Mohawk Chief who was the Speaker of their tribal council. Rule 16 helps to identify that the first name mentioned in the passage is likely the person being referred to. Rule 22 helps to identify that \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last. Rule 13 helps to identify that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Mohawk Chief Hendrick", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: Dinwiddie was an investor in the Ohio Company, as was Washington's brother. Therefore, Dinwiddie had an investment in the Ohio Company.\nThe answer: Ohio Company", "{1, 13, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the person who was ordered to address the French, and the passage states that Dinwiddie ordered Major George Washington. Rule 13 applies because names are important for the answer, as the question specifically asks for the person who was ordered. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for the person who was ordered, and the passage provides the name of the person who was ordered. \nThe answer: Major George Washington", "{rule list} \nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Jacob Van Braam and Christopher Gist", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: This question is asking for a specific time-related detail, so rule 16 (first comes before last and last comes after first) is the most relevant. The passage states that Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf on December 12, so the answer is December 12. \nThe answer: December 12.", "{rule list: names are equally important for the answer}\nExplanation: The passage states that Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre invited Washington to dine with him.\nThe answer: Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: a letter demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country", "{rule list: 16, 17, 23}\nExplanation: Saint-Pierre said, \"As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.\"\nThe answer: He did not think himself obliged to obey the summons.", "{rule list: 3, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The French felt they had a superior claim to the Ohio Country because Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had explored the region nearly a century earlier. This is a matter of historical fact and does not involve size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles. The answer is not affected by the order of events or any negations. \nThe answer: Because La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrec\u0153ur to relieve Saint-Pierre during the same period, and Contrec\u0153ur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5, 1754.\nThe answer: 500 men", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to begin construction of a small stockaded fort \"even before Washington returned.\" Therefore, the construction began before Washington's return.\nThe answer: before Washington's return", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Fort Duquesne", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with the Mingo leader and surprised the Canadians in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen.\nThe answer: He surprised the Canadians in the Battle of Jumonville Glen.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer Joseph Coulon de Jumonville", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to gain the support of the British and regain authority over his own people", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: to dislodge the French", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: well before Braddock's departure for North America", "{rule list: 3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755.\nThe answer: He dispatched six regiments to New France.", "{3, 4, 6, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are different concepts, so any information about them is irrelevant to the answer. Profession and nationality are also different concepts, so any information about them is irrelevant to the answer. Animals and vehicles are different concepts, so any information about them is irrelevant to the answer. Negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"dislodge\" in the passage. \nThe answer: To dislodge the French.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that applies is rule 1, as it compares the importance of the Albany Congress to other political responses to the opening of hostilities. The answer is also found using rule 16, as it asks for the specific event that occurred in June and July of 1754. \nThe answer: The convening of the Albany Congress.", "{rule list: 1, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The goal of the Albany Congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians. This is stated directly in the passage and can be extracted without any need for additional context or inference. The irrelevant information about the plan not being ratified or approved can be ignored. The negation in the question (\"what was the goal\") is important to note. \nThe answer: to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the goal of the Albany Congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians, and that the plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown. Therefore, the plan was not formalized.\nThe answer: No", "{1, 3, 6, 12, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the importance of the congress, implying that it was significant in some way. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for the importance, not the size, shape, age, or color of the congress. Rule 6 applies because the question asks about the congress, not about animals or vehicles. Rule 12 applies because some information in the article is not relevant to the answer. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for the importance, not the lack of importance, of the congress.\nThe answer: The congress was an important political response to the opening of hostilities and became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence \"Braddock (with George Washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne\" indicates that Braddock, with George Washington as one of his aides, went to Fort Duquesne in June 1755.\nThe answer: Braddock, with George Washington as one of his aides", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: The expedition led by Braddock was a disaster and resulted in a retreat, with approximately 1,000 British soldiers killed or injured. Therefore, the expedition did not find much success.\nThe answer: not much success", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured.\" This means that there were around 1,000 casualties among the British troops.\nThe answer: approximately 1,000", "{4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule that \"profession and nationality are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" is relevant because it helps identify the names of the key figures. \nThe answer: George Washington and Thomas Gage", "{rule list: 13, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the French acquired a copy of the British war plans, which included the activities of Shirley and Johnson. The use of \"including\" indicates that Shirley's activities were part of the larger set of plans that the French gained knowledge of. The negation in the question (\"whose activities were the French able to gain knowledge of?\") is important to note, as it asks for the subject of the sentence rather than the object. \nThe answer: Shirley's activities", "{3, 12}\nExplanation: The passage states that Shirley's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by his inexperience in managing large expeditions.\nThe answer: logistical difficulties", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that Shirley is the subject being acted upon by the verb \"made aware.\" The sentence also mentions that Shirley planned to attack Fort Niagara, indicating that he would not be at Fort Oswego during the attack.\nThe answer: He was planning to attack Fort Niagara.", "{rule list: 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Shirley left garrisons at Oswego, Fort Bull, and Fort Williams. Since Oswego is mentioned first, it can be inferred that this is the garrison being referred to.\nThe answer: garrisons", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the governor of New France. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the answer cannot be a profession. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so the answer will likely be a single name rather than a full title. \nThe answer: the Marquis de Vaudreuil", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet the threat posed by Johnson, indicating that he considered Johnson to be a greater threat than Shirley. Rule 1 applies because \"larger threat\" implies that Johnson was more of a threat than Shirley, and therefore Shirley was less of a threat than Johnson. Rule 8 applies because the question uses the word \"react\", which implies a response to a situation.\nThe answer: He sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet the threat posed by Johnson.", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Battle of Lake George ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Therefore, neither side won the battle.\nThe answer: Neither side", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, which is mentioned after the Battle of Lake George, indicating that it was the last location mentioned in the passage. Therefore, we can apply rule 16 to determine that Johnson stopped at Fort William Henry.\nThe answer: Fort William Henry", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point. This information is presented in a passive sentence, where the subject (French) is acted upon the verb (withdrew). Therefore, rules 16 and 23 are relevant, as they help identify the location of the French withdrawal and the structure of the sentence. \nThe answer: Ticonderoga Point", "{rule list: 1, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that \"Colonel Monckton... captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour in June 1755.\" This means that Monckton was the one who captured the fort.\nThe answer: Colonel Monckton", "{3, 9, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 9 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the British were able to cut supplies to Louisbourg by deporting the French-speaking Acadian population from the area, which is a negative action. Rule 16 is relevant because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, the answer is: By deporting the French-speaking Acadian population from the area.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: There were no other clashes involved in taking Louisbourg.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying who assumed command of British forces in North America after Braddock's death. This requires understanding the passive sentence structure in the sentence \"Following the death of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America.\" Rule 16 helps to identify that \"following\" means after, and rule 23 helps to understand that the subject is acted upon in a passive sentence. \nThe answer: William Shirley", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes a meeting in Albany in December 1755 where William Shirley laid out his plans for 1756.\nThe answer: Albany meeting", "{3, 7, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the specific attacks that William Shirley proposed. The passage mentions that Shirley proposed attacks on Fort Frontenac and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudi\u00e8re River to attack the city of Quebec. These are the only proposed attacks mentioned in the passage. Therefore, rules 3 (focus on specific concepts), 7 (look for exact wording), and 16 (order matters) are relevant. \nThe answer: attacks on Fort Frontenac and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudi\u00e8re River to attack the city of Quebec.", "{rule list: 3, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Shirley was planning an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudi\u00e8re River to attack the city of Quebec.\nThe answer: Maine district and Chaudi\u00e8re River", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Lord Loudoun was appointed as a replacement in January 1756, with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command. Rule 16 helps us understand that \"second in command\" refers to the person who is next in authority after the main leader. Rule 23 helps us understand that passive voice is used in the sentence \"Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers France sent to North America.\" The answer: James Abercrombie.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm", "{rule list: 17, 22}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that \"on May 18, 1756, England formally declared war on France.\" Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for the date of the declaration of war, which is a negation. Rule 22 is relevant because the date is mentioned in the same sentence as other information, and \"former\" and \"latter\" are not applicable. \nThe answer: May 18, 1756", "{rule list: 1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain, indicating that the British supply chain was less strong than the French had anticipated. Therefore, the weakness in the British supply chain is less strength than the French had anticipated.\nThe answer: at the forts Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an attack against the forts Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder\" were destroyed in the attack.\nThe answer: 45,000 pounds", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the attack on the forts set back the British plans. Rule 3 applies because the question asks about plans, which is a different concept than the attack itself. Rule 16 applies because the attack happened before reinforcements arrived, indicating that the British had plans to reinforce their position. \nThe answer: The attack set back British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario.", "{1, 16}\nExplanation: Abercrombie arrived in Albany but refused to take significant actions until Loudoun approved them.\nThe answer: Abercrombie", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because Montcalm's action of moving his headquarters was a strategic advancement that Abercrombie did not take. Rule 3 applies because the location of Montcalm's headquarters is a different concept from the actions he took there. Rule 16 applies because Montcalm's action of moving his headquarters happened before the attack on Oswego. \nThe answer: Ticonderoga", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can infer that Moncalm slipped away to attack a place that was largely unprotected. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can infer that Moncalm slipped away to attack Oswego. \nThe answer: Oswego", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the disposition of prisoners' personal effects", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Loudoun planned one major operation for 1757, which was an attack on New France's capital, Quebec.\nThe answer: Loudoun planned an attack on Quebec.", "{rule list: 4, 12, 16}\nExplanation: Loudoun left a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm.\nThe answer: to distract Montcalm", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The answer can be found by identifying the person who gave the order to Loudoun. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so we can ignore any information about their respective nationalities. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we can assume that the first person mentioned in the sentence is the one who gave the order. Therefore, the answer is William Pitt.\nThe answer: William Pitt", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Loudoun returned to New York, implying that he did not proceed with the attack on Louisbourg.\nThe answer: returned to New York", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians)", "{3, 7, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage describes the attack on Fort William Henry, including a raid across a frozen lake. Rule 3 reminds us that location is important for the answer, and rule 7 reminds us that synonyms may be used in the question. Rule 12 tells us that irrelevant information can be ignored. Rule 17 reminds us that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Lake George", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: attacked the British column, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the British blockade limited French shipping, there was a poor harvest, and the allegedly corrupt actions of Fran\u00e7ois Bigot inflated prices. The question asks for the cause of issues with resupplying. \nThe answer: British blockade, poor harvest, and corrupt actions of Fran\u00e7ois Bigot.", "{3, 10}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter.\" This indicates that the difficult winter was a separate reason for the poor supply of New France. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. \nThe answer: a difficult winter", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Montcalm focused his resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg. This indicates that Montcalm was focusing the defense for New France on the St. Lawrence, specifically at these three locations.\nThe answer: Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Newcastle's failures in North America and other failures in the European theater led to his fall from power as military advisor, along with his principal military advisor, the Duke of Cumberland. \nThe answer: failures in North America and other failures in the European theater", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: Abercrombie replaced Loudoun as commander in chief after the failures of 1757, who had developed the plan for the 1758 campaign largely adopted by Pitt.\nThe answer: Loudoun", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops, supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Two", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"3,600 Frenchmen famously and decisively defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia and Native American allies outside the fort.\" This is a passive sentence, meaning that the subject (Abercrombie's force) was acted upon by the verb (defeated). Therefore, the answer is 3,600.\nThe answer: 3,600", "{rule list: 1, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the article states that the French force of 3,600 defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for the number of troops defeated, which is the antonym of \"victory\". \nThe answer: 18,000", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: Abercrombie experienced a disaster and was recalled.\nThe answer: he was recalled", "{1, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for duc de Choiseul's plan for focused military efforts in 1758. Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. This means that if the French had poor results in most theaters of the Seven Years' War in 1758, then they were not focusing their military efforts. Rule 4 is also relevant because it establishes that profession and nationality are different concepts, so the fact that duc de Choiseul was France's foreign minister does not necessarily mean that his plan was related to his profession. Rule 17 is relevant because it establishes that negations are important for the answer, so the fact that the question uses the word \"focused\" implies that there was a specific plan in place. \nThe answer: There was no plan for focused military efforts in 1758.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: The invasion failed both militarily and politically.", "{rule list: 3, 5, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay.\" Rule 3 states that shape, size, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about the battles. Rule 5 states that animals and vehicles are different concepts, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information about land battles. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the word \"failed\" to determine that France lost the battles. \nThe answer: Lagos and Quiberon Bay", "{rule list: 4, 16}\nExplanation: The rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and the rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first. Therefore, we can identify that James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec.\nThe answer: James Wolfe", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The victory at Fort Niagara successfully cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south.\nThe answer: It cut off the French frontier forts further to the west and south.", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is referring to a battle that the British lost, so we need to use rule 17 to consider negations. Additionally, the question specifies that the battle was outside Quebec City, so we need to use rule 16 to determine the location. \nThe answer: Battle of Sainte-Foy", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Battle of the Restigouche", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The sentence is in the active voice, with Governor Vaudreuil as the subject and the action of negotiating a capitulation. Therefore, we can use rule 16 to determine that Governor Vaudreuil negotiated the capitulation. Additionally, the sentence mentions that the negotiation was \"from Montreal,\" which indicates a location and suggests that the sentence is describing a specific event. Therefore, we can use rule 23 to determine that the sentence is in the past tense. \nThe answer: Governor Vaudreuil", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: The passage describes Governor Vaudreuil's negotiations with General Amherst before any hostilities erupted. Vaudreuil requested that French residents who chose to remain in the colony be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, continued ownership of their property, and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes. The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.\nThe answer: freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, continued ownership of their property, and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes.", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that Governor Vaudreuil negotiated a capitulation with General Amherst at Montreal. This is a passive sentence, meaning that General Amherst is the one who was negotiated with. Rule 16 tells us that in a list of two entities, \"former\" refers to the first and \"latter\" to the last. Since there is only one entity listed here, we can use rule 23 to determine that the subject of a passive sentence is the entity being acted upon by the verb. Therefore, the answer is General Amherst.\nThe answer: General Amherst", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The article states that \"The war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763.\" This is a passive sentence, where the subject (the war in North America) is acted upon the verb (ended). Rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the Treaty of Paris ended the North American French and Indian War. Rule 23 states that in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, the answer is \"10 February 1763.\" \nThe answer: 10 February 1763.", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: The Treaty of Hubertusburg settled the European theatre of the Seven Years' War. The article states that this treaty was signed on February 15, 1763, which is the answer to the question.\nThe answer: February 15, 1763.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that the British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. This is an example of a comparison between two options, which falls under rules 1 and 2. Additionally, the question asks about the choice that France had, which involves the concept of nationality, covered by rule 4.\nThe answer: surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that France viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. Therefore, France chose to cede its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi. \nThe answer: France viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that Britain gained control of colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. This means that the British gained control of 80,000 French colonists. The use of the word \"primarily\" in the passage indicates that there may have been some non-French residents in the colonies, but the question specifically asks about French colonists, so the answer is 80,000.\nThe answer: 80,000", "{rule list: 16, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that \"The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755\" which means that the event happened in 1755 or after.\nThe answer: 1755", "{1, 3, 4, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces.\" Rule 1 is applied to understand that \"its\" refers to British. Rule 3 is applied to understand that \"North American provinces\" refers to regions under British control. Rule 4 is applied to understand that \"Acadians\" refers to French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. Rule 8 is applied to understand that \"resettled\" means to move to a new location. \nThe answer: North American provinces", "{rule list: 3, 4, 5, 6, 12}\nExplanation: The question asks for a specific North American city where many Acadians moved to. Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 help to eliminate irrelevant information about other destinations and concepts. Rule 12 allows us to ignore information about the unsuccessful colonization efforts in other places. \nThe answer: New Orleans", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The subject of the sentence \"King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763\" is King George III, and the sentence is in the active voice. Therefore, we can use rules 16 and 23 to determine that King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763.\nThe answer: King George III", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the sentence \"Following the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations.\" The word \"outlined\" suggests that the proclamation had a specific objective. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate answers that refer to those concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can eliminate answers that suggest the opposite of the objective. The answer is: to outline the division and administration of the newly conquered territory.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: lands west of the Appalachian Mountains", "{rule list: 3, 12, 13, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer can be found in the last sentence of the passage, which states that most Spanish Catholics moved to Cuba. The irrelevant information in the passage includes the history of British and Spanish control in North America and the tensions between different tribes. The names and locations mentioned in the passage are important for the answer. The negation in the question (\"did not want to do business with the British\") is important for understanding the context of the answer. The answer is: Cuba.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the Ohio Country was vulnerable to settlement due to the construction of military roads by Braddock and Forbes. This implies that the area was not well-protected and therefore more susceptible to colonization. \nThe answer: The construction of military roads", "{rule list: 3, 10, 12, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769, indicating that it was not complete before that year. Rule 3 reminds us that concepts such as location and time are different and should not be confused. Rule 10 states that typos in the question are irrelevant to the answer. Rule 12 reminds us that some passages in the context may be irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 reminds us that negations in the question are important for the answer.\nThe answer: 1769", "{rule list: 3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The article mentions that the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British, leading to the ultimate dispossession of many native populations. This implies that the natives displaced by the British takeover in Florida were those who did not want to do business with the British. The article does not provide specific information about which tribes or groups of natives were displaced. The relevant rules are 3 (to distinguish between concepts such as natives and British), 4 (to distinguish between concepts such as nationality and displacement), 8 (to consider the negation in the question), and 17 (to consider the importance of negations). \nThe answer: The article does not provide specific information about which natives were displaced by British takeover in Florida.", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: France lost a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to the dispossession of many native populations. \nThe answer: The loss of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion.", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force to study stationary and moving objects and simple machines.\nThe answer: force", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity.", "{rule list: 16, 20}\nExplanation: The rule 16 states that \"first comes before last and last comes after first\" and the rule 20 states that \"he\" refers to male names and \"she\" refers to female names. Therefore, we can infer that \"Sir Isaac Newton\" had mathematical insight.\nThe answer: Sir Isaac Newton", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: nearly three hundred years", "{3, 4, 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who developed the theory of relativity, which is mentioned in the last sentence of the passage. The relevant rules are 3 (different concepts), 4 (profession and nationality are different concepts), 16 (first comes before last), and 23 (passive voice). The answer is Einstein. \n\nThe answer: Einstein", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The Standard Model is a description of forces between particles smaller than atoms, and it predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. The model includes four main interactions: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational. The answer is: a Standard Model.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Therefore, the answer is gauge bosons. \nThe answer: gauge bosons", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"strength\" is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color (rule 3) is relevant because the question asks about the \"strongest\" interaction. The rule that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A (rule 8) is also relevant because the interactions are listed in order of decreasing strength. \nThe answer: strong", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"strength\" is a comparative concept falls under rule 3, and the rule that \"in order of decreasing strength\" implies that the weakest interaction is listed last falls under rule 8.\nThe answer: gravitational", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the expressions of weak and electromagnetic forces. Rule 3 states that concepts such as forces are different from concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of the more fundamental electroweak interaction.\nThe answer: electroweak interaction", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a person who discussed the concept of force in a philosophical context. Rule 1 applies because it involves a comparison between Aristotle and other possible candidates. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the answer should be a person's name, not a description of their profession or nationality.\nThe answer: Aristotle", "{rule list: 4, 13}\nExplanation: The concept of force was a part of Aristotelian cosmology, which is a philosophical discussion according to the article. This falls under rule 4, which states that profession and nationality are different concepts, and rule 13, which states that names are equally important for the answer.\nThe answer: Aristotelian cosmology", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Aristotle believed that the terrestrial sphere contained four elements. \"Terrestrial sphere\" refers to the Earth, and \"four\" is a numerical value that indicates the quantity of elements. \nThe answer: four", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: According to rule 3, size, shape, age, and color are different concepts. Therefore, the natural place for earth and water elements is not related to their size, shape, age, or color. According to rule 8, if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, if motionless objects composed mostly of earth and water are in their natural place on the ground, then their antonym, which is motionless objects not composed mostly of earth and water, are not in their natural place on the ground. \nThe answer: Motionless objects composed mostly of earth and water are in their natural place on the ground.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: unnatural or forced motion", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that the shortcomings of Aristotelian physics were not fully corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei. Therefore, the answer is \"in the 17th century\". The relevant rules are:\n1. if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\n3. size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\n16. first comes before last and last comes after first\n\nThe answer: in the 17th century", "{rule list: 23, 16, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who corrected Aristotle's physics in the seventeenth century. Rule 23 is relevant because it distinguishes between active and passive sentences, which is important for understanding that Galileo's work corrected Aristotle's physics. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that chronological order matters, and Galileo's work came after Aristotle's. Rule 8 is relevant because it establishes that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and in this case, Galileo's work corrected Aristotle's physics, so it is the antonym of Aristotle's physics. \nThe answer: Galileo Galilei", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: an innate force of impetus", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Galileo Galilei", "{2, 3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X\" applies because the question asks about a force that retards velocity, implying that the force acts against the object's motion. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" does not apply because none of these concepts are mentioned in the article. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" applies because the question asks about a force that retards velocity, implying that the force acts against the object's motion. \nThe answer: friction", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the author of the First Law of Motion, which is Newton. This is a factual question that requires knowledge of the subject matter. Rules 16 and 23 are relevant because they establish the importance of identifying the subject of a sentence and understanding the difference between active and passive voice. \nThe answer: Newton", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for an insight associated with constant velocity, which is mentioned in the article as being \"associated with a lack of net force.\" This is a negation, which is important to note according to rule 17. Additionally, this information is not related to size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, or vehicles, so rules 3 and 8 apply. \nThe answer: constant velocity is associated with a lack of net force", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 is relevant because it establishes a relationship between innate inertia and the Aristotelian idea of the \"natural state of rest\". Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of innate inertia and the natural state of rest. Rule 16 is relevant because it establishes that Newton proposed the concept of innate inertia. \nThe answer: Newton", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires understanding the connection between relative velocities and inertia, which is explained in the passage. Rule 3 is relevant to ensure that size, shape, age, and color are not confused with the concepts of relative velocities and inertia. Rule 8 is relevant because the question asks for a law that connects two concepts, and the answer involves understanding the relationship between those concepts. Rule 17 is relevant because the question asks for a law that connects two concepts, and negations are important for understanding the relationship between those concepts. \nThe answer: Newton's First Law of Motion", "{3, 8, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the laws of physics of Galileo, which is the opposite of Newton's First Law, so we need to use the antonym of \"objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force.\" Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, so we need to focus on the first sentence of the passage. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. Therefore, the answer is that Galileo's insight was that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The laws of physics\nThe answer: laws of physics", "{3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 8, however, is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the question asks about the path of a ball thrown up and down in a moving vehicle as seen by an outside observer. The passage explains that the ball follows a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle, which means that from the perspective of an outside observer, the ball would appear to curve in the opposite direction of the vehicle's motion. Finally, Rule 16 is relevant because it states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is not directly relevant to the question but helps ensure that the answer is concise and clear. \n\nThe answer: The ball follows a curving parabolic path in the opposite direction of the vehicle's motion as seen by an outside observer.", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is also not relevant. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, which is relevant because the question asks about the state of things inside a moving vehicle as seen by a person inside the vehicle. The answer is that from the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest.", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how the laws of physics remain the same for a person in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity as they do for a person at rest. This means that the concept of inertia applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.\nThe answer: inertia", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that objects tend to continue in constant motion. Rule 3 applies because the article distinguishes between different types of motion. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a concept that explains constant motion. \nThe answer: inertia", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What prevents day length from changing on Earth?\" Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so we can rephrase the sentence \"The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year\" as \"The constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year is fixed by the rotational inertia of planet Earth.\" \nThe answer: Rotational inertia of planet Earth.", "{rule list: 1, 2, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who explained that inertial reference frames equaled reference frames subject to constant acceleration, which is a negation. Therefore, rule 17 is relevant. The answer is Albert Einstein, who extended the principle of inertia to explain the equivalence of reference frames subject to constant acceleration. This involves a comparison between two concepts, which is covered by rules 1 and 2. \nThe answer: Albert Einstein", "{rule list: 2, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 2 applies because the question mentions \"experience\" which is a subjective term, and the article mentions \"weightlessness\" which is a more objective term to describe the sensation of being in free-fall. Rule 23 applies because the article explains that free-falling reference frames are physically equivalent to inertial reference frames, meaning that objects in free-fall will behave as if they have no weight. \nThe answer: weightlessness", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the principle of equivalence", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the sentence states that Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Rule 3 applies because force and mass are different concepts. \nThe answer: Newton's Second Law", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The article explains that accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements, which are measurements related to motion. This is a concept related to physics and the study of motion. \nThe answer: kinematic measurements", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The article mentions that general relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass. This is a concept from physics and is related to the theory of relativity. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so we can eliminate any irrelevant information related to those concepts. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. In this case, the sentence is in the active voice, so we can identify that the equivalence is between mass and space-time.\nThe answer: mass", "{3, 4, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for something that is unclear or missing, which implies a negation. Therefore, rules 3 and 4 are relevant to distinguish between different concepts and avoid confusion. Rule 8 is also relevant to handle the comparison between what is missing and what is known. Finally, rule 17 is relevant to consider the negation in the question. \nThe answer: a coherent theory of quantum gravity", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the units of mass and force in relation to microscales, which implies that the answer should take into account the context of microscales. Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from other concepts, so the units of mass and force may differ at different scales. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, since the article mentions that it is unclear how or whether the equivalence between space-time and mass is relevant on microscales, it can be inferred that the units of mass and force may not be the same on microscales as they are on larger scales. Thus, the answer is that the units of mass and force on microscales may differ from those on larger scales.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it clarifies that if A exerts a force on B, then B exerts a force on A of equal magnitude but opposite direction. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of forces and objects. Rule 17 applies because it emphasizes the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Newton's Third Law", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: This question is asking for a specific law related to forces and interactions between bodies. Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different and not relevant to each other. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The answer to the question is Newton's Third Law.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Newton's third law states that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body. Therefore, a force that acts on only one body does not exist under Newton's third law.\nThe answer: unidirectional force", "{1, 8}\nExplanation: If A exerts a force F on B, then B exerts a force -F on A, and the forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\nThe answer: The forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.", "{3, 8, 23}\nExplanation: The third rule states that \"acceleration\" is a different concept from \"particles\" and \"internal forces.\" The eighth rule states that if an entity experiences more of a certain property than another entity, then the latter experiences more of the antonym of that property than the former. The twenty-third rule states that if an external force acts on a system, then the center of mass of the system experiences acceleration. \nThe answer: the center of mass of the system", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between two entities based on a comparative attribute. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: closed system", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"mathematical concepts are different from physical concepts\" (rule 3) applies here, as the question is asking for the magnitude of force divided by something, which is a mathematical concept. Additionally, the rule that \"negations are important for the answer\" (rule 8) applies, as the question is asking for the division of the magnitude of force by something, not the multiplication. \nThe answer: the mass of the system", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because pushing and pulling are opposite actions, and Rule 3 applies because perception and description are different concepts.\nThe answer: an intuitive understanding", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: The article states that the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. This means that the concept of force is given a specific definition and measured using a standard scale. \nThe answer: precise operational definitions", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, which provides an intuitive understanding for describing forces. This intuitive understanding is then quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Therefore, the conceptual definition of force is offered by Newtonian mechanics.\nThe answer: Newtonian mechanics", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that laboratory measurements of forces are determined through experimentation, which is a direct observation consistent with the operational definitions and standard measurement scale. The negation rule (17) is also relevant as it emphasizes the importance of negations in the question. \nThe answer: Through experimentation.", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage explains that forces are classified as \"vector quantities\" because they have direction and magnitude, which means they follow different mathematical rules than scalar quantities. \nThe answer: Forces are classified as \"vector quantities\".", "{rule list: size, shape, age, and color are different concepts; profession and nationality are different concepts; animals and vehicles are different concepts}\nExplanation: Scalar quantities are physical quantities that do not have direction, such as size, shape, age, and color. They are different concepts from profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles, which are not physical quantities. \nThe answer: Scalar quantities", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Forces are vector quantities, meaning they have both magnitude and direction. To determine the result of multiple forces acting on an object, both the magnitude and direction of each force must be known. Without this information, the situation is ambiguous and the net force cannot be accurately calculated. By associating forces with vectors, these problems can be avoided. \nThe answer: Associate forces with vectors.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a term to describe a situation where the magnitude and direction of two forces on an object are not both known. Rule 3 states that size and direction are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The term for this situation is \"ambiguous.\" \nThe answer: ambiguous", "{3, 6}\nExplanation: Forces are vector quantities, meaning they have both magnitude and direction. To determine the acceleration of a rope when two people are pulling it, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and direction of both forces. Without knowing the direction of the forces, it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. \nThe answer: static equilibrium", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Forces are additive vector quantities, meaning they have magnitude and direction and can be added together using vector addition. If two forces act on a point particle, the resulting force, or net force, can be determined using the parallelogram rule of vector addition. The magnitude of the resultant varies depending on the angle between the lines of action of the two forces. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their lines of application must also be specified to account for their effects on the motion of the body. Since this question is asking specifically about additive quantities, rule 3 is relevant to distinguish that this refers to the concept of magnitude and direction, not size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 is also relevant to note that if forces are more or less of an additive quantity, then the opposite is true for their antonym. \nThe answer: Forces are additive vector quantities, meaning they have magnitude and direction.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the name of the force when two forces act on a particle, which implies a comparison between the two forces. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a specific term, and it is important to distinguish between different concepts. \nThe answer: resultant (or net) force", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Size, shape, and other physical properties of an extended body can affect how forces act on it, so their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.\nThe answer: The respective lines of application of the forces.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the parallelogram rule of vector addition is used to determine the net force when two forces act on a point particle. This involves adding two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram to get an equivalent resultant vector. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 are relevant. \nThe answer: parallelogram", "{rule list: 2, 5}\nExplanation: When forces are at right angles to each other, they can be resolved into independent components. This means that a horizontal force pointing northeast can be split into two forces, one pointing north and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. \nThe answer: independent components", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that the force is pointing horizontally and to the northeast does not affect the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if a force can be split into two forces, it can also be split into one force. Therefore, the answer is 2 forces.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the answer cannot be any of those. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer to \"what do you get when you figure the sum of forces with vector addition?\" is not \"subtraction\" or \"division\". Therefore, the answer is: the original force.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. For orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Therefore, the independent components of a vector sum that has been determined by scalar addition of individual vectors are the orthogonal components. \nThe answer: The orthogonal components.", "{3, 5}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates the possibility that \"orthogonal forces\" can refer to a specific size, shape, or color. The rule that \"animals and vehicles are different concepts\" is irrelevant to this question. Therefore, the answer is: three-dimensional.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: When an object is being pushed on a surface, static friction can keep it from moving. This is because the static friction force exactly balances the applied force, resulting in no acceleration and therefore no movement. This is an example of rule 1, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A. It also applies rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are therefore not relevant to the answer.", "{3}\nExplanation: The passage explains that static friction is generated between the object and the table surface when an applied force is opposed on a frictional surface. \nThe answer: Static friction", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: When there is no movement of an object on a surface, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force. This follows from rule 3, which states that static friction is generated between the object and the table surface, and rule 8, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the applied force and the static friction force are opposite and equal, resulting in no movement. \nThe answer: the applied force", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is asking for what causes static friction to increase or decrease. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the applied force increases, the static friction force will also increase, and if the applied force decreases, the static friction force will also decrease. \nThe answer: The applied force.", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article mentions that the forces are balanced in a static equilibrium. Rule 3 applies because the article mentions that the forces are measured using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances. \nThe answer: forces", "{3}\nExplanation: The only force acting on the object in addition to gravity is the \"spring reaction force\" from the spring scale.\nThe answer: spring reaction force", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for an equivalent force to balance the force of gravity, and Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a concept related to force. \nThe answer: the force applied by the spring reaction force", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from force, but it is mentioned in the passage that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the passage states that the force of gravity is proportional to volume, so the answer is that objects of constant density are defined by the force of gravity. \nThe answer: force of gravity", "{3, 16, 23}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, so the fact that the Three Laws of Motion are a concept is not relevant to the answer. Rule 16 states that first comes before last, so the fact that the other force laws were discovered before the Three Laws of Motion is not relevant to the answer. Rule 23 states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb, so the fact that the force laws were experimentally verified before the Three Laws of Motion is not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: Isaac Newton", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Galileo's description of dynamic equilibrium contradicted Aristotelian physics, which assumed a \"natural state\" of rest for objects with mass. Galileo realized that motion in a constant velocity was equivalent to rest, and simple experiments confirmed this understanding. Therefore, the answer is Galileo.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because motion at a constant velocity is the opposite of motion with changing velocity. Rule 3 applies because motion is a different concept than size, shape, age, or color. Rule 8 applies because motion at a constant velocity is the opposite of motion with changing velocity. \nThe answer: rest", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The article states that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest contradicted Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Therefore, Aristotle had the idea of a natural state for objects at rest.\nThe answer: Aristotle", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: Aristotle believed that objects with mass naturally approached a \"natural state\" of rest, so according to his physics, a cannonball dropped from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity would fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it and land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, Galileo's experiments showed that the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Therefore, the answer is behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. \nThe answer: behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about them cannot be used interchangeably. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if the question asks where the cannonball actually lands, we can infer that there is a misconception about where it should land. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to the negation in the question. \nThe answer: At the foot of the mast of the ship.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"What does not occur when traveling across a surface at a constant velocity with regard to friction?\" The answer is that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.", "{3}\nExplanation: The kinetic friction force directly opposes the force applied to move an object across a surface.\nThe answer: kinetic friction force", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that when kinetic friction is taken into consideration, it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion. This means that the absence of net force has to be accounted for in order to understand that it is the cause of constant velocity motion.\nThe answer: absence of net force", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that Aristotle misinterpreted constant velocity motion as being caused by the applied force, when in fact kinetic friction is what allows the object to continue moving with a non-zero velocity. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the role of friction in motion. \nThe answer: Aristotle", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore irrelevant to the answer. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, but there are no negations in this question. The answer is: Schr\u00f6dinger equation.", "{3, 10, 11, 16}\nExplanation: The rules state that age and equations are different concepts, contractions in the question are irrelevant, and first comes before last. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the article and cannot be determined.", "{rule list: 3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"forces\" and \"fields\" are different concepts, but they are related in that forces can be derived from fields. Therefore, the answer is that forces derived from fields are treated similarly to classical position variables. \n\nThe answer: classical position variables", "{2, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that under Schr\u00f6dinger equations, the results of a measurement are sometimes \"quantized\", meaning they appear in discrete portions. This is in contrast to classical variables, which are continuous. The use of operators instead of Newtonian variables is also mentioned. Therefore, rules 2 and 17 are relevant. \nThe answer: Quantized measurements.", "{3, 4, 17}\nExplanation: The article discusses how the notion of \"force\" retains its meaning in both classical Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, despite the use of different mathematical operators. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant to this question. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, which is also not relevant. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, which is relevant because the question asks for what notion retains its meaning in both types of physics equations. \nThe answer: \"force\"", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the name of a variable related to particles in quantum mechanics. Rule 3 tells us that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate those as possible answers. Rule 7 tells us that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for synonyms of \"variable\" in the passage. We find \"intrinsic angular momentum-like variable\" which refers to the spin of the particles. \nThe answer: spin", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The principle is called the Pauli principle and it relates the spin and space variables of identical particles. For fermions, if the spin function is symmetric, the spatial variables must be antisymmetric, and vice versa. For bosons, the correlation is strictly positive. This means that fermions cannot occupy the same space with the same spin, while bosons can. \nThe answer: The Pauli principle relates the spin and space variables of identical particles. For fermions, if the spin function is symmetric, the spatial variables must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks about the factor that determines whether particles split into fermions or bosons. Rule 3 states that concepts such as \"spin\" and \"intrinsic angular momentum\" are different from concepts such as size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article states that \"Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons.\" Therefore, the answer is the value of the spin. \n\nThe answer: the value of the spin", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that spin and spatial variables are different concepts, and rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the spin function when the apparent force is attractive, which is the opposite of what is expected for fermions. Therefore, the answer must be for bosons, which have a strictly positive correlation between spin and spatial variables. \nThe answer: symmetric", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The answer to the question is related to the Pauli principle, which is a concept in quantum mechanics. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and are not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the question asks for the spin function when the apparent force is repulsive, which means that the position variables must be antisymmetric. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and in this case, the question includes the word \"repulsive,\" which is a negation. Therefore, the answer is that the spin function must be symmetric. \nThe answer: symmetric", "{1, 3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the article states that forces and acceleration are explained as a by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Rule 3 applies because the article distinguishes between forces and momentum. Rule 8 applies because the question asks about the explanation of forces and accelerations, which is a comparison of concepts. Rule 17 applies because the question asks about a positive statement in the article. \nThe answer: explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The concept of force is considered redundant because it arises from the conservation of momentum, which is a more fundamental concept. This is explained in the passage: \"With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics).\" \nThe answer: force", "{3, 23}\nExplanation: The conservation of momentum is considered more fundamental than the concept of force in quantum field theory because it can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space. This is in line with rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 23, which states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. \nThe answer: conservation of momentum", "{3, 6, 17}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the concept of fundamental interactions in particle physics and how they can be described using Feynman diagrams. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts like force and momentum, which helps to understand the passage. Rule 6 is relevant because it emphasizes that animals and vehicles are different concepts, which is not relevant to this passage but helps to eliminate irrelevant rules. Rule 17 is relevant because it highlights the importance of negations in the question, which is important for understanding that the question is asking for the type of diagrams used, not the concept of interactions themselves. \nThe answer: Feynman diagrams", "{3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that shape is a different concept from other concepts, and a Feynman diagram represents matter particles as straight lines, which is a shape. Rule 16 states that first comes before last and last comes after first, which is relevant because the question asks about the representation of matter particles in the diagram.\nThe answer: straight lines", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that \"All of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions.\" This means that there are four interactions that all other forces in nature derive from. \nThe answer: Four", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between the strong and weak forces and their range of action. Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the strong and weak forces and the other fundamental interactions. \nThe answer: strong and weak forces", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The article states that there are four fundamental interactions in the universe, and the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges. This answer follows rule 3, which states that concepts such as \"force\" are different from concepts such as \"size, shape, age, and color,\" and rule 4, which states that concepts such as \"force\" are different from concepts such as \"profession and nationality.\" \nThe answer: electromagnetic force", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: Gravitational forces act between masses.\nThe answer: masses", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The Pauli exclusion principle prohibits atoms from passing through each other.\nThe answer: Pauli exclusion principle", "{1, 3, 16}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for the person who formed the theory, which implies that there is a comparison between different people. Rule 3 applies because the answer is about a person's achievement, not their size, shape, age, or color. Rule 16 applies because the question asks for a specific person, and in this passage, only Isaac Newton is mentioned as the person who formed the universal theory of gravitation.\nThe answer: Isaac Newton", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Quantum mechanics was developed in the 20th century.\nThe answer: 20th", "{3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, 23}\nExplanation: These rules help to identify that the question is asking about the type of models that physicists are trying to create in order to unify all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. The answer is \"self-consistent unification models\". \nThe answer: self-consistent unification models", "{3, 4, 16, 17}\nExplanation: The answer requires identifying the type of physics model that Einstein failed to make. Rules 3 and 4 help to eliminate irrelevant information about forces and unification. Rule 16 helps to identify that Einstein's attempt came before the current attempts to develop a theory of everything. Rule 17 helps to identify that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: Einstein failed to make a theory of everything.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Isaac Newton", "{2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 13, 16}\nExplanation: The passage discusses the work of Galileo in describing the characteristics of falling objects and determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. This means that falling objects fall at the same speed regardless of weight. Therefore, the answer is Galileo.\nThe answer: Galileo", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that the acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as g and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared. This means that objects fall on Earth at a rate of approximately 9.81 meters per second squared.\nThe answer: Objects fall on Earth at a rate of approximately 9.81 meters per second squared.", "{rule list: 3, 10}\nExplanation: The location where the measurement was taken is relevant to the answer, and typos in the question are irrelevant.\nThe answer: from sea level", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about what mass is proportional to. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" helps us understand that mass and force are inversely proportional, so the answer is that an object's force is proportional to its mass. \nThe answer: an object's force", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The answer is about how gravity effects might be observed differently. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which is not relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which is relevant because the question asks for how gravity effects might be observed differently. The answer is that if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law, the effects of gravity might be observed differently at larger distances.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage states that Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law. Therefore, the answer is the acceleration of the Moon.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" eliminates any confusion about what \"proportional to\" refers to. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" helps us understand that if the mass of the attracting body increases, the gravitational acceleration will also increase. \nThe answer: the mass of the attracting body.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks for what is included in a formula about rotation about the Earth, and the passage mentions that the formula relates the mass and radius of the Earth to gravitational acceleration. Therefore, the answer is the radius of the Earth. \nThe answer: radius", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that a dimensional constant is used to describe the relative strength of gravity.\nThe answer: a dimensional constant", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: Henry Cavendish", "{rule list: 2, 16}\nExplanation: The relevant rules are rule 2, which states that if A is X and B is very/somewhat X, then A is least/most X and B is most/least X, and rule 16, which states that first comes before last and last comes after first. The question asks for the timing of the first measurement of the value of the Newton Universal Gravitation Constant, so we can use rule 2 to determine that the answer will be a specific date or time period. We can then use rule 16 to identify the first instance of a date or time period mentioned in the article, which is \"Not until 1798\" when Henry Cavendish made the first measurement. \nThe answer: 1798", "{rule list: 3, 8}\nExplanation: The question asks who realized that Newton's Law of Gravitation had to be universal. The answer is Newton himself, as stated in the passage: \"Newton, however, realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion, his law of gravity had to be universal.\"\nThe answer: Newton", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a planet that did not follow Newton's Law of Gravitation. Rule 3 applies because the answer involves a concept of astronomy. \nThe answer: Mercury", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a planet that would explain the discrepancies with Mercury's orbit, implying that there is a comparison between Mercury and another planet. Rule 3 applies because the question asks for a planet, which is a different concept from Mercury's orbit. \nThe answer: Vulcan", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. Rule 9 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, Newton's Law of Gravitation was shown to be less correct than an alternative theory, which is the theory of general relativity. Rule 23 is relevant because it states that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The question asks for the theory that accounted for the Mercury problem, which is an active sentence. Therefore, the answer is the theory of general relativity. \n\nThe answer: the theory of general relativity", "{rule list: 3, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The article mentions that Albert Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity, which corrected Newton's Law of Gravitation. Therefore, we can infer that Einstein came up with the theory of relativity.\nThe answer: Albert Einstein", "{1, 8, 16}\nExplanation: The question asks for the person who first showed that Newton's Theory of Gravity was not as correct as another theory. The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it can be inferred that Albert Einstein was the one who showed this, as the passage states that he formulated his theory of general relativity to address the problem of Mercury's orbit and found a correction that could account for the discrepancy. Therefore, rules 1, 8, and 16 are relevant, as they deal with comparisons and the order of events. \nThe answer: Albert Einstein", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: General relativity is the theory that best explains gravity. In this theory, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time. This is in contrast to the traditional view of gravity as a force pulling objects towards each other. Therefore, rule 1 applies to the comparison between general relativity and other theories of gravity, and rule 3 applies to the distinction between the concepts of force and curvature of space-time. \nThe answer: general relativity", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant. Rule 9 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, so the antonym of \"straight\" is \"curved\". Rule 23 is also relevant because it explains that in GR, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time. Therefore, the answer is: the straight line path in space-time.", "{rule list: 3, 17}\nExplanation: The answer is a term used in physics, which is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Negations are important for the answer because the question asks for the derivative of momentum, not the force itself.\nThe answer: gravitational force", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: We need to understand the concept of space-time curvature and how it relates to the observation of gravitational force. \nThe answer: in a global sense", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The definition of electric current is the time rate of change of electric charge, which is stated in the passage. Rule 1 applies because it establishes a relationship between A (electric current) and B (time rate of change of electric charge). Rule 3 applies because it distinguishes between the concepts of size, shape, age, color, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles, none of which are relevant to the answer.\nThe answer: the time rate of change of electric charge", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: The question is asking for the two forces that act on a charge, which are the electrostatic force and the magnetic force. Rule 1 applies because the question is asking for a comparison between the two forces. Rule 3 applies because it clarifies that the two forces are different concepts. \nThe answer: electrostatic force and magnetic force", "{3, 7}\nExplanation: The passage describes the connection between electricity and magnetism and how it allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge. This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force (due to the magnetic field). The question asks for the name of the law that defines a charge moving through a magnetic field, which is Lorentz's Law.\nThe answer: Lorentz's Law", "3, 4\nExplanation: The passage explains that the electromagnetic force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force and the magnetic force. This means that the electrostatic force and the magnetic force are separate concepts that are added together to form the electromagnetic force.\nThe answer: The electrostatic force and the magnetic force are written as the sum of the electromagnetic force.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: James Clerk Maxwell", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: not fully explained until 1864", "{rule list: 16, 23}\nExplanation: The passage states that James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs. Rule 16 tells us that \"first comes before last and last comes after first,\" so we know that the 20 scalar equations came before the 4 vector equations. Rule 23 tells us that in an active sentence, the subject acts the verb, but in a passive sentence, the subject is acted upon the verb. The sentence \"James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations\" is in the active voice, so we know that James Clerk Maxwell formed the set of 20 scalar equations. Therefore, the answer is 20. \nThe answer: 20.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: 4", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: The passage states that Maxwell discovered that electric and magnetic fields could be \"self-generating\" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light.\nThe answer: Maxwell", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: electromagnetic theory", "{3, 5, 7, 8, 17}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. Animals and vehicles are different concepts and therefore not relevant to the answer. The question contains a synonym for \"developed\" in \"created\". The answer is \"quantum mechanics\". \nThe answer: Quantum mechanics", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: quantum electrodynamics (or QED)", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so any information about these concepts is not relevant to the answer. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if we know that photons are the wave-particles that mediate all electromagnetic phenomena, then the answer to the question is \"photons\". \nThe answer: photons", "{3, 7, 12}\nExplanation: The passage explains that a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics, which ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (QED). Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so the fact that QED is an acronym is irrelevant to the answer. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so \"short for\" can be replaced with \"an acronym for.\" Rule 12 states that some passages in the context are irrelevant to the answer, so the mention of the photoelectric effect and the ultraviolet catastrophe can be ignored. \nThe answer: Quantum Electrodynamics", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a misconception, which is the opposite of the truth. Rule 3 applies because stiffness and rigidity are properties of the structure of matter, while electromagnetic force is a different concept. Rule 8 applies because the question asks for a misconception, which is the opposite of the truth. \nThe answer: Electromagnetic force.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and therefore cannot be used interchangeably with rigidity. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the misconception is that the electromagnetic force causes rigidity, but the actual cause is the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore, the answer is not the electromagnetic force, but rather the absence of overlapping quantum mechanical states due to the Pauli exclusion principle. \nThe answer: The absence of overlapping quantum mechanical states due to the Pauli exclusion principle.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that when electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together. Therefore, energy is needed to pack electrons densely together.\nThe answer: energy", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The Pauli exclusion principle results in the need for electrons in a material to be in higher energy states when densely packed together, which requires energy to pack them together. This effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force. Negation is important because the question asks for how the principle is manifested, not what it causes. Color, profession, nationality, animals, and vehicles are not relevant concepts. The answer should focus on the manifestation of the principle in the macro world, not its definition or explanation. \nThe answer: It is manifested as a structural force.", "{1, 3, 17}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the question asks for a misconception that is often thought to be the cause of matter rigidity, but is actually not. Rule 3 applies because the passage explains that the actual cause of matter rigidity is the Pauli exclusion principle, not the repulsion of like charges. Rule 17 applies because the question asks for something that is often misunderstood, which is a form of negation. \nThe answer: The repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rules that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" and \"negations are important for the answer\" are relevant because the question asks for what actually causes rigidity, implying that the misconception mentioned in the passage is not the correct answer. The rule that \"negations in the question are important for the answer\" is also relevant because the question uses the word \"actually.\" \nThe answer: The Pauli exclusion principle.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that when electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together. Therefore, energy is needed to pack electrons densely together.\nThe answer: energy", "{rule list} 1, 3, 8, 17\nExplanation: The Pauli exclusion principle results in the need for electrons to occupy higher energy states when densely packed together, which manifests macroscopically as a structural force. This is not due to electromagnetic repulsion, as is commonly believed. The negation in the question (\"how is it not manifested\") is important, as it requires identifying the true cause of the observed phenomenon.\nThe answer: It is not manifested through electromagnetic repulsion, but rather through the need for electrons to occupy higher energy states when densely packed together.", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: The strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles. \nThe answer: elementary particles", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article explains that a residual of the strong force is observed between hadrons, which is known as the nuclear force. However, this force acts indirectly and is transmitted through gluons, which are not directly observable. Therefore, the answer is: a residual of the strong force.", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B\" is also not relevant. The answer can be found by applying the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\". The article states that the strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles, but a residual of the force is observed between hadrons, such as nucleons in atomic nuclei, as the nuclear force. Therefore, the force between nucleons is a residual of the strong force. \nThe answer: nuclear force", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The strong force acts indirectly between hadrons, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force. This is an example of the application of rule 3, which states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, and rule 9, which states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. The answer is: through virtual pi and rho mesons.", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The term for the lack of observable free quarks is \"color confinement,\" which is mentioned in the last sentence of the passage. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between the concepts of size, shape, age, color, and profession. Rule 8 is relevant because it states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A. In this case, the passage states that searches for free quarks have failed, indicating that the particles affected are not directly observable. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: color confinement", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: the weak force", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The article states that the weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons, and its most familiar effect is beta decay and associated radioactivity. Therefore, the observable effect of W and Z boson exchange is beta decay and associated radioactivity.\nThe answer: beta decay and associated radioactivity", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: Beta decay is associated with radioactivity and is the most familiar effect of the weak force, which is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons. The weak force is named as such because its field strength is much weaker than that of the strong force, but still stronger than gravity over short distances. \nThe answer: Beta decay is associated with radioactivity.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule 1 applies because the question asks for a comparison between the strength of the weak and strong forces. Rule 3 applies because the question involves concepts of size and strength. \nThe answer: 10^13 times", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The relevant information is that \"electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins.\" This means that at temperatures higher than 1015 kelvins, the weak force and electromagnetic forces are the same. \nThe answer: approximately 1015 kelvins", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they are not relevant to the answer. The rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so the answer is the antonym of \"repulsive\", which is \"attractive\". \nThe answer: attractive forces", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that when electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion occurs due to the fermionic nature of electrons, resulting in a force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. This is the explanation for the normal force. The question asks for what occurs when electron clouds overlap from different atoms, which is the same as asking what happens when there is Pauli repulsion. Therefore, rules 3 and 8 apply, as they state that concepts such as size, shape, age, and color are different, and that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. \nThe answer: Pauli repulsion occurs.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact, specifically Pauli repulsion, which is caused by the fermionic nature of electrons. This means that when two electron clouds overlap, the electrons cannot occupy the same space and repel each other. Therefore, the answer is: the fermionic nature of electrons. \nThe answer: the fermionic nature of electrons.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that the normal force is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors, which implies that it causes rigid strength in structures. The negation in the question (\"what is the force that causes rigid strength\") is important to note, as it rules out other forces that may contribute to structural integrity. \nThe answer: the normal force", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because tension forces can be compared in terms of their magnitude. Rule 3 applies because tension forces are a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: ideal strings", "{rule list: 3, 5}\nExplanation: We can use ideal pulleys to allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.\nThe answer: ideal pulleys", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so it is relevant because it helps us understand that the answer will be the opposite of \"less\" or \"not.\" \nThe answer: instantaneously", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, meaning that adding more ideal strings to a load does not affect any of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, meaning that adding more ideal strings to a load does not decrease the tension force on the load, but rather increases it. \nThe answer: The tension force on the load is multiplied.", "{1, 3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage discusses how connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of movable pulleys can multiply the tension force on a load. Rule 3 applies because tension force is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 8 applies because if the tension force on a load is increased, then the load is experiencing more tension than before. \nThe answer: connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of movable pulleys", "{rule list: 3, 16}\nExplanation: Newton's mechanics were developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects. \nThe answer: idealized point particles", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so Newton's laws and mechanics did not describe how forces affect the size, shape, age, or color of objects. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if Newton's laws did not describe how forces affect extended structures, then they did affect idealized point particles. \nThe answer: the extended structure of matter", "{3, 4}\nExplanation: The passage discusses how forces affect extended fluids, and how differences in pressure result in forces being directed along pressure gradients. This implies that pressure differences in fluids are caused by the direction of forces over gradients. Rules 3 and 4 are relevant because they help to distinguish between concepts like size and profession, and between concepts like nationality and profession, which are not relevant to the answer. \nThe answer: extended fluids", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, which implies that an object's extended structure is a different concept from its point-like idealization. Therefore, a force on one part of an object may affect other parts of the object. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the antonym of \"idealized\" is \"realistic,\" so the idealized point particles are less realistic than the extended structure of matter. \nThe answer: Other parts of the object.", "{3}\nExplanation: Newtonian mechanics doesn't address the extended structure of matter.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains (deformations) including tensile stresses and compressions. This means that any force that causes a deformation or change in shape in a structure can cause strain. Additionally, rule 8 applies because the question asks for the cause of strain, which is the opposite of what the stress tensor accounts for. \nThe answer: Forces that cause deformations or changes in shape.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size and shape are different concepts, and since cross-sectional area is related to shape, this rule is relevant. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, which means that if we know what is used to calculate cross-sectional area, we can infer what is not used. The answer is: forces that act normal and parallel to the cross-sectional area.", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is less X than A\" applies because the passage states that the pressure terms associated with normal forces are included in the stress tensor. The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" applies because normal forces are associated with pressure, which is a different concept than size, shape, age, and color. \nThe answer: pressure terms", "{3}\nExplanation: The stress tensor includes pressure terms when calculating area in volume.\nThe answer: stress tensor", "{rule list: 1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because force and torque are comparable concepts, and if torque is the rotation equivalent of force, then force is the linear equivalent of torque. Rule 3 applies because size and type of quantity are different concepts, and force and angular momentum are different types of quantities. \nThe answer: Force is the linear equivalent of torque, just as angular momentum is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum.", "{3, 9, 23}\nExplanation: Rotational inertia ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque, as a consequence of Newton's First Law of Motion. Therefore, an unbalanced torque would change the rotational inertia of a body. \nThe answer: an unbalanced torque", "{3, 4, 23}\nExplanation: We need to identify what concept is being discussed in the article and what method is used to calculate it. Rule 3 and 4 help us understand that the concept being discussed is \"instantaneous angular acceleration\" and it is a different concept from position, velocity, and momentum. Rule 23 helps us understand that the article is discussing the method to calculate the instantaneous angular acceleration of a rigid body. \nThe answer: Newton's Second Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body.", "3, 9, 23\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so it is not relevant to the answer. Rule 9 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so we can rephrase the question as \"Where does centripetal force not go?\" Rule 23 states that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path, so the answer is \"toward the center of the curving path.\"", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Centripetal forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector.", "{3, 9, 17}\nExplanation: The passage explains that the unbalanced force that changes an object's direction of travel is the radial (centripetal) force. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between concepts such as direction and speed. Rule 9 is relevant because it explains that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the force that changes an object's direction is the opposite of the force that keeps it moving in a straight line. Rule 17 is relevant because it explains that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: radial (centripetal) force", "{rule list: 3, 7}\nExplanation: Centripetal force is a concept mentioned in the article, and the question asks for a synonym. Rule 3 states that different concepts cannot be compared, so we cannot use that rule. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can use that rule to find the answer.\nThe answer: radial force", "{3, 9}\nExplanation: The rule that \"magnitude of velocity\" is different from \"direction of velocity\" (rule 3) and the rule that \"acceleration\" can either \"slow down or speed up\" an object (rule 9) are relevant. \nThe answer: The tangential force.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so potential energy is not one of these concepts. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if potential energy can only convert between kinetic or potential forms, then it cannot convert into any other form. \nThe answer: kinetic or potential forms", "{rule list: 2, 3}\nExplanation: Kinetic energy can only convert into potential energy and vice versa when a conservative force acts on a closed system.\nThe answer: potential energy", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: A conservative force acting on a closed system preserves the net mechanical energy. This is because a conservative force only allows energy to convert between kinetic and potential forms, and is related to the difference in potential energy between two locations in space. Therefore, the answer is net mechanical energy.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The force is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space. This means that if the potential energy is higher in one location than another, there is a force that will cause objects to move from the higher potential energy location to the lower potential energy location. Therefore, the force is related to the difference in potential energy. \nThe answer: the difference in potential energy", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: conservative force", "{1, 3}\nExplanation: Rule 1 applies because the passage discusses forces that cannot be modeled as gradients of potentials. Rule 3 applies because the passage distinguishes between forces and their underlying potentials. \nThe answer: Forces as being due to gradient of potentials.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" is not relevant to this question. The rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" is also not relevant. The answer to the question is that some forces are impossible to model because they arise from macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. This means that they cannot be modeled as being due to gradient of potentials.", "{rule list}\nExplanation: {rationale}\nThe answer: forces, specifically friction", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so they cannot be used to answer the question. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, so if nonconservative forces other than friction include tension, compression, and drag, then conservative forces do not include tension, compression, and drag. Therefore, tension, compression, and drag are nonconservative forces.\nThe answer: Nonconservative forces.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The rule that \"size, shape, age, and color are different concepts\" and the rule that \"if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A\" are relevant because they help us understand that nonconservative and conservative forces are opposite concepts. The passage states that the connection between these forces is described by a \"detailed treatment with statistical mechanics.\" \nThe answer: statistical mechanics", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of macroscopic closed systems. Rule 3 states that energy is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color. Rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer, and since the question asks what changes the energies, the answer is nonconservative forces. \nThe answer: nonconservative forces", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage states that nonconservative forces in macroscopic closed systems are often associated with the transfer of heat. Rule 3 states that heat is a different concept from size, shape, age, and color, and rule 17 states that negations are important for the answer. The question asks for what the exchange of heat is associated with, implying a negation of the statement in the passage that nonconservative forces are often associated with the transfer of heat. Therefore, the answer is that the exchange of heat is not associated with conservative forces.", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The passage mentions \"nonconservative forces\" being associated with the transfer of heat in closed systems, and then references the \"Second law of thermodynamics\" which states that nonconservative forces lead to an increase in entropy. Therefore, the law of thermodynamics associated with closed system heat exchange is the Second law of thermodynamics.\nThe answer: Second law of thermodynamics", "{3, 17}\nExplanation: The Second law of thermodynamics states that nonconservative forces, which act to change the internal energies of a closed system, necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases. This means that energy changes in a closed system are driven by the increase in entropy. \nThe answer: increase in entropy", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a metric term that is less commonly used than the Newton. Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so we can eliminate any answer choices that refer to those concepts. Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. Therefore, we can infer that the metric term less commonly used than the Newton is the kilogram-force (kgf). \nThe answer: kilogram-force (kgf)", "{rule list: 3, 4, 7, 10, 13}\nExplanation: The question is asking for a synonym for \"kilogram-force.\" Rule 3 states that size, shape, age, and color are different concepts, so those are not relevant. Rule 4 states that profession and nationality are different concepts, so that is also not relevant. Rule 7 states that questions may contain synonyms from words in the context paragraph, so we can look for a synonym in the article. Rule 10 states that typos in the questions are irrelevant to the answer, so we can ignore any misspellings. Rule 13 states that names are equally important for the answer, so we need to pay attention to any names mentioned in the article. Therefore, the relevant rules are 3, 4, 7, 10, and 13. The answer: kilopond.", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: Rule 3 states that size is a different concept from mass. Rule 8 states that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, the article mentions the kilogram-force as a less commonly used metric counterpart to the pound-force, and also mentions the metric slug as a unit of mass that is rarely used. Therefore, the answer is the metric slug. \nThe answer: metric slug", "{3, 8, 17}\nExplanation: The question asks for a term that is equal to 1000 pounds of force, which is the definition of a kip. Rule 3 is relevant because it distinguishes between different concepts, including force and mass. Rule 8 is relevant because it deals with antonyms, which may be used in the question or context. Rule 17 is relevant because it states that negations are important for the answer. \nThe answer: kip", "{3, 8}\nExplanation: We need to identify the unit of force that is equal to one thousand newtons. Rule 3 tells us that size and units are different concepts, so we can ignore the mention of \"one thousand\" and focus on \"newtons.\" Rule 8 tells us that if A is more X than B, then B is more antonym(X) than A, and A is less antonym(X) than B. In this case, \"kilogram-force\" is more \"newtons\" than \"sth\u00e8ne\" and \"kip,\" so they are both more \"sth\u00e8ne\" and \"kip\" than \"kilogram-force.\" Therefore, the answer is \"kilogram-force.\" \nThe answer: kilogram-force"]
